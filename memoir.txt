Summers in Spruce Pine, North Carolina were characterized by a muggy heat that made anyone who stepped outside start sweating almost instantly. Even ditzy kids like me knew better than to play outdoors in the midday. Instead, I would play in the late afternoon and early evening, when some of the moisture was mercifully absent from the air. The evening, though, brought bloodsucking mosquitos that left itchy red bumps over my arms and legs.
        More often than not, I was joined by my younger brother, David, in my outdoor playtimes. We would chase each other out the front door, shouting acknowledgement when Mom told us to be back inside before dinner. Into the yard we ran, yelling instructions to whatever game we would play that afternoon. Sometimes, we would play with a tennis ball and racket in a modified version of baseball we called bennis. Other times we were the clumsy servants to an imaginary king, serving His Majesty delicious meals of dirt, saliva, and rocks while trying not to trip over our feet. On rare occasions, Mom would connect the garden hose to sprinkler toys and let us tear through the yard in bathing suits until we were muddy messes. Those days my two reserved sisters would join us outside, jumping through ice-cold water, shrieking in harmony with the cicadas.
        Outdoor time ended with the arrival of Dad in the family’s blue minivan. David and I would race to the driveway to have the honor of first welcoming him home from a long day at work. He’d smile, jokingly comment on how strongly we smelled from playing outside, then herd us back into the house to wash up for dinner. 
        That’s how summer nights would end: the six of us, sitting around the dining room table, spending time together as a family.
