THE TWILIGHT ZONE
Season Two
"The Eye of the Beholder"
Teleplay by

ROD SERLING

Air Date: November 11, 1960

1. Standard opening With human eye changing into setting
sun. PAN DOWN TO OPENING SCENE OF PLAY.

2. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

(Production note: Throughout the play until otherwise
indicated, all characters with the exception of Janet are
played either in the shadows or the camera is on their back,
but never are actually seen face first.) The CAMERA STARTS A
SLOW DOLLY in over toward a bed which, besides a bedstand,

is the only furniture in an otherwise bare and antiseptic-
looking room. CAMERA STOPS on an ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN at
Janet Tyler, whose face is entirely swathed in a bandaged
mask, with only a little slit left open for the mouth. She
remains motionless. Even her hands are limp, unprotesting
extensions of herself, as if they too were resigned to a

life of silent darkness. There's the noise of a door swinging
open and then the very slight sound of glass medicine bottles
rattling on a tray. The bandaged face turns toward the sound:

 

CUT TO:

3. Mad. long shot across the room A nurse has just entered
and is placing the tray down near the door. The position of
the bedlight throws the far end of the room in shadows, so
that all we can see of the nurse is that of angular, tall
silhouette, her face invisible. Her voice, when she speaks,
has a brittle and professional quality, unemotional and with
a suggestion of boredom.

JBNET
Nurse?

NURSE
Brought you your sleeping medicine,
honey.

JANET

Is it night already?

NURSE
It's nine-thirty.

4. Different angle Janet As her head turns to look up toward
the ceiling.

JANET
What about the day?

NURSE
What about it?

JANET
Was it a beautiful day? Was the sun
out? Was it warm?

4.-

5. Moving shot the nurse As seen from behind her as she walks
over to the bed, administers to the bandaged woman. The camera
remains on her back.

NURSE
Kinda warm.
JANET
Clouds? Were there clouds in the

sky?
We can see the nurse shrug. Her voice becomes even duller.

NURSE
I suppose there were. I never was
much for staring up at the sky all
the time.

Now the nurse screws back the top on a medicine bottle, puts
it in her pocket, shakes down a thermometer.

JANET
I used to look up at clouds a lot.
If you stare at them long enough
they become "things." Do you know
what I mean? Ships, people, pastoral
scenes...anything you want, really,
if you stare at them long enough.

NURSE
Time to take your temperature now.

She moves the thermometer toward Janet's mouth.

JENET

Just one other thing...?
NURSE

Well?
JANET

When...when will they take the
bandages off?

6. Close shot thermometer It stops, poised in mid-air, then
travels in an are back toward the nurse's side.

7. DIFFERENT LONG ANGLE

As seen from above. The nurse has turned away, obviously
reacting to the question. Janet's head follows her.

JANET (CONT'D)
How long?

NURSE
Until...until they decide whether
they can fix up your face or not.

JANET<very softly)
Oh. I guess it's...I guess it's pretty
bad, isn't it?

8. Different angle shooting over the nurse‘s shoulder toward
Janet

NURSE
I've seen worse.

JANET
But it's pretty bad, isn't it? I
know it's pretty bad. Ever since I
can remember...ever since I was a
little girl...people have turned
away from me. The very first thing I
can remember is a little child
screaming when she looked at me.

9. Extremely tight profile shot of her bandaged face As she
once again turns away. Her voice is soft, but there is a
sense of desperation, of misery, of anguish that creeps in.

JANET (CONT'D)

I never wanted to be beautiful. I
never wanted to look like a painting.
I never even wanted to be loved.

(a pause)
I just wanted...I just wanted people
not to scream when they looked at
me.

(now the bandaged

face turns once again

toward the nurse)
When, nurse? When will they take the
bandages off this time?

10. Different angle the back of the nurse As she once again
leans over, puts the thermometer in Janet's mouth, then turns,
but so close to the camera that we are shooting her body
below the face. She passes the camera and moves again to the
opposite side of the room and into the shadows. The camera
remains on this shot.

NURSE
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
You've been waiting so long now...it
really doesn't make too much
difference whether it's two days or
weeks now, does it?

11. Reverse angle looking back over to the bed
Janet's head moves from side to side, shaking her head "no."

The nurse looks down at her watch then once again moves away
from the camera over to the bed, takes the thermometer out,

‘1-

shakes it, then in identical fashion to before, passes the
camera and goes out of the room.

CUT TO:
12. INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NIGHT

This is a long, bare, almost cavernous, tunnel—like hallway.
The lights are dim and, once again, the people who pass under
them — a doctor, another nurse, a patient - are in shadows
and we cannot see their faces. A few doors down from Janet's
room is a kind of reception desk. A nurse sits there, her
back to camera.

13. Long shot down the corridor looking toward reception
desk As Janet's nurse comes from behind the camera and starts
walking toward the desk.

14. MED. LONG SHOT INTERCOM

On the reception desk as the CAMERA MOVES TOWARD IT, staying
on the back of Janet's nurse.

15. Close shot nurse's hand As she flicks a button on the
intercom.

NURSE
Dr. Bernardi. Evening report on
Patient 307. Resting comfortably. No
temperature change.

DOCTOR'S VOICE
(over intercom)
Thank you, nurse. I'll be down later.

The nurse flicks off the button.

NURSE TWO
Ever see her face? 307?

NURSE
Indeed I have. If it were mine, I'd
bury myself in a grave someplace.
Poor thing. Some people want to live
no matter what!
(a pause)
Got a cigarette?

A pack of cigarettes passes in front of the camera. Janet‘s
nurse‘s hand moves toward the pack and takes out a cigarette,
then moves out of the frame. There‘s the sound of a match
being struck o.c., then a cloud of smoke exhaled into the

air. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND so that it is SHOOTING THROUGH
THE SMOKE across the desk, down toward the corridor and
Janet's room. At this moment we FREEZE FRAME. Two nurses
walking down the corridor away from the camera stop and become
immobile, and over this tableau we hear Serling's voice.

SERLING'S VOICE
Suspended in time and space for a
moment .

Out of Janet Tyler's room now walks Serling. Behind him we
still see the stationary figures of the nurses.

SERLING

You have been introduced to Miss
Janet Tyler, who lives in a very
private world of darkness; a universe
whose dimensions are the size,
thickness, length of a swathe of
bandages that cover her face. In a
moment we'll go back into this room,
and also in a moment we'll look under
the bandages.

(a pause)
Keeping in mind, of course, that
we're not to be surprised by what we
see, because this isn't just a
hospital. And this Patient 307 is
not just a woman. This happens to be
The Twilight Zone...and Miss Janet
Tyler, Patient number 307...with
you, is about to enter it!

FADE TO BLACK--OPENING BILLBOARD-—FIRST COMMERCIAL--FADE ON:

16. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM [NIGHT] EXTREMELY TIGHT PROFILE SHOT
BANDAGED FACE OF JANET TYLER

Beyond, at the far end of the room, are the shadowy figures
of the doctor and the nurse. We hear them indistinctly and
muffled. Occasionally words like "temperature," "pressure,"
"thyroid," "injection" can be heard above the general
indistinct rumble of their voices. Finally the doctor takes
a step toward the camera and the bed, his face still in the
shadows.

DOCTOR
(over his shoulder)
Come back about eleven, nurse. Give
her the usual sedative then.

NURSE
All right, doctor.

The CAMERA ARCS AROUND so that it is shooting behind the
doctor as he approaches the bed. He reaches it, picks up
Janet's arm, briefly checks her pulse while he looks down at
her.

DOCTOR
Warm this evening, Miss Tyler.

JANET
I thought it was. I couldn't be sure,
though.

DOCTOR
(running a hand through his collar)
Very warm. You can take my word for
it. We'll have those bandages off
you very shortly. I expect you're
uncomfortable.

JANET
I'm used to bandages on my face.

DOCTOR
I've no doubt. This is your...ninth
visit here? Is it the ninth?

JANET

The eleventh.

(a pause as she turns

her bandaged face

toward him)
Sometimes I think I've lived my whole
life inside a dark cave. The walls
are gauze. And the wind that blows
in from the mouth of the cave always
smells of ether and disinfectant.

(a pause)
There‘s a kind of a comfort though,
doctor, to living in this cave. It's
so wonderfully private.

(she turns her head

away)
No one can ever see me.

(another pause)
It's hopeless, isn't it, doctor?
I‘ll never look any different.

DOCTOR

(putting her wrist

down)
That's hard to say. Up to now you
haven't responded to the medication
or to the shots or any of the proven
techniques. Frankly, you've stumped
us, Miss Tyler. Nothing we've done
so far has made any difference at
all. But we're hopeful of what this
last treatment may have accomplished.
There's no telling, of course - not
till we get the bandages off.
Unfortunately your case is one that
can't be handled with plastic surgery.
Bone structure, flesh type...many
factors prohibit this kind of
approach.

I .

He turns away. The CAMERA ARCS AROUND with him so that he's
never full on camera.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Your eleventh Visit.

A pause. He moves over to the table, taps on it tentatively.
17. Close shot his fingers As they tap.

18. Angle shot looking across Janet toward the slouched figure
of the doctor There‘s a silence and finally Janet breaks it.

JANET
No more after this, are there? No
more tries.

DOCTOR
Eleven is the mandatory number of
experiments.
(he shrugs)
No more are permitted after eleven.

JANET
Now what?

DOCTOR
Well you're kind of jumping the gun,
Miss Tyler. You may very well have
responded to these last injections.
There's no way of telling till we
get those bandages off.

JANET
But if I haven't responded — then
what?

DOCTOR

There are alternatives.

JANET
Like?

The doctor starts to turn. WE CUT ABRUPTLY BEFORE HE GETS TO
FACE THE CAMERA TO:

DOCTOR
Don't you know?

JANET
(very softly)
I know.

DOCTOR
(approaching the bed)
You realize, of course, Miss Tyler,
why these rules are in effect?
(MORE)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Each of us is afforded as much
opportunity as possible to fit in
with society. In your case, think of
the time and money and effort expended
to make you look—

He stops abruptly. His head goes down as if searching for a
word.

JANET
To make me look like what?

DOCTOR
Normal. The way you'd like to look.

20. Different angle Janet As she rises in bed, supporting
herself on her elbows.

JANET

Doctor? May I walk outdoors? May I
sit out on the lawn? Just for a little
while. Just to smell the flowers.
Just to...just to feel the air. Just
for...just for...

(she bolts upright in

bed now. Her voice

takes on a different

tone, a strained,

tight, close—to-

breaking harshness)
To make believe, doctor! To make
believe that I ag normal. If I sit
outside in the darkness, then I kn0w
the whole world is dark. I'm more a
part of it that way. Not just one
grotesque, ugly, deformed woman with
a bandage around her face...with a
special darkness that belongs to
her.

The CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of her bandaged
face and now her voice is high, shrill, and unsteady.

JANET (CONT'D)
I want 39 belon ! I want to be like
other people. Please help me, doctor.
(now her voice catches
in a sob)
Please help me.

The CAMERA MOVES AROUND so that it is SHOOTING TOWARD THE
DOCTOR who stands in the shadows. He is silent for a moment
and then his voice is soft.

DOCTOR
You‘re not alone, Miss Tyler. You
realize that, don‘t you? You're
hardly alone. There are many others
who share your misfortune. People
who look much as you do. One of the
alternatives...should this last
treatment prove unsuccessful...well,
this is simply to allow you to move
into a special area in which people
of your own kind have been
congregated.

JANET

People of my own kind!

(a pause)
Congregated, doctor? You don't mean
congregated, you mean segregated.
You mean imprisoned. You're talking
about a ghetto now.

(and then plaintive,

anguished, and more

as a cry, she shrieks

this out)
A ghetto designed for freaks!

 

DOCTOR

(shouting)
Miss Tyler! The State is not
unsympathetic. Your presence here in
this hospital attests to this. It‘s
doing all it can for you. But you're
not being rational, Miss Tyler. You
can't expect to live any kind of
life amongst...

(again he gropes, but

picks it up quickly)
Amongst normal people.

CUT TO:

21. Close shot Janet The bandages twitch as if, underneath,
her face were contorting.

JANET

I could try. I could wear a mask or
this bandage. I wouldn't bother
anyone. I'd just go my own way. I'd
take a job. gny job.

(her voice breaks

again)
Who are you people anyway? What is
this State? Who makes up all the
rules and the statutes and the
traditions? The people who are
different have to stay away from
other people who are normal. The
State isn't God, doctor.

 

.LU.

DOCTOR
(firmly and obviously concerned)
Miss Tyler, please!

JANET
The State is not God. It hasn't the
right to penalize people for an
accident of birth. It hasn't the
right to make ugliness a crime—

 

DOCTOR
(shouting)
Miss Tyler, I must ask you to stop
this kind of talk immediately! 59w,
Miss Tyler, now!

The CAMERA MOVES BACK over to a SHOT OF JANET, who gets out
of bed and stands there for a moment motionless with her
head down, then very slowly, a hand out in front of her, she
moves across the room over to a window. She touches it, then
puts her bandaged Cheek against it.

CUT TO:

22. Reverse angle looking at her through the glass One hand
moves down the pane until it reaches the open section at the
bottom. She moves her hand back and forth.

JZNET

(softly)
I feel the night out there. I feel
the air. I can smell the flowers.

(she turns slowly to

face the doctor.

Both hands go up to

touch the bandage,

in a very small,

still voice)
Please take this off me. Please take
this off me.

(then screaming)
Take this 9:: me!

She starts to clutch and scrabble at the bandage, screaming
as she does so.

ABRUPT CUT TO:
23. INT. CORRIDOR ROOM INDICATOR ON WALL OVER RECEPTION DESK

A light "307" flashes over and over again. In the b.g. we
hear Janet's screaming voice pleading for the removal of the
bandage. The nurse passes the camera hurriedly. CAMERA PANS
AROUND SO THAT IT IS LOOKING at her as she races down the
corridor toward Janet's room.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

1.1..

24. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM AS SEEN THROUGH THE WINDOW FROM
OUTSIDE

The doctor is holding a fighting, squirming Janet as the
nurse barges in, takes her other arm and the two of them
move her back over to the bed. The scene is played in
pantomime and finally Janet quiets down. We then see the
nurse walk back over to the door and exit.

CUT TO:
25. INT. CORRIDOR MED. SHOT RECEPTION NURSE

Reading a magazine that covers up her face. Janet‘s nurse
walks in front of camera so that we see most of her back and
part of the nurse sitting behind the magazine.

JANET'S NURSE
The doctor's decided to remove the
bandages in 307. He wants to have
the anesthetist stand by.

26. Different angle the reception nurse She turns just at
the moment of the CAMERA CUT so that we actually don't see
her face.

NURSE TWO
Of course, it's not for me to say,
but I think they spend an awful lot
of time and trouble on some of these
face oases — these throwbacks: Why
not ship them out in the beginning?

She reaches for her magazine again and starts to turn in her
chair, at which point

THE CAMERA AGAIN CUTS TO:
27. SHOT OF HER BACK
Looking over her shoulder.
JhNET'S NURSE
Is that what you'd want? If it were
you?
The second nurse flicks the intercom impatiently.
NURSE TWO
Anesthesia, please. Wanted for 307.
Yes. She may get violent.
FADE TO BLACK-—END ACT ONE—-ACT TWO*—FADE ON:
28. INT. CORRIDOR RECEPTION DESK [NIGHT]

A nurse and an orderly lounge around, backs to camera. The
orderly looks at his watch, then across at a large television

.LL-

set perched on the far end of the counter which fronts the
reception desk.

ORDERLY
Leader‘s speaking tonight. Goes on
in just a few minutes.

He rises, flicks on the set, then lights a cigarette.

29. Top hat shot the match As it goes into the ashtray.
Directly across on a direct line is the front of the
television set which shows an extremely long shot of a desk
with an official seal behind it. A man sits behind it, too
far off to distinguish clearly beyond a general outline. An
off—camera voice announces portentously.

ANNOUNCER
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our
Leader.

There is cheering and offstage applause, and we now hear the
stentorian tones of the gentleman just announced.

LEADER'S VOICE
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight I shall talk to you about
glorious conformity...about the
delight and the ultimate pleasure of
our unified society. You recall, of
course, that directionless,
unproductive, over-sentimentalized
era of man's history when it was
assumed that dissent was some kind
of natural and healthy adjunct to
society. We also recall that during
this period of time there was a
strange over—sentimentalized concept
that it mattered not that people
were different, that ideas were at
variance with one another, that a
world could exist in some kind of
crazy, patchwork kind of makeup,
with foreign elements glued together
in a crazy quilt. We realize, of
course, now, that...

His voice continues underneath as the CAMERA MOVES AWAY from
him and SHOOTS DOWN THE HALL. The LEADER'S VOICE continues
through the bandage—removal scene.
30. Different angle the door of Janet's room

DISSOLVE TO:
31. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

Janet now sits in a chair in the center of the room. A single
overhead light has been turned on so that she alone is

J.J-

illuminated almost as if by a spotlight. There's a low murmur
of voices underneath as other shadowy figures in the room
walk back and forth in front of her, their shadows playing
briefly on her bandaged face as they move. Behind this scene,
intermittently, we can hear the voice of the Leader on the
television set outside. Then the voices of the doctor and

the people in the room die off. The doctor's body steps in
front of the camera. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a SHOT OF HIS RIGHT
HAND. It holds a scissors.

DOCTOR
Now I have to ask you once again,
Miss Tyler. I must insist that you
promise to remain rational. No
tantrums. No temperament. And no
violence. You understand?

Janet nods.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Now I'll tell you precisely what I'm
going to do. I'm going to cut the
bandage at a point on the left side
of your head. I'll start to unwind
the bandage very gradually. The
process has to be slow so that you
can become accustomed to the light.
As you know, the injections may have
had an effect on your vision. Now as
I unwrap, I want you to keep your
eyes open and I want you to describe
to me the different shading of light
as you perceive it as each layer of
bandage comes off.

JANET
(softly)
All right.

32. Different angle profile shot Janet We see the doctor's
body from the neck down, the scissors now held in front of
him.

DOCTOR
Now if you make any movement or if
you start getting emotional on us,
Miss Tyler, I'm going to have to
have the nurses hold you down and
have the anesthetist put you under
sedation. Is that understood?

JANET
(falteringly)
I promise...I won't.

DOCTOR
All right then.

J_‘l-

The scissors come out in front of him and move toward the
camera. From this angle they are disproportionately large
and almost fill the screen. We see them perform some movement
and the bandages start to move in sections across the screen
as if being unwound from a head.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Do you see any light new, Miss Tyler?

JANET
Just a little. It looks...it looks
gray.

DOCTOR

All right now, just be very quiet.
Again bandage swirls across the screen and then stops.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Now, Miss Tyler?

JANET
Much brighter. Very bright.

DOCTOR
Look up toward the light.

CUT TO:

33. Angle shot looking up toward light A diffuse sun as seen
through layers of bandage.

34. Reverse angle over the doctor's shoulder looking down
toward Janet's face As once again he starts to unwrap bandage.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
How about now, Miss Tyler?

JANET
It's bright. It's very bright.

DOCTOR
Good.
(he continues to unwrap
then stops)
I‘m at the last layer now, Miss Tyler.

Janet's face goes up.

JANET
I can...I can just distinguish your
outline. Just vaguely...but I can
see you.

DOCTOR
Now I‘m going to remove the last
bandage, Miss Tyler. Now do you want
a mirror?

.de
There's a silence.

JANET
No. No, thank you. No mirror.

Again she looks up as if trying to scan the faces of the
others in the room.

35. Pan shot past the faces Of the anesthetist, and two nurses
in the shadows as they watch motionlessly and tensely.

36. Different angle Janet As seen from the back of her head.
The doctor once again reaches for the last of the bandages.

DOCTOR
Now I'm going to remove the last
bandage, Miss Tyler. And I want you
to remember this please. Miss Tyler?
Are you listening?

JANET
Yes, I'm listening.

DOCTOR
We have done all we could. If we
were successful - all well and good.
There are no problems. If, however,
this final treatment has not achieved
the desired results, keep in mind
that you can still live a long and
fruitful life among people of your
own kind. As soon as we discover
these results, we'll either release
you...or...

He pauses for a moment.

37. Another pan shot past the shadowy faces Of the other
people in the room, winding up on a SHOT OF JANET’S thinly
bandaged face through which we can now see the outline of
her features, eyes, nose, mouth, but no definitive portrait
of a face.

JANET
Doctor?

DOCTOR
YES.

JINET

If I'm still...if I'm still terribly
ugly, is there any other alternative?
Could I...could I be put away?

DOCTOR
Under certain circumstances, Miss
Tyler...the State does provide for
(MORE)

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
extermination of undesirables. There
are many factors to be considered,
though, that bear on the decision.
Under the circumstances, considering
your age...your general physical
condition...I doubt very much if we
could permit anything but your
transfer to a communal group of people
with your...your disability.

JANET
You‘ll make me go then?

DOCTOR
That will probably be the case. All
right, Miss Tyler. Remain very quiet
please. Keep your eyes open.

38. Different angle from behind the doctor As he reaches
forward and starts to unwind the last bandage. The first
strip of bandage comes off the top of her forehead, another
layer revealing her forehead, another layer uncovering just
the upper part of her eyebrows and eyes.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
All right, Miss Tyler. Now here comes
the last of it. I wish you every
good luck!

Again he reaches over and starts to unwind as we

CUT TO:

39. Shadowy faces of the other people in the room

There‘s a moment‘s absolute silence, then one of the nurses
lets out a gasp. Another involuntarily throws a hand and arm
across her face to blot out what is obviously an incredible
spectacle.

40. Flash close shot doctor's hand As he drops the scissors
and they land on the floor. He then steps back into the
shadows to stand close to the others.

DOCTOR‘S VOICE
No change! No change at all!

41. Closeup Janet She raises her head. If she is not
startlingly beautiful, we have missed our point entirely.

42. Different angle from behind Janet

As she slowly rises. Her hands come up from her side to touch
her face, then remain there as her head bends over and she
buries her face in her hands. In the silence we hear one
rasping sob that is finally and painfully controlled. Then
she looks up, scanning the faces that confront her, then

.Llo

suddenly she breaks away and races toward the door. The doctor
hurriedly and expertly steps in front of her way and grabs
her.

DOCTOR
(curtly to the other man in the room)
Needle, please. I was afraid of this.
(then to the nurse)
Turn on the lights!

The shadowy form of the nurse moves over to the light switch.
43. Close shot her hand As she turns on the switch.

44.—47. Abrupt flash closeups of the two nurses, the
anesthetist, and then the doctor Each face is more grotesque
than the other. Noses, eyes, mouths, ears, everything, almost
as if they were cartoons; almost as if they were caricature
drawings come to life.

48. Med. close shot the anesthetist A syringe in his hand,
as he walks slowly toward the struggling girl whose face is
buried against the doctor. He holds up the needle and at
this moment Janet breaks free, opens the door wildly and
races out into the corridor.

49. Long shot as she races down the corridor Past amazed
nurses and doctors, each of whom has the same odd ugliness
of those we have already seen.

50. Close shot door of Janet's room As the doctor barges
out.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
(shouts)
Stop that patient! Stop her!

51.-53. Series of shots of Janet As she races down empty
corridors.

54. close shot elevator operator He opens the doors to the
elevator just as Janet passes. He, like all the others, is a
cartoon—looking character.

55. Close shot doctor Coming out of operating room, removing
his mask just as Janet runs by him. His face is like that of
the elevator operator.

(The following covers Janet's running through the corridor.)

LEADER'S VOICE
I say to you now...I say to you now
that there is no such thing as a
permissive society, because such a
society cannot exist!

(MORE)

LEADER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
They will scream at you and rant and
rave and conjure up some dead and
decadent picture of an ancient time
when they said that all men are
created equal! But to them equality
was an equality of opportunity, an
equality of status, an equality of
aspiration! And then, in what must
surely be the pinnacle of insanity,
the absolute in inconsistency, they
would have had us believe that this
equality did not apply to form, to
creed. They permitted a polyglot,
accident-bred, mongrel—like mass of
diversification to blanket the earth,
to infiltrate and weaken!

(now he shrieks)
Well, we know now that there must be
a single purpose! A single norm! A
single approach! A single entity of
peoples! A single virtue! A single
morality! A_single frame of reference!
A single philosophy of government!
(shrieking again)

We cannot permit...we must not permit
the encroaching sentimentality of a
past age to weaken our resolve. We
must cut out all that is different
like a cancerous growth:

 

56. Running shot Janet As she races down the corridor.

57.-59. Different angles television screens As she runs by
them. Each with a different angle of the face of the Leader
as he continues to speak, his voice droning, unintelligible,
but persistent and gradually taking on a build of excitement.

60. Different angle Janet As she stops in the middle of an
empty hall and looks left, right, in front and then back.

CUT TO:
61.—63. Interspersed shots of the television screen

As each shot shows it in larger and larger perspective. The
face of the Leader is incredibly ugly as it shouts down at
her.

64. Zoom in to close shot Janet‘s back As her hands go to
the sides of her head, as if trying to shut out the noises.

65. Long angle shot looking down As she races down the last
corridor and turns a corner then stops dead. WHIP PAN UP TO
GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN. The Leader's face fills it up
entirely, screaming, ranting, contorting.

J.J-

66. Close shot Janet's hand As she instinctively reaches for
an ashtray near a bench which is against one wall.

67. DIFFERENT ANGLE
As she picks it up and flings it across the corridor.

68. Extremely tight close shot television screen The ashtray
hits the face of the Leader head on and splinters the set,
and from the broken, smoking remnant of the machine, we hear
the voice of the Leader.

LEADER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
It is essential in this society that
we not only have a norm, but that we
conform to that norm. Differences
weaken us. Variations destroy us. An
incredible permissiveness to deviation
from this norm is what has ended
nations and brought them to their
knees. Conformity we must worship
and hold sacred. Conformity is the
key to survival.

The voice persists as we
CUT TO:

69. Different angle Janet As she races down the corridor
past the screen.

70. Close shot double doors Unlabled, as Janet runs in and
smashes through them.

71. INT. ROOM MED. SHOT

Janet bursts in and recoils in shock and horror at something
she sees o.s. She shrieks and slides slowly down to the ground
in a huddled heap and begins to cry. The CAMERA MOVES DOWN.
The legs and feet of whatever monstrosity she has seen move
into f.g. Janet is terrified. Then the doctor enters from
another direction and bends down to her soothingly.

DOCTOR
Don't be afraid, Miss Tyler. This is
a representative of the group you're
to live with. Oddly enough, you've
come right to him. Come on now — he
won't hurt you.

He lifts the terrified girl to her feet.
72. CLOSEUP JANET

Forces herself to look at the newcomer, her face full of
revulsion.

LU.

73. Full shot Walter Smith steps into the light. We see a
youthful, tremendously attractive young man, dressed plainly
in simple trousers and shirt.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)
This is Mr. Smith, Janet. Walter
Smith. He's in charge of the Village
group in the north. He'll take you
there tonight. You can live among
your own kind now.

74. Different angle Smith As he walks over to Janet. We're
looking across her back and up into Smith's face. In addition
to being attractive, it's a gentle face, a compassionate
face, an infinitely kind face. He smiles, his voice is gentle
and soft.

SMITH
Miss Tyler?

The girl's head is raised.

SMITH (CONT'D)
We have a lovely village and wonderful
people. I think you'll like it where
I'm going to take you. You'll be
with your own kind, and after a little
while — you‘d be amazed how little a
while — you'll feel a sense of great
belonging. You'll feel a sense of
being loved. And you will be loved,
Miss Tyler.

The girl remains motionless now. Smith looks up and gestures
with his head.

75. Different angle the room As the doctor leaves and shuts
the door behind him.

76. CLOSE SHOT SMITH

SMITH (CONT'D)
Miss Tyler? Would you get your things
now? We can leave any time.

The CAMERA STARTS A VERY, VERY SLOW ARC until finally it is
shooting directly into the face of Janet Tyler. She's like a
beautiful living portrait. A face carved into the mold of
all things woman. Gentle, beautiful, feminine, and young.

JANET
Mr. Smith?

SMITH
Yes?

L;-

JANET
Why...why are some of us born so
ugly?

SMITH

(smiles sadly)
I don't know, Miss Tyler. I really
don't know.

(a pause)
But do you know something? It doesn't
really matter. There's an old
saying...a very, very old saying.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
When we leave here...when we go to
the village...keep that in mind.
Try, Miss Tyler. Say it over and
over in your mind. Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder.

(a pause as he takes

her hand)
Come on, now. We‘ll get your things
and we'll leave.

The two of them walk to the double doors. He opens them for
her and they walk out into the corridor, a vast empty
passageway that stretches out almost to infinity. The CAMERA
REMAINS STATIONARY as they walk away from it down the
corridor.

SERLING'S VOICE

Now the questions that come to mind:
Where is this place and when is it?
What kind of world, where ugliness
is the norm and beauty the deviation
from that norm? You want an answer?
The answer is...it doesn't make any
difference. Because the old saying
happens to be true. Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder. In this year or
a hundred years hence.

(a pause)
On this planet...or wherever there
is human life, perhaps out amongst
the stars.

(a pause)
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Lesson to be learned...in The Twilight
Zone.

 

FADE TO BLACK.
