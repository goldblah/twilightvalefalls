THE TWILIGHT ZONE
Episode 107: "THE LONELY"
Written by
Rod Serling

ACT ONE
EXT. SKY [NIGHT]
Shot of the sky... the various nebulae and planet bodies
stand out in sharp, sparkling relief. As the CAMERA begins
a SLOW PAN across the Heavens -NARRATOR'S VOICE (O.S.)
There is a fifth dimension beyond that
which is known to man. It is a dimension as
vast as space and timeless as infinity. It
is the middle ground between light and
shadow -- between science and superstition,
and it lies between the pit of man's fears
and the summit of his knowledge. This is
the dimension of imagination. It is an area
which we call The Twilight Zone.
The CAMERA has begun to PAN DOWN until it passes the
horizon and is flush on the OPENING SHOT.
We are now looking at an empty patch of desert, an arid,
dull nondescript piece of land, its monotony broken only by
an occasional scrubby, dying cactus, and a few sand dunes
that shift nervously and sporadically in a wind that
provides the only motion and the only sound to an otherwise
stagnant scene. The CAMERA PANS LEFT very slowly until it
is on a -LONG SHOT A COTTAGE
That sits alone in the desert. This is a ramshackle, tworoom affair made of corrugated steel, driftwood and other
nondescript material. Alongside is a beat-up vintage 1930's
sedan. Beyond and behind this is a tiny tool shed that
houses a small generator. A limp wire extends from the shed
to the shack.
NARRATOR'S VOICE
(over the pan)
Witness, if you will, a dungeon, made out
of mountains, salt flats, and sand that
stretch to infinity. The dungeon has an
inmate, James A. Corry. And this is his
residence, a metal shack.
(MORE)

NARRATOR'S VOICE (CONT'D)
An old touring car that squats in the sun
and goes nowhere -- for there is nowhere to
go.
At this point we see Corry come out of the house. He's
dressed in jeans and a threadbare shirt. He looks up toward
the pale sky and the strange, sick, white gleam of the sun,
shades his eyes, walks over toward the car and stops, looks
at it, touches it with his hand, then leans against it and
stares once again toward the horizon.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
Across the car looking at Corry. He's a man in his early
forties of medium height, perhaps a little more muscular
than most men. His face was once a strong face; it is no
longer. There is no will left and no resolve. What we see
on it now is resignation; a sense of dull, pervading
hopelessness. He rather aimlessly opens the car door and
leaving it open, slides in to sit in the driver's seat and
look out the front windshield. The CAMERA MOVES AROUND so
that it's shooting through the front windshield toward him.
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
As he gets out of the car and stares across toward the
horizon.
NARRATOR'S VOICE
For the record let it be known that James
A. Corry is a convicted criminal placed in
solitary confinement. Confinement in this
case stretches as far as the eye can see,
because this particular dungeon is on an
asteroid nine million miles from the Earth.
The CAMERA PANS slowly up toward the sky to where we see a
shot of the earth.
NARRATOR'S VOICE
Now witness, if you will, a man's mind and
body shriveling in the sun, a man dying of
loneliness.

MED. SHOT CORRY
Corry, shoulders slumped walking in a kind of draggy,
aimless shuffle, goes back toward the shack and walks
inside.
CUT TO:
INT. SHACK FULL SHOT THE ROOM
The inside, like the exterior, is makeshift and looks
temporary. The furniture is made out of packing cases.
There's an aged wind-up Victrola, an icebox. The bed is
disheveled and dirty. He walks over to a small rickety
table, takes out a dog-eared ledger, opens it and rifles
through the pages slowly and rather aimlessly. Then he
takes a pencil, sits down, and starts to write. The CAMERA
MOVES IN very slowly as he voices aloud that which he is
writing.
CORRY'S VOICE
Entry, fifteenth day, sixth month... the
year four. And all the days and the months
and the years the same.
(a pause. Now he sits as he
writes)
There'll be a supply ship coming in soon. I
think. They're either due or overdue, and I
hope it's Allenby's ship because he's a
decent man and he brings things for me.
(he stops writing for a
moment, looks down at the
ledger, then continues to
write)
Like he brought in the parts to that
antique automobile. I was a year putting
that thing together -- such as it is. A
whole year putting an old car together.
(a pause)
But thank God for that car and for the
hours it used up and the days and the
weeks. I can look at it out there and I
know it's real and reality is what I need.
Because what is there left that I can
believe in? The desert and the wind? The
silence?
(MORE)

CORRY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Or myself -- can I believe in myself
anymore?
(another pause)
Disjointed thought... a little crazy... but
maybe I'll become like that car. Inanimate.
Just an item sitting in the sand -- and
then would I feel loneliness? Would I feel
misery? I wonder...
He slowly lets the pencil drop out of his fingers, looks
down at the book. His eyes close, then he slumps forward
burying his face in his arms, leaning against the table.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHACK [DAY]
Through the window we can see Corry sleeping, still by the
table. There's the distant roaring sound of engines, a
flash of light that shines against the side of the shack
and enters the window. We see Corry start, and rise and
race to the door, flinging it open, peering out over the
landscape.
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT LONG SHOT A GROUP OF THREE MEN
Dressed in simple uniforms not unlike pilots of today. The
CAMERA STAYS directly on them as they approach. Into the
frame from behind the camera comes Corry, who is racing out
to meet them. His fingers clench and unclench at his side.
He takes a few fast stumbling steps toward them, then
thinking better of it stops and then, giving in again, runs
toward them again.
CLOSE SHOT
As they suddenly meet a few feet from one another. The head
of the space group stops. This is Allenby, a man in his
fifties. He nods a little curtly.
ALLENBY
How are you, Corry?

CORRY
All right.
There's a silence now. Adams, one of the other two
spacemen, looks around.
ADAMS
Quite a place you got here, Corry.
CORRY
I'm so glad you like it.
ADAMS
I didn't say I liked it. I think it stinks.
CORRY
You don't have to live here now, do you?
ADAMS
No, but I've got to come back here four
times a year. And that's eight months out
of twelve, Corry, away from earth.
Sometimes my kids don't even recognize me
when I come home.
CORRY
(very simply)
I'm sorry.
ADAMS
(with a look)
I'll bet you are! But you've got it made,
don't you. Corry? Makes for simple living,
doesn't it?
(he bends down and picks up
a handful of sand)
This is Corry's kingdom.
(he lets the sand run
through his fingers)
Right here. Six thousand miles north to
south. Four thousand miles east to west -and all of its just like this!
The CAMERA is on Corry's face now. He wets his lips. He
wants to say something with desperate urgency. Allenby sees
the look, looks away a little uncomfortably for a moment.

ALLENBY
We've only got a fifteen-minute layover,
Corry.
Corry wets his lips and tries to keep the supplication out
of his voice.
CORRY
Nobody's checking your schedule out here.
Why don't we have a game of cards or
something?
ALLENBY
(shakes his head)
I'm sorry, Corry. This isn't an arbitrary
decision. If we delay our time of departure
any more than fifteen minutes, that places
us in a different orbital position. We'd
never make it back to earth. We'd have to
stay here at least fourteen days before
this place was in position again.
CORRY
So, fourteen days? Why not have us a ball?
I've got some beer I've saved. We could
play some cards, tell me what's going on
back there -ALLENBY
(with an embarrassed look at
the others)
I wish we could Corry, but like I said -we've only got fifteen minutes...
CORRY
(his voice rising and
getting shaky as if losing
control)
Well... well what's a few lousy days to
you? Couple of card games.
(he nods toward the others)
How about you guys? You think I'll murder
you or something over a bad hand?

ALLENBY
(quietly and firmly)
I'm sorry, Corry.
(he starts to take Corry's
arm)
Let's go to the shack -Corry flings off his arm, not in anger, but in desperation.
CORRY
All right. Two minutes are gone now. You've
got thirteen minutes left. I wouldn't want
to foul up your schedule, Allenby. Not for
a...
(he looks away)
Not for a lousy game of cards. Not for a
few bottles of crummy beer.
Then he looks up slowly, turns to lock eyes with Allenby.
He seems to catch his breath for a moment.
CORRY
Allenby... what about the pardon?
ADAMS
(squinting up toward the
sky, his voice very matter
of fact)
You're out of luck, Corry. Sentence reads
fifty years and they're not even reviewing
cases of homicide. You've been here four
now. That makes forty-six to go, so get
comfortable, dad huh?
He laughs until his eyes reach Allenby's. Allenby stares at
him, then wets his lips and looks away. Adams's laugh dies
out.
TRACK SHOT
As the three men head toward the shack. Corry's eyes are
down, staring at the sand where his feet make crunchy
sounds as they sink down over the crust of the top layer.
Allenby, alongside of him as they walk, looks at him
intermittently.

DIFFERENT ANGLE
As they reach a small knoll. Over their shoulder we see the
shack and car sitting here in mute, ugly loneliness. Corry
stops instinctively to stare at them. Allenby touches his
arm compassionately with an instinctive gentleness.
ALLENBY
(quietly)
I'm sorry, Corry. Unfortunately, we don't
make the rules. All we do is deliver your
supplies and pass on information. I told
you last time there's been a lot of
pressure back home about this kind of
punishment. There are a whole lot of people
who think it is unnecessarily cruel. Well
who knows what the next couple of years
will bring? They may change their minds,
alter the law, imprison you on earth like
the old days.
CORRY
(turns to stare intently
into the older man's face)
Allenby, I have to tell you something.
Every morning... every morning when I get
up I tell myself that this is my last day
of sanity. I won't be able to live another
day of loneliness. Not another day, and by
noon when I can't keep my fingers still and
the inside of my mouth feels like gun
powder and burnt copper and deep inside my
gut I've got an ache that won't go away and
seems to be crawling all over the inside of
my body, prickling at me, tearing little
chunks out of me -- and then I think I've
got to hold out for another day, just
another day.
(then he turns to stare down
at the shack)
But I can't keep doing that day after day
for the next forty-six years. I'll lose my
mind, Allenby.

ADAMS
You're breakin' my heart -Corry whirls around to stare at him. His features contort.
There's an animal-like growl that shouts out deep from his
throat and suddenly, losing all control he lunges at Adams,
hitting him twice, crunching, desperate blows that smash
against Adams's face and propel him backwards to sprawl
face- first in the sand. Allenby and the other officer grab
Corry's arms.
ALLENBY
(shouting)
Easy, Corry, easy!
Gradually Corry lets his body relax, going the route from a
trembling, shaking ague to a heavy, tired motionlessness.
MED. CLOSE SHOT ADAMS
As he rises from the sand, gingerly touches the bruise on
his face.
ADAMS
I wouldn't worry about going off my rocker,
Corry. It's already happened. Stir crazy,
they used to call it. Well, that's what you
are now. Stir crazy.
ALLENBY
(taking a step toward him to
keep him back)
Back off, Adams. You and Carstairs go back
and get the supplies. Bring them over to
the shack.
ADAMS
(bridling)
Mr. Corry has a broken leg or something?
He points to Corry.
ALLENBY
Go ahead, do as I tell you. And the big
crate with the red tag -- handle that one
(MORE)

ALLENBY (CONT'D)
gently.
CARSTAIRS
How about the use of his buggy there? Some
of the stuff's heavy.
CORRY
(as if shaken out of a dream
softly)
It isn't running today.
ADAMS
(laughs)
It isn't running today! What's the matter,
Corry -- use it too much, do you?
(to Carstairs)
You know, there's so many places a guy can
go out here. There's the country club over
the mound there and the seashore over that
way, and the drive-in theater, that's
someplace around here, isn't it, Corry?
ALLENBY
Knock it off, Adams, and go get the stuff.
Adams and Carstairs turn with another look toward Corry and
start back across the desert. Allenby takes Corry's arm and
the two men walk toward the shack.
LONG SHOT CORRY AND ALLENBY
As they walk past the car and the shed and into the shack.
INT. SHACK FULL SHOT THE ROOM
Corry goes over to sit on the bed to stare numbly across
the room at nothing. Allenby crosses over to the icebox,
takes out a jug of water, looks around the room and then
over to Corry.
ALLENBY
Glasses?

CORRY
(motions)
Paper Cups. On the shelf there.
Allenby unscrews the jar and sniffs, makes a face, then
pours some water into a cup, takes it in a quick gulp.
ALLENBY
We've got some fresh on board. They'll be
bringing it over.
Corry nods numbly. Allenby pulls up a chair so that he's
sitting directly opposite Corry.
ALLENBY
Brought you some magazines, too. Strictly
on my own.
CORRY
(nods)
Thanks.
ALLENBY
And some old vintage movies. Sciencefiction stuff. You'll get a kick out of it.
CORRY
(nods, looks up unsmiling)
I'm sure I will.
Allenby bites his lip and looks at Corry for a long, silent
moment, then he rises and crosses to the window.
ALLENBY
I brought you something else, Corry. It
would mean my job if they suspected.
(then he turns toward Corry)
It would be my neck if they found out for
sure.
CORRY
Look, Allenby, I don't want gifts now. I
don't want tidbits. It makes me feel like
an animal in a cage and there's a nice old
lady out there who wants to throw peanuts
at me.
(MORE)

(CONT'D)
(he suddenly lashes out and
grabs Allenby)
A pardon, Allenby, that's the only gift I
want. I'm not a murderer, I killed in selfdefense. A lot of people believe me and it
happens to be the truth. I killed in selfdefense -ALLENBY
(gently takes Corry's hands
off of him)
I know, Corry. I know all about it.
(he retraces his steps back
over the chair and sits
down)
I doubt if it'll be much consolation to
you, but it's not easy handling this kind
of assignment. Stopping here four times a
year and having to look at a man's agony.
CORRY
You're quite right. That's precious little
consolation.
There's a long, long silence. Allenby rises.
ALLENBY
Well, I can't bring you freedom, Corry. All
I can do... all I can do is to try to bring
you things to help keep your sanity.
(a pause)
Something... anything so you can fight
loneliness.
He looks across the room and out the window.
LONG SHOT THROUGH THE WINDOW
Adams and Carstairs are both lugging a small metal cart
loaded down with crates and supplies. They enter the area
of the shack to bring the cart up close to the front door.
The two of them take a heavy crate off the top of the pile,
a red tag fluttering from one end. They lay it down in the
sand.

CARSTAIRS
(calls)
You want this big crate opened up, Captain?
MED. CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY
ALLENBY
(calls out)
Not yet. Stay out there. I'll be right out.
TWO SHOT CORRY AND ALLENBY
CORRY
I'll bite, Captain. What's the present?
(he looks briefly through
the window)
What is it?
He rises, goes over to the window to stare out at the long,
rectangular box.
MED. LONG SHOT THROUGH THE WINDOW
Of the box as it lies in the sand.
MED. CLOSE SHOT CORRY
As he turns back toward the room.
CORRY
If it's a twenty-year supply of puzzles,
I'll have to decline with thanks. I don't
need any puzzles, Allenby. If I want to try
to probe any mysteries -- I can look in the
mirror and try to figure out my own.
ALLENBY
(crosses over to the door,
opens it, turns back to
Corry)
We've got to go now. We'll be back in three
months.
(a pause)
Are you listening to me, Corry? This is
important.
Corry stares at him.

ALLENBY
When you open up the crate there's nothing
you need do. The... item has been vacuumpacked. It needs no activator of any kind.
The air will do that. There'll be a booklet
inside, too, that can answer any of your
questions.
CORRY
You're mysterious as hell.
ALLENBY
I don't mean to be. It's just like I told
you, though -- I'm risking a lot to have
brought this here.
(he points to the door)
They don't know what it is I brought. I'd
appreciate your waiting until we get out of
sight.
CORRY
(unemotionally)
All right. Have a good trip back... Give my
regards to...
(he wets his lips)
...to Broadway. And every place else while
you're at it.
ALLENBY
Sure, Corry. I'll see you.
He goes out the door, motions to the other two men. They
start to follow him.
CUT TO:
MED. CLOSE SHOT CORRY
Standing at the door.
CORRY
Allenby!
CUT TO:
REVERSE ANGLE ALLENBY AND THE OTHER TWO CORRY'S P.O.V.
The three men pause to look toward the shack. In the

foreground in front of them we see the long crate lying all
by itself in the sand.
CUT TO:
MED. CLOSE SHOT CORRY
He walks down the step and stands near the box, points to
it.
CORRY
I don't much care what it is. For the
thought, Allenby, for the... for the
decency of it... I thank you.
MED. SHOT ALLENBY
ALLENBY
You're quite welcome, Corry.
He turns and the other two follow him.
LONG ANGLE SHOT
Looking down at them as they slowly tramp across the sand
and disappear over the line of dunes.
MED. CLOSE SHOT CORRY
He watches them go, shading his eyes again at the sun, then
very slowly he looks down at the box. He stares at it for a
long moment, then he kneels down to feel its sides and
finally finds the two release catches. His hands go out to
touch them simultaneously. He pushes them, and very slowly
the top of the box opens.
TIGHT CLOSE ANGLE SHOT
Looking up as from inside the box toward Corry's face as he
stares into it. His eyes suddenly widen with astonishment.
CUT ABRUPTLY TO:
MED. CLOSE SHOT INSERT SECTION OF A SPACE CRAFT
What we are seeing is just part of a hatch and a metal
ladder. Carstairs is just clambering up them to disappear
inside this ship. Adams starts to follow him. He pauses

halfway up to look toward Allenby, who in turn is staring
off into the distance.
ADAMS
Captain -- just man to man, huh?
ALLENBY
What?
ADAMS
What did you bring him? What was in the
box?
MED. CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY
As he slowly scratches the beard stubble of
his square jaw.
ALLENBY
(very softly as if to no one
in particular)
I'm not sure really. Maybe just an illusion
-- or maybe salvation.
Then he turns, motions Adams up the ladder, and then
follows him up.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE SHACK
The top of the box has been opened and as the CAMERA PANS
over it toward the shack we see that it is empty. The
CAMERA continues to PAN over to the shack.
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
INT. SHACK
Corry stands at the far end of the room staring off beyond
the camera. He has a book in his hand which he suddenly
seems to remember. He looks down at it, stares at the cover
for a long moment, then opens it with both his hands. He
studies it perplexed for a long moment; then he looks up
again. Then he looks down at the book again and slowly he
reads aloud.

CORRY
You are now the proud owner of a robot
built in the form of a woman. To all intent
and purpose this creature is a woman.
Physiologically and psychologically she is
a human being with a set of emotions, a
memory track, the ability to reason, to
think, and to speak. She is beyond illness
and under normal circumstances should have
a life span similar to that of a comparable
human being. Her name is Alicia.
Very slowly Corry's head rises. SLOW PAN SHOT ACROSS the
room to a shot of Alicia who sits in a chair looking back
at him. While she looks human, there is something too
immobile, too emotionless about her features. There is a
deadness to the eyes when they look back at him, showing
neither resignation nor interest and only bare awareness.
She's dressed in a simple loose, flowing garment that
neither adds to nor detracts from her femininity. Corry
takes a few hesitant steps toward her, his eyes wide, a
fright working its way out. His mouth moves but nothing
comes.
CLOSE SHOT THE GIRL
ALICIA
That's my name -- Alicia. What's yours?
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
He stops dead in his tracks and suddenly he looks
horrified, sick with distaste. He shakes his head from side
to side and backs away.
CORRY
(in a very low voice)
Get out of here.
(now a shout)
Get out of here! I don't want any machine
in here! Go on, get out of here!
With an effort he grabs the girl and propels her out the
door and slams it behind her. Then he leans against the
door, eyes closed, breathing heavily and gradually his
composure comes back. He takes a few steps back toward the
center of the room. In the process he looks toward the

window.
LONG SHOT THROUGH THE WINDOW
The girl stands there in the yard staring at him.
FADE TO BLACK:
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE ON:
EXT. DESERT CORRY'S SHACK IN FOREGROUND
INT. SHACK
Corry is in the process of putting up a shelf. He stands on
a small aluminum ladder, pounding with hammer and nails.
The sweat pours down his face. He tests the shelf, then
gets down off the ladder, picks up a towel and wipes his
face, suddenly looks down at his feet.
CLOSE SHOT BUCKET OF WATER
CAMERA PULLS BACK for shot of Alicia standing there.
CORRY
Well?
ALICIA
I brought you some water. Where shall I put
it?
CORRY
Just leave it there and get out.
ALICIA
It will get warm just sitting there.
CORRY
(takes a glass, dips it in
the water)
You'd know, huh?
He takes a drink.
ALICIA
I can feel thirst.
Corry wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and looks
at her intensely.
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
As he stares at her. The same look of abhorrence as if
clinically examining some foreign object.

CLOSE SHOT THE GIRL
Her eyes go down and she turns away.
TWO SHOT
CORRY
What else can you feel?
ALICIA
I don't understand -CORRY
I suppose you can feel heat and cold? How
about pain? Can you feel pain?
ALICIA
(nods softly)
That too.
Corry takes a step over toward her, looking down at her.
CORRY
How? How can you? You're a machine, aren't
you?
ALICIA
(whispering)
Yes.
CORRY
Of course you are. So why didn't they build
you to look like a machine? Why aren't you
made out of metal with nuts and bolts
sticking out of you? With wires and
electrodes and things like that?
(his face contorts now and
his voice rises)
Why do they turn you into a lie? Why do
they cover you with what looks like flesh?
Why do they give you a face? A face that if
I look at long enough makes me think...
makes me believe that...
His hands grab her shoulders and go up past her neck to cup
her face in a hard, painful grasp. Alicia closes her eyes
against the pain.

ALICIA
Corry -He releases her, strides past her and out the door.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE SHACK
Corry stands halfway to the car, his back to the shack.
CORRY
You mock me, you know that? When you look
at me. When you talk to me -- I'm being
mocked.
ALICIA
I'm sorry.
(then she slowly reaches up,
feels of her neck and
shoulders)
You hurt me, Corry.
CORRY
(turns to her, walks over
very close to her)
Hurt you? How could I hurt you?
(he grabs her again)
This isn't flesh. There aren't any nerves
under there. There aren't any tendons or
muscles.
He suddenly pushes her bodily away.
CUT TO:
FLASH SHOT
As she sprawls head first into the sand.
TWO SHOT
Then in the same fury that knows neither logic nor
understanding, he searches wildly around and then picks up
a shovel. He holds it by the handle and brandishes it up
high. He shouts at her.

CORRY
You know what you are? You're like that
broken-down heap I've got sitting in the
yard. You're a hunk of metal with arms and
legs instead of wheels. But that heap
doesn't mock me like you do. It doesn't
look at me with make-believe eyes and talk
to me with a make-believe voice.
(he takes a step toward her,
now the shovel up high)
Well listen you... listen machine, I'm sick
at being mocked by a ghost. By a memory of
women. And that's all you are. You're a
reminder to me that I'm so lonely I'm about
to lose my mind.
And now his face is completely contorted, wild-eyed. He
raises the shovel and is about to bring it down on her.
ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN AT HER
She looks up at him and then her eyes close and tears
appear. Then when she opens her eyes again we look at her
as from a new and fresh perspective. The face is no longer
inanimate, no longer immobile. It now has depth, emotion.
It is filled with the nuances and mysteries of the woman
and there is a beauty now that shines out.
REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING UP AT CORRY
As he reacts. He hesitates and then lets the shovel drop
out of his hand onto the sand. Very, very slowly he kneels
down to crouch very close to her. His hand reaches out and
touches the tears on her face and now his voice is gentle.
CORRY
You can cry too, can't you?
ALICIA
(nods)
With reason. And I can feel loneliness,
too.
Corry takes her arm and helps her to her feet, then stands
very close to her, looking down at her face.

CORRY
We'll go back inside now. We'll eat our
dinner.
ALICIA
All right.
She starts to walk on ahead of him.
CORRY
Alicia.
She turns to look at him.
CORRY
I don't care... I don't care how you were
born... or made. You're flesh and blood to
me. You're a woman.
(a pause)
You're my companion, Alicia. I need you
desperately.
CLOSE SHOT ALICIA
She smiles.
ALICIA
And I need you, Corry.
He goes up to walk alongside of her.
LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON THEM
As they walk toward the shack.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHACK PORCH [DAY]
MED. CLOSE SHOT CORRY
As he sits in the homemade rocker. He looks off toward the
horizon and then slowly begins to write as we hear his
voice.

CORRY'S VOICE
Alicia has been with me now for eleven
months. Twice when Allenby has brought the
ship in with supplies I've hidden her so
that the others wouldn't see her and I've
seen the question in Allenby's eyes each
time. It's a question I have myself. It's
difficult to write down what has been the
sum total of this very strange and bizarre
relationship. It is man and woman, man and
machine, and there are times even when I
know that Alicia is simply an extension of
me. I hear my words coming from her. My
emotions. The things that she has learned
to love are those things that I've loved.
He stops abruptly as he listens to Alicia singing from
inside the shack, He smiles and then continues to write
again.
CORRY'S VOICE
But I think I've reached the point now
where I shall not analyze Alicia any
longer. I shall accept her here simply as a
part of my life -- an integral part.
He continues to write silently now, turning the page to
continue on the other side, and then he stops, puts the
book and pencil down, rises, goes to the door and stands
there looking at Alicia, She turns to smile at him and he
enters the room. The CAMERA MOVES BACK so that it is
shooting at them through the open door and across the
ledger book which lies face up. We hear Corry's voice.
CORRY'S VOICE
Because I'm not lonely any longer. Each day
can now be lived with...
(a pause)
I love Alicia. Nothing else matters.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DESERT [NIGHT]
LONG SHOT LOOKING UP TOWARD A MOUND OF SAND
As hand in hand Alicia and Corry race down toward the

camera. He stops her abruptly and points to the sky.
CORRY
Alicia, look. That's the star, Betelgeuse.
It's in the constellation of Orion. And
there's the "Great Bear" with its pointer
stars in line with the Northern Star. And
there's the constellation Hercules. You
see, Alicia?
He traces a path across the sky with his upraised hand and
her eyes follow it. Then he turns to look down at her face
upturned in the half-light.
ALICIA
(softly)
God's beauty.
CORRY
(nods)
That's right, Alicia. God's beauty.
Suddenly the girl's eyes stop as they traverse the sky. She
points.
ALICIA
That star, Corry? What's that star?
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
As he stares at something in the sky.
CORRY
That's not a star. That's a ship, Alicia.
ALICIA
A ship?
Very slowly there's a ray of light that plays on both their
faces and gets brighter and larger. Alicia moves closer to
him.
ALICIA
There's no ship due here now, Corry. You
said not for another three months. You said
after the last time it wouldn't be for
(MORE)

ALICIA (CONT'D)
another -CORRY
(thoughtfully)
It must be Allenby's ship. It's the only
one that ever comes close. They stop at
other asteroids, then come here.
(he looks away again,
pensively)
That means they'll probably be here in the
morning.
(another pause)
I wonder why.
ALICIA
(takes a few steps toward
him, concerned)
Corry -- what's it mean?
CORRY
(turns to her and smiles)
In the morning... we'll find out. Come on,
let's go back to the house.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DESERT [DAY]
LONG SHOT TOP OF DUNES
Three space-suited figures appear. Allenby's in the
foreground. He suddenly stops and looks toward the camera
as Corry steps in front of it and into the frame.
ALLENBY
Hello, Corry. We wondered where you were.
CORRY
You have trouble?
ALLENBY
No, we had no trouble.
He motions the others to follow him and they walk down the
dune to stand close to Corry.

ALLENBY
This is a scheduled stop.
ADAMS
We've got good news for you, Corry.
CORRY
(looks from face to face)
I'm not interested.
The others exchange looks of surprise.
ALLENBY
You better hear what it is.
CORRY
You heard me, Allenby. I'm not interested.
ALLENBY
You will be. This I guarantee!
Corry takes a few backward steps looking paranoically from
one to the other.
CORRY
Allenby, give me a break, will you? I don't
want trouble.
ALLENBY
We don't either.
ADAMS
(to one of the others)
He gets worse! If we'd come a month later
he'd have been eating sand or something.
Corry now turns and starts to walk away from them,
occasionally looking over his shoulder.
ALLENBY
(calls out to him)
Corry!
TRACK SHOT CORRY AS HE WALKS
Faster and faster and is about to break into a dead run.
CUT TO:

LONG SHOT OVER CORRY'S SHOULDER LOOKING AT ALLENBY
Who now shouts.
ALLENBY
Corry!
He runs, crunching on the hard sand, to come up close to
Corry, He grabs him, whirls him around.
ALLENBY
It's this way, Corry, All the sentences
have been reviewed. They've given you a
pardon, We're to take you back home on the
ship, But we've got to take off from here
in exactly twenty minutes, We can't wait
any longer. We've been dodging meteor
storms all the way out. We're almost out of
fuel. Any longer than twenty minutes we'll
have passed the point of departure and then
I don't think we'd ever make it.
Corry stares at him and then at the other men who have come
down the dune behind him.
TIGHT CLOSE SHOT CORRY
His eyes dart about, going wide as the sense of what's been
said to him seeps in. He tries to speak, but for a moment
nothing comes out.
CORRY
Wait a minute, Allenby. Wait just a minute.
(he closes his eyes tightly,
then opens them)
What did you just say? What did you just
say about a -ALLENBY
(filling it in)
A pardon.
ADAMS
(coming up alongside)
But it won't do any of us any good unless
you get your stuff together and get ready
(MORE)

ADAMS (CONT'D)
to move, Corry. We've picked up seven other
men off asteroids and we've only got room
for about fifteen pounds of stuff, so you'd
better pick up what you need in a hurry and
leave the rest of it behind.
(then with a grin, looking
off in the direction of the
shack)
Such as it is.
CORRY
(struggling to keep his
voice firm but already it
begins to shake with joy and
excitement)
Stuff? My stuff? I don't even have fifteen
pounds of stuff!
He laughs uproaringly, turns, and again starts to walk
toward the shack.
TRACK SHOT ALL OF THEM AS THEY WALK
Corry's voice goes up and down in uncontrollable laughter,
a combination of nerves, relief and almost unbeatable
excitement. The words spew out as he walks.
CORRY
I've got a shirt, a pencil and a ledger
book. A pair of shoes.
(then he throws back his
head and laughs again)
The car you can keep here. That'll be for
the next poor devil.
ALLENBY
(evenly)
There won't be any next poor devil. There
won't be any more exiles, Corry. This was
the last time.
CORRY
Good! Wonderful! Thank God for that!
They continue to walk again.

CORRY
We'll let it rest here then. The farthest
auto graveyard in the universe! And Alicia
and I will wave to it as we leave. We'll
just look out of a porthole and throw it a
kiss goodbye. The car, the shack, the salt
lakes, the range. The whole works! Alicia
and I will just -He stops abruptly, suddenly conscious of the silence and
the looks.
PAN SHOT ACROSS THE FACES OF THE OTHER MEN
As they stare at him.
ADAMS
(his eyes narrow)
Who? Who, Corry?
TIGHT CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY
His eyes close for a moment.
ALLENBY
(sotto)
Oh my dear God, I forgot her!
GROUP SHOT
Corry's eyes move around from face to face.
CORRY
Allenby -(and then accusative)
Allenby, it's Alicia -CARSTAIRS
(whispers under his breath
to Adams)
He's out of his mind, isn't he?
ADAMS
Who's Alicia, Corry?

CORRY
(laughs uproariously)
Who's Alicia? Adams, you idiot! Who's
Alicia! You brought her! You brought her
here in a box! She's a woman -(and then he stops, looks
away for a moment, softly,
then looks toward Allenby)
A robot.
(and then once again looks
at Allenby)
But closer to a woman. She's kept me alive,
Allenby. I swear to you -- if it weren't
for her -He looks around again at the circle of silent faces that
stare at him.
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
CORRY
What's the matter? You worried about
Alicia?
(he shakes his head)
You needn't be. Alicia's harmless. I tell
you she's like a woman. And she's gentle
and kind and without her, Allenby, I tell
you without her I'd have been finished. I'd
have given up.
(a long pause and then very
quietly)
You would have only had to come back to
bury me!
GROUP SHOT
ADAMS
(to Allenby)
That's what you wouldn't let us look at,
huh? The crate with the red tag -CORRY
(to Allenby)
Sorry, Captain, but I had to let it out --

ALLENBY
That's all right, Corry. That's all over
with, but unfortunately that's not the
problem -CORRY
(again with a high
uncontrollable laugh)
Problem? There aren't any problems! There
are no more problems left on heaven or
earth! We'll pack up fifteen pounds of
stuff and we'll climb in that ship of yours
and when we get back to that beautiful
green earth -TIGHT CLOSE SHOT CORRY
CORRY
(he whispers it)
Fifteen pounds.
(and then he shouts it)
Fifteen pounds?
(he looks from face to face
again)
You've got to have room for more than that.
Throw out stuff. Throw out equipment.
Alicia weighs more than fifteen pounds.
GROUP SHOT
ALLENBY
(quietly)
That's the point, Corry. We're stripped
now. We've got room for you and nothing
else except that ledger of yours and the
pencil.
(he shakes his head)
You'll have to leave the robot here.
CORRY
(shouting)
She's not just a robot, Allenby. You don't
understand. You leave her behind -- that's
murder.

ALLENBY
(shakes his head)
I'm sorry, Corry -- I don't have any choice
-CORRY
(backing away, his voice
desperate)
No, Allenby. You don't understand. You
can't leave her behind.
(and then he screams)
Alicia, come here!
(then he turns to them)
You'll see. You'll see why you can't leave
her behind.
(then he shouts again)
Alicia!
LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN
As Corry races toward the shack followed by the others.
CUT ABRUPTLY TO:
INT. SHACK
As Corry smashes open the door and races inside only to
find the room empty. He stands in the middle of the room
looking around and then over toward the door as Allenby
enters followed by the other men.
ALLENBY
Where is she, Corry?
CORRY
I don't know. But when you see her you'll
know why you can't leave her behind.
ADAMS
Look, Corry. We just want you to get your
gear packed and get out of here.
(he looks at his watch,
nervously to Allenby)
We've only got about ten minutes. How about
it, Captain?

ALLENBY
(gently)
Come on, Corry.
CORRY
(backs further into the
room)
No! I'm not leaving, Allenby. I told you
that. I can't leave.
ALLENBY
You don't understand. This is our last trip
here. This is anybody's last trip. This is
off the route now. That means no supplies,
no nothing. That means it you stay here you
die here. And that way, there'd be a day,
Corry, when you'd pray for that death to
come quicker than it's bargained for -CORRY
(illogically, half- wildly)
I can't help it Allenby. I can't leave her
behind. And you won't take her. So that
means I stay.
(and then looking over his
shoulder wildly, he screams)
Alicia! Come here, Alicia! Let them see
you. Don't be afraid -CLOSE SHOT ALLENBY
ALLENBY
Corry, listen to me. I saw this... this
thing get crated, shoved into a box.
CORRY
(shakes his head)
I don't care.
ALLENBY
She's a machine, Corry. She's a motor with
wires and tubes and batteries.

CORRY
(screaming)
She's a woman!
Allenby wets his lips, bites his lip for a moment standing
there unsure, not knowing what to do. Through the window,
outside in the yard, we see another member of the crew walk
through the yard, pause near the shack.
CREWMAN
Captain? Captain Allenby?
ALLENBY
What?
CREWMAN
Captain, we've got just four minutes left.
We've got to take off! If we wait longer
than that, sir, we'll have moved to a point
too far out. I don't think we'll make it,
sir.
ADAMS
(his voice frightened)
How about it, Captain Allenby, leave him
here!
ALLENBY
We can't leave him here. Sick mad, or halfalive, we've got to bring him back. Those
are the orders.
He takes another step toward Corry who backs against the
wall.
ALLENBY
Corry, now it isn't just you. Now it's all
of us. So that means we can't talk any more
and we can't argue with you. We simply just
have to take you!
He makes a quick motion with one hand. Adams and Carstairs
take a step into the room to flank Allenby and to converge
on Corry. Corry, with a kind of animal shout bulls his way
past them pushing Adams out of the way and bolts out of the
door.

CUT TO:
LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON THE DESERT
At the figure of Corry as he races, stumbling, falling,
picking himself up again. His voice can be heard shouting
over and over again.
CORRY
(shouting)
Alicia! Alicia!
DIFFERENT ANGLES OF HIM RUNNING
The others in pursuit.
LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING UP TOWARD A DUNE
As he suddenly appears at the top and stares down. CAMERA
SWEEPS to the left and down for a shot of Alicia standing
alone down in the depression of the sand.
FULL SHOT THE PLACE
CORRY
Alicia!
Behind him Allenby and the others appear, Corry starts
toward the girl, Carstairs tackles him and then Adams
pounces on him, They hold him tight as he shouts.
CORRY
Alicia, talk to them. Tell them you're a
woman -Allenby takes a few steps down the dune and stops halfway
down. He looks back at Corry.
ALLENBY
I'm sorry, Corry, I don't have any choice.
(a pause. His voice is
quiet)
I have no choice at all.
CLOSE SHOT HIS HAND
As it unbuckles the gun holster on his belt.

TIGHT CLOSE SHOT CORRY
His eyes go wide.
CORRY
(screams)
No, Allenby! No! She's a human being!
FLASH SHOT BEHIND ALICIA
Looking straight up at the dune at Allenby, who takes the
gun out and fires directly into her face.
ANGLE SHOT LOOKING UP TOWARD THE BACK OF ALICIA
As very slowly she crumples to the sand blotting out the
camera momentarily.
CLOSE SHOT CORRY
His fingers convulsively move away from his face and fall
to his side. He takes three slow steps down the dune toward
the crumpled figure. Then he looks down. PAN SHOT with his
eyes to a close shot of Alicia's hand clenched tightly. A
further PAN shot across her arm and shoulder to the back of
her head. Then a very SLOW PAN shot two or three feet
across the ground to a shot of the remnants of a broken
machine, twisted and bent wires, a cracked eye, a couple of
fragments of plastic, all the remains of a face.
GROUP SHOT THE MEN
With Corry in the foreground. A few feet behind him is
Allenby, and then on the dune are the others. Crewman comes
into the frame in the background.
CREWMAN
It's got to be now, Captain Allenby!
ALLENBY
(nods, softly)
It will be now!
(then he turns to Corry)
Come on, Corry. It's time to go home.
Now numbly, without direction, Corry allows himself to be
led up the dune and across the desert.

LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON THEM
As they walk. The light from the ship gets brighter and
brighter as they approach it.
CLOSE GROUP SHOT AS THEY PAUSE
For a moment, Corry looks back at the crumpled figure in
the distance, then again turns and begins to walk.
TRACK SHOT WITH THEM
As their feet crunch on the sand past the shed, the car and
all the rest of it.
ALLENBY
(alongside Corry)
It's all behind you now, Corry. All behind
you. Like a bad dream. A nightmare... and
when you wake up you'll be on earth. You'll
be home.
CORRY
Home?
ALLENBY
That's right.
(a long pause, putting his
hand on Corry's arm)
All you're leaving behind Corry, is
loneliness.
TIGHT CLOSE SHOT CORRY'S FACE
As the tears roll down his cheeks. His eyes move down to
the sand by his feet and for a moment his face is impassive
and immobile. He nods slowly.
CORRY
I must remember to... I must remember to
keep that in mind!
Then he turns to walk ahead of the others.
LONG ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN AT THE LITTLE GROUP OF MEN
As they pass the shack and then move away into the night
toward the distant light that flickers on them, beckons

them away. The CAMERA PANS them and up into the starry
night sky.
NARRATOR'S VOICE
Down below, on a microscopic piece of sand
that floats through space, is a fragment of
a man's life. Left to rust is the place he
lived in and the machines he used. Without
use they will disintegrate from the wind
and the sand and the years that act upon
them. All of Mr. Corry's machines...
including the one made in his image, kept
alive by love, but now... obsolete... in
the Twilight Zone!
FADE TO BLACK:
THE END
