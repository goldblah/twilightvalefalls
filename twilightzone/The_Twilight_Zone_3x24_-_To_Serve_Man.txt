propulsion into starry night, then PAN DOWN TO OPENING SHOT

DISSOLVE TO:
3. INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY [DAY]

A giant cavernous room, at this moment absolutely empty and
devoid of sound.

DISSOLVE TO:

4. Pan shot across the front row of desks Taking in a shot

of the cards on each desk: "United States of America," "United
Kingdom," "India," "Argentina," et cetera. Over this pan we
hear Serling's voice.

SERLING‘S VOICE
This is the General Assembly of the
United Nations at four o'clock in
the afternoon on a given day. Kindly
note: the room is empty. But this is
due not to a long lunch hour, not to
the end of the world, and not to any
labor trouble on the ambassadorial
level. The representatives of the
nations of the world are at this
moment watching their television
sets and listening to their radios
much as are the people in the
countries they represent throughout
the earth.

DISSOLVE TO:

5. Large double oaken doors With the title printed on them
on a brass plate, "Secretary General."

SERLING'S VOICE
For as we will soon see...this is a
rather momentous afternoon.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

6. INT. SECRETARY GENERAL'S OFFICE EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE
SHOT SECRETARY'S FACE

Perspiring, haggard, torn. The CAMERA PULLS BACK for a shot
of the room, loaded with reporters, tv cameras, and a myriad
collection of shouting, gesturing, milling people. Cameramen
keep shouting to the secretary to turn this way and that way
for a better shot. Radio technicians keep thrusting
microphones closer to his face and throughout, the Secretary

pleads, exhorts, supplicates for a semblance of sanity in
the room.

SECRETARY
Please, gentlemen. Please. May we
have quiet, please? Would you give
me your attention?

7. Different angle the room As U.N. guards move around,
desperately trying to bring quiet. In this shot we see a
long line of interpreters, each sitting in front of their
own small table with a microphone.

8. Different angle Secretary General As he rises.

SECRETARY (CONT'D)
((over the growing
quiet)
I have a prepared statement. I say,
I have a prepared statement...
(louder now)
May I read it now, please? Would you
give me your attention, please?

At this point quiet gradually takes hold and all eyes are on
him as he rises and picks up a typewritten sheet. He dabs at
the perspiration on his forehead and grips the paper more
tightly to stop his fingers from trembling.

SECRETARY (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen...ladies and
gentlemen...I should like to
recapitulate the events of the past
eleven days.

The CAMERA.MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM to move down the row of
interpreters as each, in his native tongue, starts to
simultaneously translate the Secretary's announcement.

9. Close shot Secretary General

SECRETARY (CONT'D)
On the Fourteenth of March short-
wave broadcasts were received in the
principal capitals of the world.
These messages very obviously did
not originate on Earth. This has
been scientifically attested to.
Rather, they came from an
extraterrestrial race calling
themselves the Kanamits. The first
messages were somewhat cryptic,
announcing merely that there would
be multiple landings made at various
points around the Earth. We were

SECRETARY
further told that these landings
would be peaceable and that we should
take no alarm. These...these
broadcasts continued over the past
several days, each growing somewhat
stronger than its predecessor.

10. Pan shot around the faces of the people In the room. The
drone of the interpreters' voices continues underneath.

11. Back to scene

SECRETARY (CONT‘D)
At eleven this morning, eastern
standard time, the first of these
landings took place in an area just
outside of Newark, New Jersey. We
have subsequently had reports of
other landings in the Soviet Union,
in Norway, the southern coast of
France, in an area around Rio de
Janeiro, and several others. As of
this moment we have not seen the
occupants of the crafts that have
landed. Speaking on behalf of the
United Nations, I can tell you only
that at this moment it would be
premature to assume hostile intent
on the part of these...those Kanamits.
So it is the position of the United
Nations that the world population
remain calm...to make no hostile
move...and to keep in mind that all
governments are being appraised of
the events as they happen and have
the situation well in—

REPORTER #1
What do they look like?

CUT TO:

12. Full shot the room As several other people take up this
shout.

REPORTER #1 & REPORTER #2
Yeah, what do they look like? Why
are they coming? Who are they?

13. Different angle Secretary General Who holds up his hands.

SECRETARY
Please, gentlemen. Please. As of
this moment we do not know what they
look like or who they are. We know

( MO RE 1»

SECRETARY (CONT ' D)
only that several of their craft
have landed and that-

CUT TO:

14. Long shot across the room of the double doors As they
suddenly swing open and several guards enter along with a
man in a civilian suit, obviously some kind of dignitary. He
rushes across the room over to the Secretary General and
whispers something in his ear.

REPORTER #2
What's going on? What's happening?

Again various voices take up this question.
15. Close shot Secretary General As he mops his brow again.

SECRETARY

It seems that...it seems that one of
the craft has just landed a few blocks
away. One of the...one of the
representatives is on his way to
this building.

(he wipes his brow

again)
It appears that he-

(he turns to the

dignitary again,

wets his lips,

whispers something

in the other man's

ear, gets something

whispered back in

turn, then faces the

room again)
The...the "Kanamit" will be here
presently. He has requested an
audience with this organization.

He looks at the dignitary again who nods and then looks at
the clock. PAN OVER TO CLOCK then PAN BACK OVER for a shot
of the Secretary General who takes a deep breath and sits
down.

SECRETARY (CONT'D)
So for the moment I would ask you
again to all remain calm. One of
our...our "visitors" will very shortly
make himself known.

16. Pan shot around the faces again Winding up on a shot of
the double doors which have been closed, but which suddenly
begin to open. PAN BACK ACROSS THE ROOM, past the silent,
tense faces until we are once again on the Secretary General.
The silence is suddenly broken by the creaking doors.

17. Different angle the Secretary at this desk As a giant
shadow crosses it. The Secretary General, eyes widening,
looks first eye level, then slowly raises his eyes.

18.—21. Several shots of the people in the room As they too
lift their eyes. Over this we hear the clump, clump, clump
of footsteps as they enter the room.

22. Long shot across the room Of the Secretary General as he
slowly rises and into the frame, obliterating the camera, is
the giant back of the Kanamit who walks very slowly and
purposefully toward the desk at the far end of the room. All
we can tell from the rear is that this is a vast hulk of a
being over ten feet tall.

SLOW FADE TO BLACK20PENING BILLBOARD-FIRST COMMERCIAL-FADE
ON:

23. INT. SECRETARY GENERAL’S ROOM [DAY] CLOSE SHOT THE
KANAMIT'S FINGERS

Drumming on the table. The perspective here is that of a
huge hand on a very small surface. The CAMERA PULLS BACK for
a shot of the Kanamit sitting in a chair several sizes too
small for him. (Note: We never see the "creature" at the
same time as the actual people and are reminded of his size
in his relationships to other objects like chairs, tables,
ashtrays, etc.) The CAMERA MOVES AROUND for a shot of the
profile of the Kanamit. He is vast, all—enveloping, and when
he finally does turn toward the camera, we see that his face,
while humanoid in general appearance, is almost as if someone
had been sculpturing if and had left the job prematurely. It
has two eyes, very wide apart, a small opening that passes
for a nose, and a tiny, almost imperceptible circular hole
that passes for mouth. But when the creature speaks the face
remains immobile and the voice has a tinny, recorded quality.
It looks SIOle around the room, then holds up a right hand
in the traditional gesture of peace.

KANAMIT
Ladies and gentlemen of the Earth,
we greet you in peace and friendship.
We come from a planet far beyond the
known universe. A planet far more
developed than Earth, but we come as
friends. Our...
(the creature turns
away as if searching
for a word)
Our intentions are honorable. We
desire above all things to help the
people of Earth. To establish...

down and takes out a

small booklet which

he refers to. He

then nods lumberingly,

looks back up)

future to set up reciprocal visits
between Earth people and Kanamits.

reactions,

and most basically — concerns.

Speaking on behalf of the governments
of the people of Earth, we bid you
welcome.

KANAMIT
Not in the accepted sense, so you
need not make reference to me by
name. But feel free to ask me any
questions. Any question at all, of
any nature.

27. Shot Secretary General From behind the Kanamit,
emphasizing the size.

28. Close

SECRETARY
We have many questions. But for the
moment I think we are most interested
in first, how you discovered us, how
you know our language, the nature of
your own planet, its political and
social makeup—

shot Kanamit As its eyes blink.

KANAMIT
First of all — we must make the
following admission. We do not know
your language. And further...our own
methods of communication are mental
rather than verbal. Hence, the voice
you hear me speaking with is totally
mechanical. Your words, or rather
your thoughts, are fed into an
automatic translator and my responses
are in turn electronically altered

language known to you.

You cannot speak, then.

KANAMIT (CONT'D)

Speak.

(he looks away)
Speak.

(then back to Secretary)
Not in the sense that you Earth people
can speak. But as to the other
questions, our planet is not known
to you astronomically. It lies far
beyond your knowledgeable universe.
But it is a technological, highly
advanced planet. Its political and
social make-up is highly complex and
I cannot describe it to you without
first educating you in some of the
basics of our mores and habits.

shot Secretary General As he slowly sits down.

SECRETARY
Would you be willing to be
interrogated here at our United
Nations in a special plenary session,
at which time all our nations'
representatives could make inquiries
of you?

shot Kanamit Who once again looks down at his book.

KANBMIT
I would be...delighted.

SECRETARY {CONT'D)

Members of the General Assembly, our
Visitors...the Kanamits...have
graciously acceded to our request
that they appear in front of us to
answer any questions. We felt it
would be more practical to televise
the...the representative in order to
facilitate the questioning. This
meeting is hereby called to order
and the questioning will proceed.

(then looking over

the sea of faces in

front of him)
Senor Valdes of Argentina is
recognized.

37. Close shot delegate Valdes As he rises.

VALDES
Precisely why have you chosen our
planet for a visit?

CUT TO:

38. Television screen The Kanamit's head drops forward, then
looks up.

KANAMIT
It has come to our attention that
Earth has been plagued by both natural
and unnatural catastrophes, all of
which could easily be acted upon and
prevented. We are here to help you.

CUT TO:
39. Secretary General
SECRETAR!
Recognizing Dr. Denis LeVeque, the

representative of France.

CUT TO:

40. The delegate who rises

LEVEQUE
Monsieur...my government wishes me
to ask you the nature of your help.
What forms will it take? Indeed, if
we should not prefer to avail
ourselves of these various...aids
that you mentioned — your response
would be what?

41. Close shot screen As the Kanamit reaches down and checks
the booklet, then looks up.

KANAMIT

We will not force anything on you.
You will take only that which you
choose to take. For example...on the
morrow—

(he checks the book

again)
Tomorrow that is, we will demonstrate
to all interested parties a new and
extremely interesting power source
which is atomic in nature and which
can supply a form of electric power
to entire countries for the cost of
a few...

(he looks down at his

booklet again)
A few dollars...or rubles...or
pesos...or what have you. It's
extremely economical.

42. Close shot Secretary General Suddenly hearing a loud
voice, looks over the faces.

SECRETARY
Mr. Gregori, the delegate from the
Soviet Union.

43. CLOSE SHOT GREGORI

A bald, paunchy man with a sizeable chip on his shoulder,
who rises and gestures fiercely as he speaks.

GREGORI
The people of the Soviet Union should
like to ask the Kanamits precisely...I
repeat that to him...9recisely what
are its motives in coming here quite
uninvited. Are we to assume that
your purposes are so totally
altruistic that you have a singular
and abiding interest in helping
others, and may we further assume
there is nothing ulterior in these
(MORE)

GREGORI (CONT'D)
motives beyond this vast humanity
that you have mentioned.

There's a murmur of reaction in the room as we CUT TO:
44. CLOSE SHOT KANAMIT

(We are actually alongside of him now. This is not on the
screen) He looks up, blinks his eyes.

KANAMIT

There is nothing ulterior in our
motives. Nothing at all. You will
discover this for yourselves before
too long simply by testing the various
devices which we will make available
to you. We can show you, for example,
how to add nitrate to the soil and
end famine on Earth for good and
all. We can demonstrate to you quite
practically the principles of the
force field in which you may cloak
each nation with an invisible wall
absolutely impenetrable by bombs,
missiles, or anything else. We ask
only that you...

(he looks at the book

again}
trust us. Only that you simply...trust
us!

THE CAMERA FANS DOWN to where the notebook has slipped from
his lap to land on the floor.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:
45. Tight close shot notebook lying on a desk

This time in relationship to the desk and other books. A
giant encyclopedialike affair. PULL BACK for FULL SHOT OF
THE ROOM, obviously a decoding room where, lining the walls
in profusion, are charts, cylinders, electric cryptographs,
and telegraph cipher machines. There are three men in the
room, but the camera favors Mike Chambers who sits at a desk
and pores over several volumes, constantly cross—referencing
with the "notebook" of the Kanamit. Chambers is in mufti,
but the other two are field grade officers.

COLONEL ONE
Well, Chambers? What have you got?

Chambers looks up from his work, rubs his obviously fatigued
eyes, shakes his head.

CHAMBERS
A corker of a migraine headache and
eye strain.

.L.L-

COLONEL ONE
((points to notebook)
Can't lick it?

CHAMBERS

Not in eight hours, I can't. Colonel,
it took us almost a year to crack
the Japanese code and we had an army
of men working on it.

(he points to the

papers in front of

him)
This is a language of people from
outer space, probably five hundred
times as intelligent as we are and a
thousand times more complex.

COLONEL TWO
You need help?

CHAMBERS

(laughs wryly)
All donations gratefully accepted.
But I showed this stuff to every man
on our staff and I've had a dozen
people working on it since late last
night.

(he looks down at the

papers in front of

him, reaches over

and turns the notebook

around)
We've tried pretty much everything.
Single transposition. Double
transposition. We've tried every
known method of cryptography that
there is.

(he makes a gesture

toward the notebook)

46. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT COVER OF NOTEBOOK
There is a single line of strange—looking letters.

CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
I don't know whether we've even come
close or if we're still a million
miles away.

COLONEL ONE
You can't decipher it?

CHAMBERS
We can keep trying, that's all.
Standard, direct, reversed,

CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
systematically—mixed, keyword—mixed,
random—mixed, reciprocal,
conjugate...every nature of sequence
of letters that we can come up with.
But I'm gonna tell you something
right now, Colonel. This is a tough
nut. This is a real tough nut.

(he looks up to stare
across at the two
officers over the
lamp which is the
single illumination
in the room)
Important, is it?

The two officers look at one another.

COLONEL ONE
I don't know. That...that Kanamit or
whatever he calls himself dropped
this yesterday at the U.N. All we
know about it is that he was making
reference to it every third line he
spoke. The White House seems to feel
that if we could decipher this
book...we might be able to decipher
the Kanamits themselves.

CHAMBERS
Do they need deciphering? They've
done all right by us so far.

 

COLONEL TWO
Parlor tricks—

CHAMBERS

(shakes his head)
They don't seem like parlor tricks,
Colonel. That nitrate device they
demonstrated in Argentina this
morning. Six hours later that soil
had more vitamins in it than a
drugstore chain. I know that country.
That‘s as barren and fruitless as
any place on Earth. And there are
actually weeds growing in it six
hours after the nitrate process was
used.

(he looks at the

notebook and opens

it, rifles through

its giant pages)
We might lick this and we might not.

But I got a strange feeling that—

(then he looks up
again)
And I got another funny feeling,
too.

shot

COLONEL ONE
(a little acidly)
And that is?

CHAMBERS
That if these Kanamits are as helpful
as I think they are — you two boys
will be out of a job. Probably so
will I. And very likely so will the
whole U.N. You won't need armies or
navies or air forces of security
divisions or world courts. I think
they‘ll all be obsolete.

COLONEL ONE
(somewhat miffed, waggles a
deprecating finger toward the
notebook)
Am I to assume, Chambers, that this
is a scientific analysis — or some
Kentucky windage!

CHAMBERS

(shaking his head)
I don't knOw what it is, Colonel —
beyond an instinctive feeling. This
instinctive feeling tells me that
when this Earth gets enough to eat,
when there aren't any more wars or
diseases or famines...this is going
to be a Garden of Eden that stretches
from pole to pole.

shot Colonel One As he lights a cigarette in abrupt,

terse, very military movements.

COLONEL ONE
Colonel One
Your optimism is refreshing, Mr.
Chambers. But for the time being I'd
consider it a personal favor, not to

COLONEL ONE (CONT'D)
say a direct order from the Chief of
Staff, that you continue your process
of deciphering until you can break
this code or this language or whatever
it is and tell us precisely - and I
mean Erecisely — what that bloody
book says!

CUT TO:

51. Long shot across the room As Pat Brody enters the room,
an attractive thirty-year—old, carrying a sheaf of papers.
She looks briefly at the two officers and carries the stuff
over to Chambers and puts it on the desk.

52. Close shot Pat Her face is tired from strain, but at
this moment shiningly triumphant.

PAT
We've licked the title of it, anyway.

The two officers move toward her excitedly.

COLONEL ONE
What does it say?

COLONEL TWO
Can you translate it?

Pat points to a sheet of overlay which she puts on top of
the Kanamit's notebook. We see the title superimposed over
the Kanamit's title and it reads, To Serve Man.

53. CLOSE SHOT THE COLONEL

Reacting as he slowly picks up her sheet of paper and studies
it. PAN OVER TO SHOT OF CHAMBERS who wears a thin smile.

CHAMBERS
That makes the cheese a little more
binding, doesn't it, Colonel?
(he points to notebook)
Our visitor's little text book bears
the following title — To Serve Man.
I'd call that a reasonably altruistic

phrase.
(he looks briefly at
the girl)

Wouldn't you agree?

54. Close shot Pat As she looks first at the paper in the
Colonel's hand then over to the notebook, then to a newspaper
draped over the corner of the desk with a picture of the
Kanamit standing out in sharp relief. She moves over to the
paper and studies it, then looks up.

PAT
I'd like to believe it. But I...I...
(and she looks up
frowning and from
face to face)
I don't know what to think.

stares at the notebook on the desk.

The CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM HIM over to the desk to take in an
extremely tight close shot of the notebook.

FADE TO BLACK-END OF ACT ONE-ACT TWO—FADE ON:
56. INT. SECRETARY GENERAL'S OFFICE

There are perhaps eight men in the room, each representing a
different country. Set up on the Secretary's desk is a 16mm
motion picture projector. There's a murmur and buzz of
conversation. The Secretary rises.

SECRETARY
Gentlemen, may I have your attention,
please.

The murmuring stops. The Secretary points to the machine.

SECRETARY (CONT'D)
The purpose of this meeting is to
acquaint you with certain tests
conducted over the past week. At the
request of several delegates and the
full consent of our "guests," the
Kanamits, these tests were
photographed and you can watch them
now.

57. Pan shot across the faces of the men As they murmur
amongst themselves.

58. Long shot across the room As the Secretary General makes

a motion and the lights go out. A projectionist pushes a
button and the projector starts shooting its bright light
across the room to a screen set up at the far end. The CAMERA
PANS OVER for a long shot of the screen where we see a Kanamit
seated on a chair. From his temples to his wrists are wires,
ultimately ending in the palm of his right hand and taped
there. Machines with dials can be seen at his side. They

seem diminutive in proportion to the Kanamit.

J.U.

59. Close shot two machines Two dials, each with its pointer
resting at zero, then a strip of paper with a stylus point
resting against it.

60. Close shot scientist in another part of the room The
scientist faces the audience.

SCIENTIST
These are the standard instruments
for testing the truth of a statement.
Our first object, since the physiology
of the Kanamit is unknown to us, was
to determine whether or not they
react to these tests as human beings
do. We will now repeat one of the
many experiments which were made in
an endeavor to discover this.

He points to the first dial.

61. Close shot the dial Scientist This instrument registers
the subject's heart beat. This shows the electrical
conductivity of the skin in the palm of his hand, a measure
of perspiration, which increases under stress.

CAMERA PANS OVER to the other machine.

SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
And this — shows the pattern and
intensity of the electrical waves
emanating from the brain.

62. Close shot scientist

SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
It has been shown, with human
subjects, that all these readings
vary markedly depending upon whether
the subject‘s speaking the truth.

He picks up two large pieces of cardboard, one red about
three feet on the side and the other black, a rectangle three
and a half feet long. He turns toward the Kanamit.
SCIENTIST (CONT’D)
Which of these is longer than the
other?

KANLMIT
The red.

64. CLOSE SHOT THE MACHINES

Both needles leap wildly and so does the line on the unrolling
tape.

I shall repeat the question. Which
of these is longer than the other?

their normal rhythm.

SCIENTIST
How did you come to this planet?

Walked.

There's a ripple of laughter in the room.

SCIENTIST
Once more — how did you come to this
planet?

KANAMIT

In a spaceship.
71. Close shot machines As they do not jump.
72. Different angle scientist

SCIENTIST

Many such experiments were made and
my colleagues and myself are satisfied
that the mechanisms are effective.

(he half turns toward

Kanamit)
Now — I shall ask our distinguished
guest to reply to the question put
at the last session by several
delegates. Namely —what is the motive
for the Kanamit people in offering
these great gifts to the people of
Earth?

73. CLOSE SHOT KANAMIT

As he rises. The voice, a strange metallic riddle, but
nonetheless a voice.

KANAMIT
On my planet there is a saying, "There
are more riddles in a stone than in
the philosopher's head." The motives
of intelligent beings, though they
may at times appear obscure, are
simple things compared to the complex
workings of the natural universe.
Therefore I hope that the people of
Earth will understand and believe
when I tell you that our mission
upon this planet is simply this — to
bring to you the peace and plenty
which we ourselves enjoy, which we
have in the past brought to other
races throughout the galaxy. When
your world has no more hunger, no
more war, no more needless suffering,
that will be our reward!

74. Close shot the machines As they continue a very normal

path.

75. Full shot the room As the screen goes black. There is
again a slow murmur of the voices. The Soviet delegate rises.

GREGORI
I should like to pose the question -
who promoted that circus?

SECRETARY
These tests are quite genuine.

GREGORI
A circus! A second—rate farce. If
they were genuine, Mr. Secretary -
why was the debate stifled?

SECRETARY
There'll be time for further debates
tomorrow, the next day, and throughout
the week. No one is stifling debate.

LEVEQUE

(French delegate)
I would remind the delegate from the
Soviet Union that everything the
Kanamit has promised — has not only
worked, but worked beyond our most
hopeful expectations. The force field —
that was tested yesterday morning. A
firecracker couldn‘t get through.
And we suddenly find ourselves in
that strange millennium when none of
us need fear a hydrogen bomb or a

LEVEQUE {CONT'D}
missile. We are on the threshold of
peace, Mr. Gregori. On the threshold
of peace as we've never known it.

There's a murmur of affirmative response and the disgruntled
Soviet delegate, white—faced, turns and stalks out of the
room.

DISSOLVE TO:

76. A shot of Kanamit tilt and filling the screen Gesturing,
beckoning, handing out papers, small black boxes, bottles of
pills. A very stylized concept of giving with many hands
receiving. SUPERED OVER THIS are newspaper headlines. They
read as follows: "Fertility of arable land increased by one
hundred percent," "Famine thing of the past," “Heart disease
and cancer cure assured by Kanamit injection," "No more war,
promises Kanamit, as tests prove effectiveness of 'force
field.'"

Of these newspapers falling on top of one another, winding
up on a:

BACK from a shot of the newspaper that is lying on Chambers's
desk. CAMERA PULLS BACK FARTHER for a shot of the various
machines, now shrouded with canvas. The room has a look of
decay and disuse. Chambers sits at the desk, hands behind

his head, staring up at the ceiling. Pat Brody, in a light
topcoat, sticks her head through the open door.

PAT
I‘m going home, boss. Need me for
anything?

CHAMBERS

(looks up and smiles
a little wanly)
Need you for anything? Like what?
(he points to the
shrouded machines)
This is not what you'd call a beehive
of activity.

79. Different angle Pat As she smiles and walks into the
room, sitting down in a chair near him.

PAT
This is the new story of man! Nobody
needs to decipher much of anything
any more because there aren't any
more codes simply because there aren't
any more secret messages.

(MORE)

PAT (CONT'D)

(she looks away, her

voice a little

reflective)
Odd.

(then looking toward

him)
I mean, not reading about hydrogen
bombs or war scares or insurrections
or anything like that anymore. There’s
a rumor going around that they're
going to disband the United Nations
inside of a month.

CHAMBERS
Millennium.

PAT
Or close to it.
(she rises, walks
over to the newspaper
where we see the
Kanamits' name in
big black letters
repeated over and
over again along
with his picture)
How many of them are here now? Anybody
ever figured it out?

CHAMBERS

A few thousand, I guess. They've got
embassies in every country now. And
for every one that comes - a thousand
of us take off in their ships to
visit them.

(he shakes his head)
That's the odd thing. The fantastic
ease with which human beings make
adjustments. One day they watch with
bated breath while a single person
orbits around the world in a rinky—
dink cubicle and they think of this
as the most historic moment in the
history of mankind. One year later
they stand in line waiting to get
into a space ship to take them a
hundred million miles away in space
and they act and react as if it were
a weekend picnic in the country.

(he makes a gesture

with his hands)
The strange and complex sanity of
man. Nothing fazes them.

PAT
Are you going?

CHAMBERS
I'm on one of the ten—year exchange
group waiting lists. What about you,
Pattie?

PAT

I'm on the list, too. The trouble is
their quota's filled twenty—four
hours after they make the announcement
of a new trip. But while I'm waiting
I think I'll do the next best thing.
I'm studying their language. I
remember a professor of mine told me
that language reflects the basis
assumptions of the people who use
it.

(she lights a cigarette)
I've got a fair command of their
spoken lingo already. It‘s not hard,
really. And there are hints in it.
Some of the idioms are quite similar
to English. I think I'll get the
answer eventually.

CHAMBERS
More power! I gave up a month ago.
They write in ideographs worse than
Chinese, but if I can help you in
any way-

80. Close shot Pat As she moves away, a strange look on her
face.

81. TWO SHOT

CHAMBERS (CONT‘D)
Did I say something-

PAT
(shakes her head)
If you could help me — that was the
phrase, wasn't it?
Chambers nods.
PAT (CONT'D)
The only thing you can help me with
is—
She looks off.

CHAMBERS
Is what?

82. Different two shot As the girl faces him.

83.

84.

LL.

PAT
Help me get rid of this strange little
know inside me. This very funny
persistent nightmarish feeling.

CHAMBERS
Nightmarish?

PAT
That's right. A little sixth sense,
if you will.

CHAMBERS
That tells you what?

Extremely tight close shot Pat As she looks up at him.

PAT
That tells me that maybe we should
have looked this gift horse in the
mouthi

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HUGE HANGAR

With a long line of people, each carrying similar small
handbags. There is a festive air even in the somewhat dark,
cavernous aspect of the room. Several signs point with arrows

and read:

"Loading platform this way."

85. Moving shot down the line of people Waiting. We hear
little bits of dialogue.

MAN ONE
They tell me they've got a mean
temperature of seventy-six degrees
on their planet and the sun never
goes down...

WOMEN ONE
And their clothing. It's a metallic
substance. Just beautiful. Kind of
like a spun gold. And my sister says
the day you land they take you on a
conducted tour through all their
shops and you can pick up as much of
it as you want.

MmN TWO
It's just one big holiday when you
get there. They've even got a form
of baseball or something like it,
leagues and everything just like
here. Man, I don't think I'll want
to come back once I do get there...

WOMAN TWO
And the whole trip, and it's millions
of miles, mind you...The whole trip
only takes just a few days.

The CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN down and in one very noticeable
moment we see the Soviet delegate standing there, all smiles,
with a rather chubby wife. Then we reach the end of the line
and we see Chambers standing there. The line starts to move
and we hear the voices of excited delight.

VOICES OF MEN #1 #2 WOMAN #1 & #2
Oh, we're moving. Good, we‘re ready
to leave. Isn’t this exciting? Etc.,
etc.

86. Different angle the line As they move through the hangar.
87. Long shot across the tops of their heads

Of a giant cavernous door which is now open as the people
file through. A space saucer, landing ladder down, can be
seen beyond open door.

88. Moving shot Chambers As he reaches a point close to the
door. He suddenly hears Pat's voice calling.

PAT
Mr. Chambers? Mr. Chambersi

89. Different angle Chambers As he turns.

90. Long shot across the room As Pat runs toward him. She
reaches him, out of breath, and pulls him to one side.

91. Two shot

CHAMBERS
(smiling)
You‘re just in time to say goodbye.

PAT
(looks briefly toward the door)
I know.
(then intensely)
Can you get out of this? Can you
refuse to go?

CEAMBERS<laughs)
Are you kidding? I've been waiting
six weeks for this. And don't say
that out loud or there'll be a
thousand people trampling over the
two of us to take my place.

{—‘2.

92. CLOSE SHOT PAT

As she again looks toward the door, this time with an
unconcealed horror.

93. Close shot Chambers As seen over her shoulder. His eyes
narrow.

CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
What's the matter, Pat? What's going
on?

94. Reverse angle looking toward her Her lips tremble.

PAT
I...I finally deciphered their
language. All of it. I read their
book.

95. Close shot a suspended speaker overhead A Kanamit's
metallic voice rings out.

KANAMIT'S VOICE
Please move ahead. You're holding up
our departure. Kindly move ahead.

CUT TO:
96. Two shot Chambers and Pat

CHAMBERS
Well?

PAT
Mr. Chambers...Mr. Chambers, the
first page is just a collection of
English words with their own
translation. But the rest of the
book...the rest of the book...

97. Close shot speaker

KANAMIT'S VOICE
Kindly move ahead, please. Through
the doors. You're holding up our
departure.

98. Back to scene

CHAMBERS
(pats her cheek}
Write me about it. I'll have plenty
of time to read letters. I'm going
up there for a rest more than
anything.

99. Different angle of him As he starts toward the door again,
leaving her standing there. He turns close to the door. In

Lu.

the frame we see the space—ship boarding ladder, the last of
the passengers are disappearing into the ship.

100. Long shot looking back toward Pat

PAT
(her lips quivering, tears in her
eyes)
Not so much time as you think. Mr.
Chambers...the rest of the book...

ZOOMAR INTO AN EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT Of her.

PAT (CONT‘D)
To Serve Man...it‘s a cook book!

101. Long shot Chambers As for a moment he looks stunned.
ZOOMAR INTO EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT HIS FACE as the horror
takes hold. Slowly a huge hand comes into the frame to touch
Chambers's cheek, pinch it lightly as if feeling for
tenderness, then the hand gently, but very firmly turns
Chambers around and propels up the stairs and they very slowly
close up. During the process of this closing, we hear
Serling's voice in narration.

SERLING‘S VOICE
The very explicit and very specific
differences in points of View. To
the wee ones...the little folk called
man...it‘s a marvelous adventure, a
voyage to another planet. An exciting
sojourn to another section of the
galaxy. But to the very large, granite—
faced inhabitants known as
Kanamits...it's nothing more than a
cattle car, a very comfortable
provisions ship bringing food from
the other end of the universe. Like
I say...it's all in the point of
view.

FADE TO BLACK.
