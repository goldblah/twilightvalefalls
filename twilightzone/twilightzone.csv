( he waits impatiently , conscious of misrell staring at him ) misrell 's voice ( from opposite side of room ) williams , we are still waiting for your mr. ross ! williams ( with a forced smile , over his shoulder ) ) I am trying to get him now , sir . ( then into phone ) this jake ross 's secretary ? joanie : where is he ? i know he is out to lunch . but there was a conference called here at two of the clock . it is now two—thirty , now where is he ! ( he wets his lips , forces his voice down an octave ) all right , check around . ( more ) ( continued ) continued : williams ( cont 'd ) call sardi 's east or the colony and tell him to get his keister back here in a hurry ! he slams down the receiver then fixes his face into a smiling , nonchalant mask and returns to the table . 5. track shot with him as he walks over to the table , sits down , again smiling toward mr. misrell . 6. close shot misrell who stares back at him , totally unsmiling . misrell well ? where is your protege with the three-million—dollar automobile account ? williams he ‘ s due at any moment , sir . probably a big lunch crowd or something— misrell do not be an idiot . more likely a big martini , or three or four of 'em . he was too young to put on this account — i told you that , williams . he is much too young to put on this large and important an account- there is a knock on the door . 7. moving shot with williams as he springs to his feet and hurries over to the big , double conference room doors . he opens it up . a young secretary hands him an envelope which he literally pulls out of her hand , slams the door behind him , rips open the envelope , and starts to read . 8. extremely tight close shot williams ‘ face as suddenly he looks white , stares up over the letter briefly toward misrell . 9. close shot misrell reacting . 10. close shot williams as his eyes slowly go downward and the letter in his hand drops to his side . he carries it very slowly over to the table and stands there at the far end . 11. reverse angle looking over his shoulder down the length of the table at misrell who very slowly drums on the table in a methodical , tapping that permeates the silence of the room . misrell well ? we have now been here thirty-four minutes , mr. williams . williams ( looks up from the letter , takes a deep breath ) this is a communication from jake ross . misrell would you be so kind as to share its contents with us ? 12. med . close shot williams as he looks down at the letter , spreads it out on the top of the table , then looks up from it . williams i can tell you the sense of it very quickly , mr. misrell . this is jake ross 's resignation . he is moving over to another agency . 13. close shot misrell as his face seems to freeze . misrell and ? 14. close shot williams as his face seems to freeze . williams and he is taking the automobile account with him . 15. pan shot down the faces of the men at the table as each seems to catch his breath and then look from misrell and with great compassion and concern over toward williams . misrell did you hear what i said , williams ? that account represented a gross billing of something in the neighborhood of three million dollars a year . and how many times have you promised it to me ? williams ( clears his throat and for a moment can not get a word out ) this is as much of a shock to me as it is to you , mr. misrell . misrell ( roaring ) do not con me , williams ! it was your pet project ! your pet project : then it was your idea to give it to that little college greeny ! now get with it , williams . get with it , boy ! he rises from his seat and goes to the window , his jowled , fleshy face screwed up like a little baby about to cry ; now he whirls around toward williams , points a finger at him . misrell ( cont ' d ) so what is left , williams ? not only has your pet project backfired but it is sprouted wings and left the premises ! I will tell you what is left to us in my view ! a deep and abiding concern about your judgment in men ! 16. pan shot down the faces of the men each of whom look down at their hands in a vast , biting embarrassment . 17. close shot williams as he closes his eyes for a moment , feels the sweat on his forehead and then unconsciously massages his stomach as an ulcer deep inside lights a match to his insides . 18. close shot misrell as he returns to the table , pounds the flats of his hands down on it . misrell this is a push business , williams ! a push , push , push business . push and drive , but personally . you do not delegate responsibilities to little boys . 19. close shot williams as he looks sick . misrell 's voice you should know it more than anyone else . the camera dollies in for an extremely tight , tight close shot of misrell 's face shooting at just the nose and little oval mouth that goes up and down and up and down . misrell a push , push , push business , williams . it is push , push , push all the way . all the time . right on down the line— 20. extremely tight close shot williams as suddenly he can not stand it any longer and shouts out . williams fat boy , why do not you shut your mouth ! 21.—25 . series of abrupt cuts from face to face of the men at the table , then misrell , then williams who suddenly exhales and realizes that the voice that suddenly exploded in the room like shrapnel was his own ! 25a . insert coffee cup drops to floor . 26. different angle williams as he closes his eyes for a moment , grabs at his stomach very tightly as once again the ulcer makes an assault on him , then he turns and walks quietly out of the room . cut to : 27. ext . conference room a line of desks two secretaries whisper to one another as he goes past them . 28. track shot williams as he continues to walk through the office . cut to : 29. int . different office area williams 's secretary , helen , sits at a desk and looks up as williams approaches . she forces a smile . helen messages on the desk , boss . and hot coffee out here . can i bring you some ? he shakes his head and starts toward the door . helen want anything at all ? he turns from the door and stares at her . williams yeah . a sharp razor and a chart of the human anatomy showing where all the arteries are ! he goes into the office and slams the door behind him . 30. int . williams 's office fluorescent tube lighting is on all around the room and the first thing he does is flick off the switch putting the room into a semi—darkness . then he walks over to a big , modern , expensive—looking desk , looks briefly at the picture of a beautiful woman on it , then sits down behind the desk and stares down at nothing . over this tableau we hear the narrator 's voice . narrator 's voice this is gart williams , age thirty—eight , a man protected by a suit of armor all held together by one bolt . just a moment ago , someone removed the bolt and mr. williams ‘ s protection fell away from him and left him a naked target . he is been cannonaded this afternoon by all the enemies of his life . his insecurity has shelled him ; ( more ) ( continued ) continued : narrator 's voice ( cont 'd ) his sensitivity has straddled him with humiliation ; his deep-rooted disquiet about his own worth has zeroed in on him , landed on target , and blown him apart . mr. gart williams , ad agency exec , who in just a moment will move into the twilight zone in a desperate search for survival ! fade to black opening billboard first commercial fade on : 31. int . commuter train [ night ] long shot down length of one of cars a conductor comes into the frame from behind the camera collecting the tickets of the few passengers who remain . dolly in with him toward williams who sits by himself at the far end of the car . conductor takes his ticket , punches it . 32. two shot the two men conductor one how are you tonight , mr. williams ? williams ( looks up , tiredly , with a wry grin ) in the absolute pink ! he turns and looks out toward the wintry , dark landscape . conductor one cold winter this year . seems to get darker earlier than it ever has . williams ( nods ) that is the way of the world . the rich get richer and the days get shorter ! the conductor chuckles , sticks the ticket into the slot in the back of the seat facing williams , then continues out of the car . 33. close shot williams as he leans back in the chair . his face looks tired and wan . he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes . ( continued ) continued : in his subconscious he heard the voice first of misrell and then other voices that spring up from his subconscious . over the tight , close shot of his face the voices come in filtered , discordantly loud , real and yet somehow a step beyond reality . misrell 's voice it is a push , push , push business , williams . it is an absolutely push , push , push business . it is a push , push , push business . you got to get with it , boy . it is a push , push , push business . you got to get with it , boy . it is a push , push , push business . you got to get with it , boy . 34. different tight angle williams 's face as his eyes go open and he shouts out . williams that is enough ! 35. reverse angle looking over his shoulder at woman in front of him who turns around , wide—eyed , and stares at him . 36. different angle williams as he turns away from her to stare out the window of the train . 37. angle shot over his shoulder at the wintry landscape outside in the darkness . his eyes close as he leans his head out the window and after a moment let us his head rest on the back of the seat , his eyes closed . the sound of the train comes up to provide a humming clickety clack sound as the camera moves in for an angle shot looking down from over the head of williams as he falls asleep . gradually the sound of the train takes on a different tone . it ‘ s imperceptible at first and then very obvious , almost as if the train we are going through a tunnel and there was an echoy effect . lights shoot by playing on williams 's face and on the interior of the train . the camera starts a slow pan down until it is directly in front of williams , shooting on him . then the camera pulls back to reveal an absolutely empty car and suddenly the entire car is suffused by sunlight and then the train is suddenly coming to a stop . dolly in for close shot of williams as his eyes open and suddenly blink . he takes a deep breath , looks at his watch , then looks out the window . 38. different angle williams 's face as he suddenly starts in amazement . slow pan shot up from him to a shot out the window . outside it is suddenly bright and sunny and obviously summer . the train has stopped in front of a small railroad station with a big sign which reads `` willoughby .

1|Twilight Zone|It's a Good Life|November 3, 1961|the twilight zone season three `` it is a good life '' teleplay by rod serling air date : november 3 , 1961 1. standard road opening with vehicle smashing into letters , propulsion into starry night then pan down to opening shot of play . 2. panoramic shot of ohio countryside stock shot favoring several small , attractive farmhouses , and off in the distance , the small typical country town . there are wheat fields that shine golden in the sunlight , and off in the distance , in one of these fields , a farmer using horses , plows up a section of the acreage . the sense of this whole scene in its preliminary is that of an almost idyllic , ageless beauty and repose . 3. different angle looking down a country road from the point of view of the front porch of the fremont house . playing on the front steps is a six-year—old child . this is anthony and he is the story . but at the moment we get only an indefinite view of him and to all intent and purpose he is simply an ordinary six—year—old boy . down the road we see a bicycle approach with a big basket strapped in front , carrying groceries . bill soames pedals it towards the fremont house . over this moving shot of the bicycle , we hear serling 's voice . serling 's voice this is peaksville , ohio , on a hot july afternoon . at this moment an old woman , aunt may , comes out onto the front porch and sits down , rocking herself slowly back and forth , fanning herself with an old , dilapidated fan . serling 's voice { cont'dj at a first , perfunctionary glance , and on the surface , you may think this is a town like all other towns . and that little boy over there , anthony by name , appears to be like any little boy . we whip pan over to serling who stands near the porch . serling but actually none of you have ever seen peaksville , ohio . it is a place not to be found on a map . and those fields of grain and wheat and barley that you have seen growing — that is not the only crop . something else grows in peaksville , and for want of a better term , we are forced to call it simply ... horror . but let anthony 's father tell you about it . everybody calls him just `` dad '' fremont . we ‘ ll let him tell the story . and we ‘ ll let him describe the horror . l- whip pan over to dad fremont working in one of the fields . he is a tall , granite—faced weather—beaten man in his fifties . he turns from hoeing and faces the camera , wipes the perspiration off his face . dad fremont that is right ... I am dad fremont . I am anthony 's father . ( he shakes his head ) do not ask me how we got that boy . or to explain why he is the wgy he is . he just got born one june six years ago and old doc baker - god rest him — took a look at him , screamed , dropped him and tried to kill him . anthony , my ... my sgg had whined then let out a cry ... and then ... then he done this thing . ( he looks away for a moment ) it is hard to explain . real hard to explain what this thing is , but ... but it appears that anthony destroyed the world and left only this village in it or he had taken the village someplace away from everything . we do not know exactly which . all we do know is that we are alone and there am not any towns or villages or anything else left except this place . and anthony ... he controls it with his mind . he controls everything . that is right that ... that little six— year—old boy on the porch over there . he can send people into a grave . or he can turn them into a walking horror ... anything he wants . ( then very thoughtfully ) that is right . anything he wants . he just turns his mind against you and ... ( he makes a tired gesture of resignation and accustomed horror ) so that is why when you walk down the street of the village or go past the house or any place ... simply any place where anthony might be ... you got to keep smiling or laughing or you got to mumble something to keep your mind clear . because anthony ... ahthony can tell what you are thinkin ' , and if it is a bad thought ... if it is a bad thought ... ( more ) dad fremont ( cont 'd ) ( the camera moves in for a much tighter shot of dad fremont as the face is suddenly a sunburned mask of bare , unadulterated naked fear ) anthony 's mind will snap at you and he ‘ ll do most anything . most anything at all . cut to : 4. long shot looking toward farmhouse where aunt amy rocks on the porch and the little boy sits a few feet away on the steps . dad 's voice like with aunt amy sittin ‘ on the porch there . she had more control over anthony than almost anybody . certainly more than me and his mother , but one day last winter she got angry at him and for just one instant ... that is all it took ... just one instant ... she forgot what he could do and she yelled at him . cut to : 5. closer angle aunt amy who sits there rocking with dull lusterless , almost insane eyes . dad 's voice ( cont 'd ) so anthony ... anthony ... he just looked up at her and he ... he turned her into what she is now . just a smiling , vacant thing . and she was so pretty once , too , and so bright . but when anthony 's mind snapped at her - that was the end of aunt amy 's bright eyes , and it was the end of amy fremont as everyone had known her . cut to : 6. different shot bill soames as he pedals up to the front porch and gets off the bike . dad 's voice ( cont 'd ) and that ‘ s why ... that is why everyone smiles around anthony now . because you can not take the risk of making the little boy angry . you just can not take that risk ... ‘ 2 . 7. moving shot bill soames carrying the groceries toward the house . we see in his face a nightmarish fear that is beyond the telling . he forces a smile that is grotesque in every aspect as he walks over toward the little boy . bill how do you , anthony . mighty good to see you today . mighty good . and it is such a good day . a real good day , is not it , anthony ? 8. close shot little boy the first close shot we have had of him . on the surface it is a little boy 's face , smudged with dirt , bright—eyed and not unattractive . but looking at it deeper we see that it is not really a normal face at all . perhaps it is in the eyes or in the look , but whatever it is , the eyes tell that this is a monster . he looks up at bill soames and nods . pan over to aunt amy as she slowly turns her vacant eyes over to soames . aunt amy ( fanning herself ) it ‘ s a terrible hot day , though . it is a terrible hot day . 9. close shot bill who looks agonized at her . bill ( ( he almost cringes when he speaks ) oh , i would not say that ... aunt amy . no , sir , i would not say that at all .

( he rises , looks down at something close to his feet ) go into the corn field . go be in the corn field . cut to : 16. close shot portion of ground where obviously a living , digging creature had been . 17. close shot anthony as he turns back toward bill . anthony ( cont 'd ) you do not want me to wish you dead , do you ? bill ( gulps , his face turns white ) why ... why no , anthony . no , i do not . but ... but you do some real fine things . real fine . you ‘ re a ... you ‘ re ( more ) bill ( cont 'd ) a good boy . anthony . we all love you . do not we , aunt amy ? do not we love anthony ? we sure do love him . we love that boy . the camera moves in tight on his face as tears appear in his eyes , and in just one brief , sporadic moment a sob tears itself away from his throat . he whirls around and carries a bag of groceries into the house . the camera starts a slow pan back away from the old woman , down to where anthony sits and stares out across at the field . serling 's voice in just a moment we will get even a closer look at anthony fremont and the people of the village and the village itself . peaksville , ohio , in a world in which nothing exists excegt peaksville . a world that anthony fremont manufactured . a nightmare that lies at the center of ... the twilight zone . fade to black -- opening billboard -- first commercial -- fade on : 18. int . farm kitchen fremont house [ day ] anthony 's mother is just checking a roast in the oven as bill soames brings in the grocery bag . mrs. fremont ( smiles at him ) how do you , bill . got everything ? bill pretty much , mrs. fremont .

( he smiles happily . then the smile fades ) he should not have thought those bad thoughts . that ‘ s why i did that to him . again the dog barks from outside . the camera moves in for an extremely close shot of anthony who turns and walks over to the window . anthony ( cont 'd ) that dog ... that collie dog ... he doesn ‘ t like me . he is a bad dog . at this moment something happens to the child 's eyes . they seem to burn fiercely . there is a piercing , screaming yelp of pain from the animal outside that fades off in a dissonant dying whisper and then there is silence . 32. moving shot dad fremont as he walks to his son 's side . dad fremont well now , anthony ... did you do something to bill soames 's dog ? did you ? as his eyes traverse the yard outside he suddenly stops , closes them and almost shakes . then his lips tremble and he tries to form words and finally words come out . .l ‘ 2- dad fremont ( cont 'd ) why ... why , is not that a good thing what you done , anthony . a real good thing . but it would be another good thing if you ... if you ... ( he closes his eyes again and the voice comes out as a kind of hoarse whisper ) if you wished what was left of him into the corn field . it is a good thing what you did to him but ... but ... the camera moves over to anthony , who nods , concentrates , then looks back at his father . anthony i put him in the corn field . he is not outside anymore . 33. different angle anthony as he turns and walks across the room and out . pan back over for a medium close shot of dad fremont as he stands at the window , his head down , fingers clenching and unclenching . footsteps approach and mrs. fremont enters the room . 34. close shot mrs. fremont her face is white and stricken . mrs. fremont bill soames ‘ s collie was out in the yard . i heard him barking and then he screamed . i did not see it happen , but aunt amy said it looked like somebody had taken a torch and— she stops abruptly and looks down at the floor . 35. two shot dad fremont ( smiles , nods , chuckles and it all comes out like some kind of maniacal masquerade ) why , anthony done that . it was a real good thing that anthony done it was not it honey ? was not it a real good thing ? mrs. fremont ( hurriedly , looking around ) oh yes . yes , indeed . it was a real good thing that anthony done that . well i ‘ ve got to get back and get supper ready . ethel 's bringing over a cake for dan . she found the last box of cane sugar that there was to be found . the very last box . and dan ( more ) her voice who turns j.j- mrs. fremont ( cont 'd ) has not got one single inkling that there is a surprise party for him . not one . dad fremont ( staring out the window , softly ) that is good . that is real good . mrs. fremont and you know how much dan likes music . well , last week thelma dunn found a record in her attic . dad fremont that a fact ! mrs. fremont yes ! and she is going to give it to him tonight , is not that a wonderful surprise ? dad fremont well , now , it sure is . a record . imagine ! that ‘ s a real nice thing to find ! what record is it ? mrs. fremont perry como singing , `` you are my sunshine .

'' `` much , much better . '' `` it was the best yet . '' mrs. fremont ( rises from the couch ) and now the big surprise for dan 's birthday . go ahead , ethel . give your hubby the big surprise . ethel goes over to a spot behind the sofa and takes a circular wrapped package . she hands it to hollis . he looks at it grinning . hollis what is this ?

I will play ... i'il play `` night and day . '' that ‘ s a nice old tune . j . ) - the people converge around the piano . there is a chorus of voices , `` yes , that is a good tune . '' `` it is good that you are going to play that . '' `` oh , that is lovely tune . '' 41. full shot the room as riley continues to play , camera pans over for a shot of dan hollis , who is drinking the brandy in long , thirsty gulps . every now and then he looks over at the record that he is placed on the table and once he reaches over to touch it in almost a caress . 42. close shot dad fremont watching hollis . 43. close shot ethel his wile , as she too , with nervous fingers in her mouth , watches her husband drink . 44. close shot hollis as once again he puts the bottle to his mouth , takes another long , long swig , then puts the bottle down , and in doing so upsets a cup . the noise of it is a shattering intrusion on the music and all eyes turn toward him . the last face to turn in his direction is that of anthony . 45. mad . close shot anthony who surveys the man coldly . anthony do not make any noise when the music is playing . i do not like noise when the music is playing . 46. close shot hollis as he blinks back the enveloping pressure of the alcohol , tosses a salute , smiles and reaches down for the bottle again . 47. close shot dad fremont who slowly turns back toward the piano , but in doing so throws a look at anthony , then over to his wile who stands there , hands clenched together in front of her as riley continues to play . 48. close shot hollis as he takes another drink , giggles a little bit , then looks down at his wife who has crossed over to stand close to him . her face is a mask of fear . etbel ( in a whisper ) dan ... dan please ... hollis please what ? I am not doing anything . I am just drinking this peach brandy . I am just drinking one of my birthday presents . that is all I am doing . there is a rustle and murmur in the room as eyes move from hollis to anthony , eyes that betray the cold , clammy nightmare that enfolds all of them . 49. two shot ethel and hollis again as she grabs the front of his coat .

I will have to send in to dayton for it . don how long will that take ? mechanic ( unhooking the car ) oh , three , four hours . better figure on four to play safe . a disappointed don leaves the mechanic and helps pat out of the car . pat ( to don ) four hours ? crazy . don let us get some lunch . pat lunch ? we can homestead . they start walking down the sidewalk hand in hand , searching for a place to eat . don and pat are in their twenties -- casually dressed , a nice-looking couple . pat ( playfully ) june , prune , honeymoon . don ( smiling ) quiet . pat ( mocking him ) quiet . don do not think i should phone the office again , huh ? pat you are going to lose that promotion if you keep pestering them , lover . don I am going to lose it anyway . pat ah , that is a fine way to talk . and i thought i married a man with confidence . and who is the best man for the job ? don me . but ... pat but ? don but thompson has seniority . pat ah . does not mean a thing . don little miss sunshine , hm ? pat ( all smiles ) that is me . he gives her a kiss on the cheek . they approach a lamp post . for a moment , it looks as if they will pass it on opposite sides , but don grabs pat 's hand and pulls her around to his side of the post , to avoid getting `` bad luck . '' don bread and butter . pat ( gently mocking him ) yes , dear . don just trying to save your life . they step off the curb and cross the street . pat points out a diner and the couple hurries to it . dissolve to : int . diner - day moments later , don and pat enter a little diner called the `` busy bee cafe .

( to pat ) honey , you got another quarter on you ? she nods , smiles , digs in her pocketbook for her change purse and brings him the money . pat ( teasing him ) is this call necessary ? don ( into the phone ) here you are , operator . he deposits the necessary amount . a moment of tension follows , and then : don ( into the phone ) hello ? connect me with mr. weldon 's secretary , please . ( to pat ) keep your fingers crossed . pat ( points to her head ) I am doing it up here . don ( into the phone ) hello ? hello , pauline ? it is don . fine . fine . and you ?

( more ) don ( cont 'd ) he really came through on that one . pat ( off her sandwich ) hmmm ... why do not you ask him why he did not warn us the whole wheat bread is stale ? printed on the front of the mystic seer are some suggested questions which don now studies . don ( reads aloud ) `` does he/she love me ? '' ( kisses pat 's cheek ) i know the answer to that one , hm ? ( reads aloud ) `` will i become rich ? '' ( to pat ) i know the answer to that one , too . I am going to be the world 's first millionaire accountant . pat ( corrects him ) office manager . don right . ( to the seer ) is it really going to be four hours before we get out of here ? don deposits a penny , pulls the lever and takes the card . don ( reads aloud ) `` you may never know .

'' ( laughs quietly , to pat ) what does that mean ? pat well , he is a mystic . what do you expect ? don starts to deposit another penny . pat i can see I am going to have to be the frugal one in our family . don ( to pat ) just one more . ( to the seer ) you mean that we are not supposed to move ? we are supposed to stay here ? pat ( imitates a phone operator ) just one question per penny , please . but don is taking this seriously . a little too seriously for pat who grows visibly uncomfortable over the next few minutes . don deposits a penny , pulls the lever and takes the card . don ( reads aloud ) `` that makes a good deal of sense . '' ( to the seer ) how long sh -- no , uh ... don checks his watch . it is almost 2:15. don ( to the seer ) should we stay here until two-thirty ? don deposits a penny , pulls the lever and takes the card . don ( reads aloud ) `` try again .

'' pat does not like where this is leading . pat don . let us take a look around the town , hm ? don every answer seems to fit . pat you are joking , am not you ? i mean -don starts to deposit another penny , but pat stops him . pat don , no more . but don gives her a look and deposits the penny anyway . don ( to the seer ) if we do not stay in here until three of the clock ... something bad will happen to us ? don pulls the lever , takes the card , and reads it to himself . pat oh , don , for heaven 's sakes . don ( hands pat the card ) read it . pat ( reads aloud ) `` do you dare risk finding out ? '' ( to don ) don , let us go . but , clearly , don does not want to leave . he quickly turns to his lunch . don i have not finished my sandwich yet . ( starts to eat ) do not you want some ice cream ? an awkward silence follows . don checks his watch . it is still a little before 2:15. dissolve to : int . diner - day the diner 's clock now reads four minutes to three . pat buys a pack of cigarettes from the diner 's vending machine . she smiles weakly at the counterman who seems to be wondering why she and don are loitering . in fact , she seems to be wondering the same thing herself . she crosses to don at the booth as he dawdles over a half-finished bowl of ice cream . pat ( to don ) can we go now ? don do not you want something cold to drink ? pat please , let us go . don looks first at the clock and then at the devil 's head , winking and grinning at him . don ( to pat ) all right . don kisses the rabbit 's foot on his key ring as he rises and goes to the counter . don ( to the counterman ) say , can i have my check ? counterman you do not need a check , i know what you had . two sandwiches , eighty cents . iced coffee , a dollar ten . two ice creams , a dollar sixty . with three cents tax . don ( hands over some bills ) here , keep the change . counterman thanks ! and come on back now . don joins pat at the door . they exit the diner . cut to : ext . street - day moments later , don and pat cross the street , walking hand in hand . don wipes his brow . pat hot , hot , hot . don yeah . pat maybe it will not take them four hours to fix the car , think ? don maybe . pat don , you did not really want to stay in there , did you ? don ( unconvincingly ) no . pat honest ? don well , why was it so specific ? pat specific ? sweetie ... they both stop , having crossed the street . don `` if you move soon .

I am not trying to upset you . pat i know you are not . don does not change the facts , though . pat what facts ? don six straight answers . pat oh , don , please . don oh , stop treating me like a retarded child or something . i did not make those answers up . a large truck is rolling slowly down the next street as don and pat step off the curb to cross . don pulls pat into the street figuring they can easily get across . pat oh , don , wait . don we can make it . but a speeding car suddenly passes the truck and nearly runs the couple down . don pulls pat to safety at the last moment . they fall against a parked car . on the sidewalk , townspeople murmur about the near accident . shaken , a relieved don and pat hug one another as don looks at the large clock over the main street jewelers : it is exactly three . dissolve to : ext . street - day don and pat regroup on a nearby park bench , moments later . don you all right ? quite a moment . pat if you had not pulled me out of the way of that car -- one squashed honeymoon . don come on . they rise and don leads her by the hand down the street . pat well , where 're we going now ? pat freezes when she sees they are heading back to the diner . pat we are not going back to that-don why not ? pat all right . i admit it was a ... strange coincidence . don if it was a coincidence , well , what are you worrying about us going back , then ? pat I am not . don so , stop worrying . just the same , you will admit that for a coincidence it was pretty far-fetched ? pat maybe . the honeymoon couple walk toward the diner , no longer hand in hand . fade out end of act one act two int . diner - day don and pat enter and head toward the table with the seer on it -- but stop dead in their tracks at the sight of something before them . pat seems quietly pleased but don looks pretty grim . two little old ladies sit at the table sipping sodas . pat ( ironic , to don ) well ! someone 's sitting in front of our mystic seer . don 's in no mood for irony . pat turns and walks over to the counter . she looks up to see that don still stares at the little old ladies . pat don ? a frustrated don turns to her stiffly . pat why do not you try this one ? or one of the others ? I am sure that-don joins her at the counter but keeps his eyes on the little old ladies . don and pat sit at the counter . don tries unsuccessfully to contain his frustration . pat don ? don ( still staring ) what ? pat well , look at me . don looks at her . pat well , you-you really do not think that ... that gizmo can foretell the future , do you ? don it foretold ours . pat how ? how did it ? the counterman arrives and brings them a couple of glasses of water . counterman oh , back already . what will you have ? don ( to pat ) honey ? pat oh , I will have some iced coffee , please . counterman ( to don ) how 'bout you ? don same . the counterman goes to fetch the drinks . pat turns to don . pat all right . how ? don when that car almost hit us it was three of the clock . exactly when that machine said . pat don . you said three of the clock . not the machine . you decided to sit in here as long as we did . you . oh , this is ridiculous . can not you see that you made up all the details -- and all that-that thing did was give back generalities ? don what are you getting so upset about ? pat you . that you could even consider the possibility that-don will you listen -- ? don and pat quiet down as the counterman arrives with the drinks . don ( quietly , to pat ) will you listen -- ? don suddenly sees that the little old ladies are getting up to leave . don ( to the counterman ) excuse me . counterman yes ? don can you give me some pennies ? counterman oh , sure . how many ? don ten . the counterman grabs a huge jar of pennies and counts them out as the little old ladies leave the table . don ( to pat ) come on . don rises from the counter and hurries to the now-vacated table . one of the old ladies pays the counterman and they exit the diner . pat brings the drinks from the counter to the table where don sits , having already deposited a penny , with his finger under the devil 's chin . unlike earlier , pat sits on the opposite side of the table from don . don ( to the seer ) did you know about the car almost hitting us ? don pulls the lever and takes the card . don ( reads aloud ) `` what do you think ? '' don looks at pat who looks away . don deposits another penny . don ( to the seer ) will we reach new york all right now ? don pulls the lever and takes the card . he reads it silently , sighs , and smiles at pat . don ( reads aloud ) `` your chances are good .

'' the counterman arrives and clears the table of the little old ladies ' soda glasses . counterman excuse me . the counterman leaves with the dirty glasses . don ( quietly , to pat ) i never said these slips we are made for us personally . i only said-pat i heard . ( tries to reason with him ) don . do not you realize that you could get the same kind of answers from any one of these machines in here ? try and see . don the same kind , maybe , but not the same answers . don deposits a penny . don ( to the seer ) will it still take four hours before the car is ready ? don pulls the lever and takes the card . he reads it silently , breaks into a broad grin , and shows it to pat . don hey . `` it has already been taken care of .

( off julia 's coat ) here , give me that . bob stows their coats in the overhead bin . bob and julia start to sit -- julia on the aisle , bob by the window . julia ( suddenly concerned ) do you want me to sit next to the window ? bob ( reassuring ) no . they sit . bob I am fine . i can sit -- bob sees that he is seated by the auxiliary exit and tenses up . julia honey , what is it ? the emergency window ? you want to move ? bob no , no , no . does not matter . what is the difference where i sit ? it is not the seat . it is the airplane . bob takes out a pack of cigarettes and starts to light up . julia notices the non-smoking sign is lit . julia honey , do not smoke that now . wait till the plane takes off . bob ( puts the cigarette away ) I am not acting much like a cured man , am i ? julia honey , you are cured . doctor martin would not let you fly if you were not , would he ? bob i suppose not . julia ( takes his arm ) i mean if you were not well , doctor martin just would not let you fly all the way back home . it is just that simple . bob well , you make it sound simple , anyway . julia it is , bob . bob yeah . here i am hogging the whole stage and you are so tired .

I am going to be all right . had a teensy weensy breakdown . now , I am cured . understanding -- it is wonderful . ( more ) bob ( cont 'd ) it is not the airplane at all . overtension and overanxiety due to underconfidence . the cabin lights dim as the stewardess makes a final walk down the aisle before take-off . stewardess ( to bob ) seat belt , sir . a very nervous bob buckles himself . he glances around uncertainly , turns on the little lights above his seat , offers a smile to julia , and tries to stay calm . narrator ( v.o . ) portrait of a frightened man : mr. robert wilson , thirty-seven , husband , father , and salesman on sick leave . mr. wilson has just been discharged from a sanitarium where he spent the last six months recovering from a nervous breakdown , the onset of which took place on an evening not dissimilar to this one , on an airliner very much like the one in which mr. wilson is about to be flown home ... a fast pan to the omniscient narrator , in suit and tie , standing beneath an airport direction sign that reads : `` terminal -- - > '' narrator ... the difference being that , on that evening half a year ago , mr. wilson 's flight was terminated by the onslaught of his mental breakdown . tonight , he is traveling all the way to his appointed destination which , contrary to mr. wilson 's plan , happens to be in the darkest corner of the twilight zone . fade out fade in on the unlit no smoking and fasten seat belt signs at the front of the airplane 's cabin . the seat belt sign pops on just as the stewardess enters through the cockpit door just beneath them . she closes the door behind her and smiles at a few of the passengers , working her way up the aisle , eyeing everyone carefully . stewardess ( to a passenger ) fasten your seat belt , sir . the stewardess approaches bob and julia . stewardess ( to a bob ) fasten your seat belt , sir . bob starts to fasten his seat belt . cut to : the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- lots of wind and rain and lightning and thunder . cut to : the cabin where bob tries to fasten julia 's seat belt while she sleeps , only to wake her . bob sorry , darling . go back to sleep . julia i should not 've taken that sleeping pill . i should stay awake with you . bob no , no , i do not want you to , sweetheart . go back to sleep . I am all right . julia can not you sleep ? bob i will . do not worry about me . julia okay . julia pulls her jacket over her and nods off while bob turns to his newspaper . he glances out the window which directly overlooks the wing of the plane . it is dark and rainy but two prop engines are clearly visible . as bob continues to stare , he spots something besides wind-swept rainwater moving on the wing . it looks like the figure of a man . an ape-like man skulking slowly across the wing . the wind ought to have blown this creature away , but it easily stands upright , unaffected by the weather or the airspeed . bob is wild-eyed in disbelief . he turns to julia twice , but she is asleep . he looks out the window . the creature squats and seems to be staring back at him , sort of taking an interest in bob , the way a man might take an interest in an animal locked up in a cage at the zoo . an alarmed bob starts looking around for the stewardess . she is nowhere to be seen . bob frantically pushes the button above his seat to summon her . he stops only to check that the creature on the wing is still there . it is . it watches bob with curiosity . the stewardess enters the cabin and bob beckons to her . bob here . quickly ! stewardess may i help you ? bob there is a man out there ! stewardess what ? bob look , look , he is crawling on -- bob turns back to the window . the creature is gone . bob 's eyes widen . he stares out the window for a long moment and then , turns apologetically to the stewardess just as julia wakes up . bob sorry . it must have been ... julia bob ? what is it ? stewardess ( to julia ) oh , it is nothing , mrs. wilson . ( to bob ) can i get you anything ? bob a glass of water . stewardess surely . the stewardess departs . julia rubs her eyes . bob stares out the window and tries to come to grips with what he is just seen . julia something wrong ? bob no . i-i thought i saw something out there . julia what ? bob realizes he can not tell her . she will think he is cracking up . he shakes his head . bob nothing . bob closes the window 's curtain to block his view of the wing . bob i guess i need a little sleep . julia are you all right ? bob yeah , fine . julia ( checks her watch ) do not you think you ought to take a sleeping pill now ? bob ( rubs his eyes ) yeah , i-I will take one of those , uh ... julia digs the pills out of her purse as the stewardess arrives with a paper cup of water . bob let us out his breath , trying to compose himself . stewardess here you are . bob thank you . stewardess you are welcome . can i get you a blanket ? bob no . ( to julia ) honey ? julia hands bob the sleeping pills . julia ( to the stewardess ) oh , no thanks . the stewardess leaves . bob swallows the pill and the entire cup of water . cut to : the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- more wind and rain and lightning and thunder . cut to : the airplane 's cabin , a little later , where julia is ready to go back to sleep . julia you will be all right now ? bob yeah , fine . julia will you wake me if you need me ? bob i will . julia shuts her eyes and dozes off . bob takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes . but they do not stay shut . the thing on the wing is still bothering him . he glances at julia . seeing that she is asleep , bob hesitantly lifts his hand to the window curtain . but he immediately lowers it , afraid of what he might see on the other side . after a long moment , he comes to a decision . very slowly , he reaches for the curtain . abruptly , he whips the curtain away to reveal the creature 's hideous face pressed against the glass , staring at bob curiously . bob freaks . he shuts his eyes , rears his head back , opens his mouth , and starts whispering to himself . bob it is not there . it is not there . bob opens his eyes but does not look at the window . bob ( weakly , to julia ) honey ? would you wake up , honey ? but she is fast asleep . bob sees the creature has not moved . panicking , bob sees the stewardess . bob ( gestures to the stewardess ) quickly ! while bob turns to the stewardess , the creature nonchalantly flies straight up and out of view . the stewardess arrives just as bob turns back to the window . stewardess yes , mr. wilson ? bob does not respond . he is staring out the window at the empty wing . stewardess can i help you , mr. wilson ? bob tries to regain his composure . bob are we going into a storm ? stewardess ( smiles ) just a small one . nothing to worry about . the stewardess walks off . bob shuts his eyes and tries to get a grip . bob ( to julia ) honey ? would you wake up please , honey ? as he says this , the creature flies down to the wing and lands just behind one of the engines . bob sees it as it lands and their eyes meet . bob watches and winces as the creature saunters forward , sits casually astride an engine , and pokes curiously at the rapidly spinning propellers with its fingers . the creature backs away from the propellers and begins to pry up a cowling plate that covers the engine . bob stares in horror as the creature easily pulls up the metal plate to reveal the hot , glowing engine underneath . as it does so , the creature shoots bob a glance . fade out on a terrified bob mouthing the word `` no . '' end of act one act two fade in on the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- still more wind and rain and lightning and thunder . cut to : bob trying to awaken julia . bob honey ... julia , wake up . julia awakes with a start . julia what ? bob turns to the window just in time to see the creature take off into the air . julia , of course , fails to see anything . julia what are you looking at ? bob ? is it the storm ? does it bother you ? bob no . honey , you remember what i told you before about seeing something outside ? julia yes . bob julia , there is a man out there . julia gives bob a blank , uncomprehending look . thunder roars . bob i-i do not mean a man , i mean ... i do not know what i mean . i mean , maybe a ... what 'd they call them during the war ? you know , the p-pilots ? gremlins ! gremlins . you remember the stories of the ... julia just stares at him . bob julia , do not look at me like that . julia bob ... bob i am not imagining it . I am not imagining it . he is out there . julia glances at the window . bob do not look . he is not there now . he ... ( realizes all too well how crazy this sounds ) he jumps away whenever anyone might see him . except me . honey , he is there . i realize what this sounds like . do i look insane ? julia no , darling , no . bob i know i had a mental breakdown . i know i had it in an airplane . i know it looks to you as if the same thing 's happening again , but it is not . I am sure it is not . look , the reason I am telling you this ... is not just to worry you . you notice i did not tell you before . julia well , i want you to tell me . bob i did not tell you before because i was not sure whether it was real or not . but i am sure now . it is real . there is a man out there . or a ... a gremlin , or ... whatever it ... ( almost laughs ) ( more ) bob ( cont 'd ) if i described him to you , you would really think i was gone . julia ( already thinks he is gone ) no , darling , it is all right . it is all right . bob julia , i know your intentions are good . i know you love me . and sympathize with me . but do not patronize me . i am not insane . julia did i say -- ? bob does it have to be said ? it is in your face , in your -- look , for the last time , that creature 's out there . and the reason I am telling you is , he is starting to tamper with one of the engines . look , look . look . think anything you want . think i belong in a straitjacket , if it pleases you . julia if it pleases me ! ? bob no , no , i-i-i-i did not mean that . what i mean is , whatever you think of me -- that I am losing my mind , anything -- all I am asking you to do is to tell the pilots what I have said . ask them to keep an eye on the wings . if they see nothing ... all right . all right , then I will ... commit myself . but if they do ... julia tries very hard not to look at bob as if he we are a madman . bob will not you even allow the possibility -- ? julia I will tell them . bob i know it is asking a lot . i -- i-iit 's like asking you to ... advertise your marriage to a lunatic . julia no , I will tell them . you just sit tight and I will go tell them . julia unbuckles her seat , rises , heads down the aisle to the cockpit door , and urgently knocks . the stewardess rushes to her from the rear of the plane . stewardess mrs. wilson , what is the problem ? may i help you ? julia oh-oh , yes , my husband wants to see the flight engineer . stewardess all right , if you will stay right here , I will have him see you . julia oh , thank you , it is very important . still in his seat , bob glances out the window just as the gremlin lands on the wing . julia ( to the stewardess ) hurry , please . bob watches the creature as it reaches to pry up the cowling plate again . bob ( to julia ) hurry ! hurry ! the flight engineer stands talking with julia at the cockpit door . he rushes over to bob . julia follows . bob ( to the flight engineer ) he is out there ! flight engineer what is going on ? bob he is pulling up one of the cowling plates . flight engineer he ? bob did not my wife -- ? there is a man out there ! flight engineer listen , keep your voice down . bob I am sorry , I am sorry , i-i-i-flight engineer i do not know what is going on here . bob will you look ? flight engineer mr. wilson , I am warning you . bob will you please look ? in the name of -bob , julia and the flight engineer all peer out the window at the empty wing . the cowling plate appears untouched . a long pause . flight engineer well ? bob oh , now wait a minute . i saw him pull that plate up ... . julia and the flight engineer just look at bob with blank stares . bob ( insistent ) i said , i saw him pull that plate up . flight engineer mr. wilson , please . all right , you saw him , but there are other people aboard . we must not alarm them . bob ( surprised ) you mean you have seen him too ? flight engineer of course we have . but we do not want to frighten the passengers . you can understand that ? bob of course ... ( bob suddenly realizes he is being humored ) i understand . flight engineer now , the thing we got ta remember ... bob ( darkly ) you can stop now . julia bob ! flight engineer sir ... bob get out of here . flight engineer mr. wilson ... bob i said , you can stop . julia honey , what is it ? bob ( turns away from them ) i will not say another word . I will see us crash first . julia bob ! flight engineer mr. wilson , try to understand our position . julia honey , I will be right back . julia and the flight engineer head to the back of the plane , leaving bob to bang his fists into his temples . bob ( whispers to himself ) he did pull it up . he did . in the rear of the cabin , the flight engineer hands julia some pills -- sedatives . meanwhile , bob watches as , once again , the gremlin pulls up the cowling plate . bob looks back at julia , realizes he can not say anything , and pounds his fist into his chair . julia starts to walk back down the aisle to bob . bob turns back to the window to see the gremlin , on cue , playfully stick out its arms and fly away . julia sits down next to bob . julia honey , i was going to tell them when you-bob we are you ? julia hands bob the sedative and a cup of water . bob for me ? julia please , bob . bob puts the pill in his mouth and drinks the water . julia you will sleep -- you will sleep now , darling . hm ? bob sure . the two of them lean back in their chairs and an uneasy silence ensues . bob closes his eyes . a deeply concerned julia gazes at him . the flight engineer makes his way down the aisle and confers with the stewardess . flight engineer oh , boy . stewardess what 'd you do ? get his wife to give him one of those pills ? flight engineer he will be out for hours . stewardess well , i hope so , the way the storm 's coming up . flight engineer do not worry , betty , everything 's fine . stewardess i hope so . the stewardess heads for the rear . the flight engineer heads for the cockpit . julia sleeps . bob sleeps . ah , but he only appears to sleep . he opens his eyes and looks out the window . nothing . he puts his hand to his mouth and removes the unswallowed sedative from his cheek -- just as the gremlin flies down to the wing . bob reacts by throwing the sedative on the floor in disgust . the gremlin immediately pries up the cowling plate and starts tinkering with the engine . bob looks around the cabin helplessly . suddenly , his eye falls on the holstered gun of the policeman , who sleeps in an aisle seat , a few rows behind bob . bob formulates a plan . he unbuckles his seat belt , rises , and slowly walks down the aisle toward the sleeping policeman , clearly intending to steal the gun . but before bob can reach the seat , the policeman shifts his arm , covering the holster . bob backs off , turns , and pulls out his pack of cigarettes . the policeman moves his arm off the gun and bob makes his move . pretending to drop the cigarettes in the aisle next to the policeman , bob kneels down and recovers the pack , then gently lifts the gun out of the holster , and hides it in his jacket . quickly returning to his seat , bob draws the gun , and then stops . the gremlin continues its interminable sabotage operation on the engine . bob realizes he can not shoot through the plane window . he sees the auxiliary exit handle and knows he must open the door to get a clear shot . he pockets the weapon and buckles himself in . he is about to draw the gun when he thinks of julia 's safety . bob honey ? honey , would you get me a glass of water , please ? julia wakes up with a start , surprised to find bob wide awake . bob a glass of water . please ? hurry . without a word , a confused julia heads for the rear of the plane and talks with the stewardess . seeing that she is safely in the rear of the plane , bob draws the gun , releases its safety catch , removes the plastic guard from the auxiliary exit handle , takes one last look around , notes the location of the gremlin -- still leaning over the engine -- and , steeling himself , releases the emergency door . the door flies off instantly and bob is nearly sucked out , his seat belt barely securing him to the plane . julia , the stewardess , and everybody else in the cabin start screaming . bob , in excruciating pain -- half in his seat and halfway out the door -- is pressed against the outside of the airplane by the tremendous wind , trying to get a two-fisted grip on the gun and bring it to bear on the gremlin . the startled creature stands a few feet away and starts walking toward bob . slowly , bob struggles to aim the weapon . the creature is closing in . with a herculean effort , bob aims and fires , emptying the gun into the gremlin . it topples backward onto the wing . after the sixth shot , bob let us go of the gun and screams . cut to : the inside of the nearly empty cabin , sometime later that night . all is quiet . the policeman puts his hat on . a peaceful , smiling bob , straitjacketed and strapped to a stretcher , is carried down the aisle and out of the plane by two attendants . cut to : an airport runway at night , seconds later . the plane is on the ground . the storm is over . the policeman silently leads the stretcher-bearers and julia off the plane to a waiting ambulance and police car . the police radio chatters . the flight engineer and the stewardess watch the preparations to load bob into the ambulance . flight engineer ( to the stewardess ) nuttiest way of trying to commit suicide I have ever heard of . julia stands over the stretcher , comforting bob . julia ( to bob ) it is all right now , darling . a triumphant bob struggles to sit upright . bob i know . but I am the only one who does know ... right now . tired but happy , bob lies back down . the attendants lift him into the ambulance . narrator ( v.o . ) the flight of mr. robert wilson has ended now , a flight not only from point a to point b , but also from the fear of recurring mental breakdown . mr. wilson has that fear no longer ... slow pan from the ambulance to the plane 's wing , where the pried-up cowling plate is plainly visible . narrator ( v.o . ) ... though , for the moment , he is , as he has said , alone in this assurance . happily , his conviction will not remain isolated too much longer , for happily , tangible manifestation is very often left as evidence of trespass , even from so intangible a quarter as the twilight zone . fade out

( touches her face ) people said I would spoil my fine complexion . i did not care . i loved outdoor things . i lived out in the sunlight . wanda looks down and sees that , beside her on the floor , a small patch of sunlight has found its way through her boarded up windows . she reaches out and puts her hand in its warmth . wanda I have always hated the dark and the cold . I am old . I have lived a long time . but i do not want to die . ( more ) wanda ( cont 'd ) I would rather live in the dark than not live at all . belden leans forward to hand her his empty teacup and winces in pain . belden here . there is nothing to be afraid of . we are alone here . and there is nobody at the door . you need some rest-the pain becomes too much for him and he leans back in his bed . belden and i need help . at a loss as to what to do , wanda rises and walks away from him , wringing her hands . she closes a cabinet door , sits on a table , and paces nervously about . suddenly , her attention is drawn to something outside a window . a burly man is walking down the stairs to her door . he knocks . belden gives wanda a look , but she is paralyzed with fear , clutching her bed frame , and shaking her head . the knocking continues throughout . wanda no . belden there is nothing to be afraid of . you would better answer it . wanda moves slowly to the door . belden go on . that is right . go ahead . go ahead , answer it . wanda leaves the chain on , but opens the door a crack . the burly man 's face appears . he tries to push the door in . man I am sorry , lady , but I have got my orders . wanda panics and tries to slam the door shut , but the man gets his foot in . man i can not fool around any longer . he is too strong for her . the chain breaks and he forces the door in and wanda collapses to the floor . she lies completely still . is she unconscious ? dead ? the man moves to her body at once and places his hand on her neck . fade out on the image of the man 's hand is this the touch of death ? end of act one act two fade in on the man standing over wanda , minutes later . she is in her bed now . and the man is rubbing her hand as she regains consciousness . man easy , lady . just lie quiet till you get your strength back . you gave me quite a scare when you caved in like that . wanda stares at the man 's face and then at her hand in his . wanda and still i live . man well ... you have got to understand , madam . ii do not get no pleasure out of bustin ' in doors . you do not seem to realize how important this is . I have got a crew and equipment coming in an hour to pull this tenement down . beggin ' your pardon , madam , but it is long overdue . i-I am surprised it is still standing . wanda and you are really ... not mister death ? man i do not know what you are talking about . all i know is i got a contract to demolish this row of buildings . everybody else moved out long ago . until the other day , i thought this building was deserted . i-i seen them windows boarded up and i-i figured you moved when the rest of them did . wanda you want me to go outside ? you want me to leave here ? i can not . man you we are notified months ago , right ? I am just trying to do my job . these buildings we are condemned by the city and I am the one ( more ) man ( cont 'd ) who is got to tear them down . wanda how can you ? man this building has had it . it is worn out . used up . all these buildings have got to come down . wanda clutches the bars of her bed frame in a way that suggests she is trapped in a cage . man i have not a monster , lady . I have got a heart just like anybody else , but , uh -- i can see how you could get attached to a place and not want to see it wrecked but when a building is old , it is dangerous . it is got ta come down to make room for a new one . that is life , lady . old make room for the new . people get the idea that I am some kind of destroyer but -- they think i get kicks out of , uh , tearing stuff down . that have not the way it is . i just clear the ground so that other people can build . in a way , i help them do it . look around , it is the way things are . a big tree falls and new ones grow right out of the same ground . old animals die and young ones take their places . even people step aside when it is time . wanda i will not . wanda suddenly notices that her door is wide open . wanda the door ! she rises at once and shuts it . the man confronts her . man there is no need in ... wanda turns from him and presses herself against the door . man what is the sense of locking a door that will not even be here in an hour ? if you have got any possessions you would want to keep , ii 'd move them out . I will help ya . wanda turns to glare at him . man now , look , I have been trying to go easy but if you insist on staying here , I will have to call a cop . please cooperate , lady . the mention of the police reminds wanda of something . she leaves the door and crosses halfway to the mysteriously silent belden , still lying in bed on the other side of the room . wanda ( to herself ) of course . ( to belden ) explain to him . tell him the reason i can not go out there . you will help me , will not you ? belden merely looks at her , saying nothing . the man joins wanda in the middle of the room and stares right at belden , but is somehow unable to see him . man ( to wanda ) what are you doing ? who 're you talking to ? wanda ( to the man ) mister belden is a policeman . ( to belden ) please tell him . but belden remains silent . and the man sees no one . the man looks at wanda as if she is crazy . man ( to wanda ) I am sorry , but if you are still here when the crew arrives , i-I will have to call a cop . the man crosses to the door , opens it , pauses to look back sympathetically at wanda , then exits , leaving the door wide open . wanda watches him go , then turns to belden . wanda why did not you help me ? she hurriedly crosses to the door . wanda i thought you understood . she shuts the door and , as she does so , it begins to dawn on her . she turns back to belden . wanda you . he looked right at you ... and did not see you . ( full realization ) no ! belden look in the mirror , wanda . wanda turns , walks to the ornate mirror , and looks . in the mirror , belden 's bed is empty . she turns quickly to see -and a fast pan reveals -- belden still lying in the bed . wanda you tricked me ! it was you all the time . belden yes . i tricked you . wanda but why ? the moment i let you inside , you could have taken me . anytime . but you we are nice . you made me trust you . slowly , belden sits up in bed , no longer in pain . belden but i had to make you understand . am i really so bad ? am i really so frightening ? you have talked to me . you have confided in me . have i tried to hurt you ? belden rises . belden it is not me you are afraid of . you understand me . what you are afraid of is the unknown . do not . do not be afraid . wanda but i am afraid . belden takes a step toward wanda . belden the running 's over . it is time to rest . ( offers his hand ) give me your hand . wanda i do not want to die . belden trust me . wanda no . no . belden ( gently ) mother ... ( steps forward ) give me your hand . an odd expression crosses wanda 's face . very slowly , she takes his hand . belden smiles . belden you see ? no shock . no engulfment . no tearing asunder . what you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper . what you thought was the end is the beginning . wanda when will it happen ? when will we go ? belden go ? look . he nods toward her bed . she turns and sees ... her body lying on the mattress , a peaceful smile on its face . she turns back to belden and grins . belden we have already begun . belden opens the door and leads wanda to the doorway . the room magically darkens behind them as belden offers wanda his arm and she takes it . they walk into the sunshine , up the stairs , and down the street , chatting amiably . narrator ( voice over ) there was an old woman who lived in a room and , like all of us , was frightened of the dark . but who discovered in the minute last fragment of her life that there was nothing in the dark that was not there when the lights we are on . object lesson for the more frightened amongst us -- in or out of the twilight zone . pan up and dissolve to to a field of stars in a night sky and fade out .
5|Twilight Zone|One for the Angels|October 9, 1959|102 : `` one for the angels '' written by rod serling act one ext . sky [ night ] shot of the sky ... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp , sparkling relief . as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens -narrator 's voice there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man . it is a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity . it is the middle ground between light and shadow -- between science and superstition , and it lies between the pit of man 's fears and the summit of his knowledge . this is the dimension of imagination . it is an area which we call the twilight zone . the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot ( each week the opening shot of the play ) ext . city street [ day ] long angle shot looking down at lew bookman -- dumpy , shabby little man in a mangled seersucker suit , the pants too short and the coat too long . a flamboyant tie askew at the neck with a misshapen knot and a summer pork pie hat tilted rakishly and idiotically at an angle on his head -- these set off the odd , bizarre quality of the little man . he has a pitch stand set up in front of him with perhaps two dozen items -- everything from toys to needles and thread , cheap ties , can openers , radio tubes , et al . it is a sweltering july afternoon and lew goes through a half-hearted , stumbling pitch that attracts no one . lew here you are , ladies and gentlemen ... nice things for the home ... wearing apparel , toys ... everything . special july clean-up sale ! long angle shot looking down on lew as he continues to talk . over this tableau we hear the narrator 's voice . narrator 's voice street scene ... summer ... the present . man on a sidewalk -- age , sixtyish ; occupation -- pitchman . name -- lew bookman . a fixture of the summer . a rather minor component to a hot july . a nondescript , commonplace little man whose life is a treadmill built out of sidewalks . ( a pause ) lew bookman -- a walking rebuttal to the american dream that states that success can be carved , gouged , and grubbed out of log cabins and tenements . because lew bookman has not even a nodding acquaintance with success , and his dreams only extend from the curb to the sidewalk . a pause . long angle shot looking down on lew as he calls forlornly to a couple more passersby and then just seems to give up and stands there , close-mouthed , head half down . suddenly , instinctively , he looks up . cut to : long shot of him from behind . a dark-coated man stands there staring at him . the man turns so that his profile is in the f.g. he is staring down at a small ledger that he carries in his hand . bookman looks at him interestedly and a little warily . narrator 's voice but in just a moment lew bookman will have something to occupy his time which transcends both success and failure . he will have to concern himself with survival . because as of three of the clock this hot july , ( more ) narrator 's voice ( cont 'd ) mr. bookman will be stalked by mr. death ! dissolve to : opening billboard first commercial fade on : ext . street [ day ] lew stands silently by his pitch stand , heaves a couple of extremely deep sighs and then slowly begins to close up the pitch , automatically putting things in their places , retrieving samples and buttoning the whole thing up . every now and then he rather compulsively looks up to see the man in the dark suit staring at him . finally he has the whole pitch , buttoned down . he hoists it under his arm and starts to walk . just once he turns back to look at the man and then continues on his way . ext . tenement street [ day ] typical east side , flanked by brownstones on either side , pitch carts , children playing by hydrants , and a hot populace sitting oh curbstones fanning themselves . track shot lew as he walks down the sidewalk . on several occasions children wave and call to him . a few of them follow him to the front stoop . children 's voices hi , lew . how you doing ' , lew ? how did she go today , lew ? lew responds to every call . on occasion he will stop , cupping a child 's face in his hands . the overwhelming sense of all these actions and this interplay is a fabulous rapport between the little pitchman and the children . med . close shot front stoop brownstone a little girl , age seven , sits-on the stoop playing . she runs excitedly toward lew when she sees him . he swoops her into his arms , hugs her tightly then puts her down then he sits down on the steps . the children crowd around him , the little girl in the f.g. little girl what you sellin ' today , lew ? toys , lew ? we are you sellin ' toys ? lew holds up a finger in a gesture of extravagant , mysterious silence . he opens the satchel and takes out a little wind-up toy man , hands one to the child , there are 'oohs ' and 'aahs ' from the kids . lew now ! you know what they are ? little girl toys , lew , huh ? little boy you wind 'em up , don'cha ? lew they may look like toys . ( he shakes his head pontifically and holds up a protesting hand ) but they are not just toys , just toys anyone can sell . you can go to the five and dime and get just toys . these are not just toys . these , my young friends , are the toy wonders of the world . little girl ( wide-eyed ) go ahead , lew . give us the pitch . lew ( clears his throat , looks down at the starry-eyed kids and the words come easily , effectively , with import and meaning ) young ladies and gentlemen , the toys you now hold in your hand come from a remote corner of the mysterious tibetan mountain ( more ) lew ( cont 'd ) country . they are patterned , shaped and forged by strange little men who work underground . and in their final operation -little girl ( unable to hold back , blurts out ) they are subject to the strange life force ! little boy aw , come on -- let lew tell it . lew ( laughs , hugs them both to him ) you both know it by heart . ( then he rises very slowly ) bookman social and ice cream hour after supper at the usual time . do not forget . he winks and waves again . track shot lew he continues up the steps and into the foyer . int . foyer [ day ] lew as he starts up the steps different angles looking down about five flights of staircases as lew trudges up toward the top , lugging his satchel . cut to : int . lew 's room [ day ] there is the sound of the key turning , then the door opens and lew enters . he goes directly over to the window and opens the rather threadbare curtains , then humming a little song , he crosses the room to the sink . the room is a combination living room , kitchen and everything else . he fills a small watering can in the sink then takes it over to a row of flowers that bloom heroically on the windowsill . still humming , he puts the can down , starts to take off his coat and in the process of turning , sees the man in the dark suit sitting in a chair looking at him . close shot lew reacting two shot the two men lew you are the man from the sidewalk . i saw you today writing things in your book . he cranes his neck to look over on the man 's lap . sure enough , the little ledger book is in sight . stranger you are lew bookman , am not you ? lew that is right . lewis j , bookman . something i can show you ? ( and then in a kind of halfhearted hope ) something in collar stays , maybe ? stranger mr. bookman -- I am not here to buy anything . lew hunches down on a kitchen chair . his fingertips nervously run up and down together . stranger ( looks down at his ledger ) now let us get to business , shall we ? lewis j. bookman , age sixty-nine , right ? lew seventy in september . stranger occupation , pitchman . right ? lew ( nods ) that is right . are you a census taker ? stranger ( disregarding him ) born in new york city , 1890 ? lew that is right . 1890. stranger father , jacob bookman , mother flora bookman . father 's place of birth , detroit , michigan . mother 's place of birth , syracuse ; new york . right ? lew ( rises , peers over toward the other man ) that is right . my , you have it all down . stranger ( nods , bored ) we have to keep these things efficient . now today is - ( he talks as he writes ) -- the 19th of july . and your departure is at midnight tonight . lew my departure . at this moment we hear the sound of running footsteps up various flights of stairs , then a knock on lew 's door . lew excuse me . he opens the door . the little girl stands there . lew hi , maggie . little girl ( holds up the toy ) the key 's bent , lew . can you fix it ? lew ( takes the toy , studies it ) here 's your trouble right here . see this little cog wheel ? you have pushed down on the key when you have been winding it . the two of them bend over the toy . lew ( looks up at the man ) I would introduce you two , only i do not know your name . stranger ( smiles ) no need . little girl i think i got it now , lew . he stands there , intent on the toy . lew this gentleman here has come to ask me a lot of questions . ( and then as a frightened afterthought ) you are not the police , are you ? stranger ( shakes his head ) hardly . lew ( to the little girl ) kind of gave me a turn . I am glad he is not the police . I have got my vendor 's license here someplace . i thought maybe I would forgot to renew it or something . little girl ( still intent on the toy ) who is the police , lew ? lew this gentleman here . little girl ( looks up briefly ) what gentleman ? lew ( points to the chair ) that gentleman . cut to : close shot the girl cut to : shot of the chair girl 's p.o.v . it is empty . cut to : close shot the girl little girl what gentleman ? cut to : close shot lew as he looks . cut to : close shot the man in the chair lew 's p.o.v . stranger mr. bookman , she can not see me or hear me . med . shot lew ( looking from the man to the girl ) why not ? little girl why not what , lew ? lew why can not you hear him or see him ? little girl see who , lew ? ( and then delighted that the toy is fixed ) it works great now , lew . thanks an awful lot . see you after supper , huh ? she starts toward the door . lew wait a minute . what about our manners . am not you going to say goodbye ? little girl ( at door ) oh , yeah ! good-bye , lew . thanks a lot . lew i mean to the gentleman . little girl ( looks toward empty chair , laughs ) oh , it is a game ! the invisible man . goodbye , invisible man . see you after supper , lew . with this she gambols out of the apartment and we hear her running footsteps , two at a time ; down the stairs . lew closes the door very , very thoughtfully and turns toward the man . lew ( very hesitantly ) i can see you ... yet she can not . stranger only those who are to accompany me can see me . understand , mr. bookman . ( and then pointedly ) ( more ) stranger ( cont 'd ) only those who are to accompany me can see me ! ( a pause ) now do not you think you would better start making your arrangements ? lew ( softly ) arrangements for what ? stranger for your departure . lew my departure where ? stranger ( rises , staring at him ) you still do not get it ! ( he takes a deep breath ) i just never will understand you people . you get this idiotic notion that life goes on forever , and of course it does not . everyone has to go sometime . lew go ? you mean -stranger ( nods , walking around the room , surveying things ) that is right . he stops and looks down at the flowers on the windowsill . lew i won second prize last year at the ymha flower show . wisteria , open class . stranger how nice . ( he turns and looks at lew ) and what i further do not understand is how little you appreciate the nature of your departure . ( more ) stranger ( cont 'd ) think of the poor souls who go in violent accidents . these are the non- precognition victims . we are not permitted to forewarn them . you , mr. bookman , fall into the category of - ( he clears his throat ) natural causes . lew ( takes a step toward him ) natural causes ? ( he points a slightly wavering finger at the stranger ) i find you a very devious sort . this is not to say dishonest . why do not you say what you mean ? stranger mr. bookman , i have done everything but phone your own undertaker . how much clearer do you want it ? if you still do not know who i am - ( he turns toward the flowers ) then you are the most dense man I have come up against . closer shot stranger as he touches one of the flowers . it wilts under his touch , falls forward on its stem and dies . extremely tight close shot the flower the camera pans up for a shot of lew as he reacts . lew you are ... death ? stranger ( another deep sigh ) exactly , mr. bookman . now shall we get down to business ? time of departure is midnight tonight . i trust that will suit you . ( more ) stranger ( cont 'd ) the preordination is for death during nap . i presume this too will meet with your approval . you will find this a relatively simple and painless and barely noticeable -close shot lew nervous fingers beat a tattoo all over his face and finally he shouts . lew please ! i do not want to go ! two shot stranger ( to himself ) they never do . lew but i can not go yet . there is nothing wrong with me . I am a healthy man . outside of a cold last winter and an infected sliver , i do not think I have been sick a day in the past twenty years . stranger that is as it may be , but departure time is set for midnight and departure time will be at midnight . lew do not i have anything to say about that ? stranger we do listen to appeals . ( he opens the ledger ) but frankly , mr. bookman , i must tell you quite frankly that there is very little here in the way of an extenuating circumstance . there are three major categories of appeals . one is hardship cases . now do you have a wife or family who might suffer your ( more ) stranger ( cont 'd ) demise beyond a reasonable point ? lew ( shakes his head ) no , no family . stranger second category is priority cases . statesmen , scientists . men on the verge of discoveries . ( he looks up at lew then over to the pitchman 's satchel ) i take is you are not working on any major scientific pursuit at the moment . lew ( in a whisper ) no , I am not . ( then after a pause ) what about the third category ? stranger well , mr. bookman , that would be unfinished business of a major nature . lew ( turns to look at the stranger ) I have never made a truly successful pitch . i mean ... i mean a big pitch . i mean a pitch so big the sky will open up . ( and then with intensity ) a pitch for the angels . ( a pause ) i guess that would not mean much to you . ( he turns away again ) but it would mean a great deal to me . it would mean ... it would mean that - ( his face is very soft now and reflective ) i could have one moment in my whole life when i was successful at something . just one moment when the children would be able ( more ) lew ( cont 'd ) to ... would be able to feel proud of me . stranger ( displaying no emotions at all ) the children ? lew ( nods , his face suddenly carries with it a peculiar brightness ) I have always had rather a fondness for children . close shot stranger stranger ( dispassionately ) that is in the record here . ( then there is barely a perceptible softening of his face as he stares intently at lew ) problem here , mr. bookman , is that you would require a delay until -two shot lew and stranger lew until i could make a pitch . i mean the kind of pitch i told you about . stranger ( with a half-smile ) one for the angels , you mean ? ( there is a brief pause ) I am terribly sorry , mr. bookman ... you see these categories are fairly specific and when reference is made to unfinished business of a major nature , well the only interpretation to be made here is simply that ... what i mean is that unfortunately , mr. bookman , the ability to achieve success in a given professional venture is really ( more ) stranger ( cont 'd ) hardly of a major -he stops abruptly , suddenly conscious of the face of lewis j. bookman . suddenly aware of the poignance of it , the pathos of it , the infinite sadness , and with it the infinite gentleness and kindness . the stranger clears his throat , looks away , drums with his fingers on the ledger , then looks back at bookman . stranger mean a great deal to you , does it ? lew ( intensely ) a great deal . stranger uh huh . ( purses his lips , drums again with his fingers , walks over to the window then turns back to lew ) all right , mr. bookman . under the circumstances i believe we could grant you a delay . lew until ? stranger ( pettishly ) what do you mean , `` until ? '' until you have made this ... this `` pitch '' you are talking about . lew i can stay alive until then ? stranger that is the arrangement . close shot lew as his eyes narrow and a very wise , rather cat-got-canary look covers his face . then he smiles . lew i think that is a fine bargain . it is been awfully nice talking to you ... mr ... i did not get your name . he opens the door and motions . two shot stranger ( heading toward the door ) now about this pitch , mr. bookman . when might we expect it ? lew when ? ( he giggles ) oh , soon . soon . maybe not this year . maybe not next year , but soon . close shot stranger by the door . stranger mr. bookman , i have a very odd feeling that you are taking advantage of us . lew do you really ? well now that is a pity . ( then he giggles again and slams the door shut and shouts ) because i am ! ( he turns from the door and rubs his hands together ) i just will not make any pitches at all . i will not even hardly open my mouth . ( he strides over toward the windowsill ) think you will get me , huh ? well , i just will not -he stops dead , staring toward the mirror over the sink . there , he sees the reflection of the stranger back in the room . stranger really , mr. bookman , this is much more serious than you imagine -lew goes to the door in a rush , flings it open and hurries out , starting down the steps . cut to : first landing the stranger stands there and waggles a reproving finger at lew as he passes him . stranger it is much more complex than you realize -what you have just done . lew keeps going past him , shutting his eyes in the hopes that perhaps he will disappear . cut to : another landing as lew comes down . the stranger stands here too . stranger here we have gone out of our way to help you and this is the way you repay us -lew takes a long , shuddering breath as he waves the stranger off , going past him down the steps . cut to : foyer angle shot looking up the steps as lew comes down . the stranger steps out into the frame , his back to the camera and facing lew . stranger mr. bookman , it will not just end here , you understand . there 'll be consequences , you see ! close shot lew as he wiggles his head back and forth in a gesture of disdain , points a wavery finger at the man , his voice fairly dripping with contempt and with power . lew fyi ! that means , for your information -you have made your bed and you shall now sleep in it ! you say i will not go until i make the pitch -- well all right ! you will have to wait till i make the pitch ! and young man ... this i can say to you without fear of contradiction -- you have got a long wait ! close shot the stranger his eyes narrow thoughtfully . stranger that may well be , mr. bookman . but since you will not come with me -- we have been forced to select an alternative ! at this moment there is the sound of shrieking brakes from outside . a woman 's scream . and then a jumble of excited , frightened , horrified voices . lew turns , pushes open the front door . the camera follows him outside . ext . street moving shot behind lew as he pushes his way through the crowd and finally reaches a little knot of people on the curb . they part for him and reveal the body of the little girl lying on a blanket on the sidewalk . the truck driver , in a leather jacket , kneels beside her then looks up , wringing his hands . truck driver i swear i did not see her . she just jumps off the curb and i did not have no chance to stop ! i swear to you , i never had no chance to stop ! lew has someone gone for the doctor ? the ambulance coming ? there is a chorus of assent . close shot little girl as lew bends down by her . he pushes a wisp of hair off the tortured little face and kisses her cheek . lew you are going to be all right , maggie , darlin ' . you are going to be just fine . the little girl opens her eyes , smiles wanly . little girl hi , lew ! then her eyes travel past lew as a shadow crosses over her face . she looks a little frightened . little girl lew ? lew , who is that man ? close shot lew as his face turns . angle shot over lew 's shoulder looking toward the stranger who stands over them . close shot lew reacting , his eyes wide with horror . med . close shot lew as he rises . lew ( in a voice that trembles with intensity ) you can not take her . no siree -- you can not take her ! I will go . I will go as planned . ( more ) lew ( cont 'd ) never mind the pitch . I will go right now . i do not want to wait , even . i want to go right now ! long angle shot looking down the sidewalk as lew races in one direction , shouting . cut to : long shot looking down the sidewalk as he turns and races toward the camera . cut to : long shot from the top of the steps as lew races up them until the camera is extremely tight on him . lew ( shouts ) mr. death ? mr. death -- I will go . you must not take the little girl . i'ii go . please , mr. death . fade to black : end act one act two fade on : ext . building [ night ] long shot looking toward the front stoop through the open door into the foyer we see several neighbors crowded around the little girl 's apartment door . somber , waiting , silent people . a doctor comes out , putting his sleeves down , walks through the neighbors . we hear hushed questions . voices how is she ? is she going to be all right , doc ? how does the little girl , doc ? the doctor continues through the crowd outdoors to the front stoop where lew stands waiting . lew doctor ? doctor ( takes out a cigarette , lights it , inhales deeply ) i do not know . she is a mightily sick little girl . but we will know by midnight . i think she will hit a crisis by then . lew ( looks up at him ) by midnight ? doctor ( nods ) i think by then . close shot lew his features look set , grim . lew he will not come in ! i will not let him come in ! dissolve to : int . polansky apartment [ night ] the little girl , maggie , in bed beside the window . she is unconscious . a cheap alarm clock , in on the table beside the bed , reading : 11:40. ext . building [ night ] long angle shot looking down on the front stoop . it is very late now . lew sits there , a long figure guarding the front door . alongside of him is his pitch stand . he looks at his watch and intermittently scans the street . long shot looking at the sidewalk as suddenly the light from the street lamp is momentarily eclipsed by a big black shadow . close shot lew reacting . he looks up and across the street . long shot across the street out of the shadows and into the periphery of light around the street lamp comes the stranger . he walks very slowly across the street to stand a few feet away from lew . lew looks up . lew you got business in there ? stranger ( nods ) i most certainly do . ( he takes out a pocket watch , snaps it open , looks at it , snaps it shut , puts it back in his pocket ) it is a quarter to twelve . in fifteen minutes . midnight . that is my appointment . lew mr. death ... the little girl is only six years old . ( more ) ( cont 'd ) ( and now a hysteria creeps into his voice . he takes a step down toward the stranger ) please ... I am ready now . stranger ( firmly but not urgently ) I am sorry , mr. bookman . we had to make other arrangements . it is impossible to change it now . she is to come with me at midnight . ( he makes a gesture resigned , hopeless ) so i must be in there at midnight . close shot lew his features work . his voice is strained and tight . lew and if you are not in there by midnight ? stranger ( with a short laugh ) that would be pretty much unheard of . if i did not get there at precisely midnight then the whole timetable would be upset . oh my , no ... it is unheard of . full shot the steps as lew starts to very slowly walk back up toward his pitch stand , picks it up , carries it down to the sidewalk , opens it up and starts to arrange the merchandise . stranger what are you doing , mr. bookman ? lew ( over his shoulder ) what am i doing ? oh , nothing . just setting up a pitch is all . stranger at this time of night ? lew oh , i very often have a late-night sale . very often . stranger ( looks up and down the street ) not many customers . lew ( again over his shoulder ) they come ! they show up .

I am a mannequin . and it was my turn to— 115. close shot the woman smiling very contentedly now . woman your turn to leave us for a month . becoming much clearer now , isn ‘ t it ? you left us for a month and lived with the outsiders . but you we are due back yesterday and you did not show up . ( gently reproving now ) and you know , marsha , that is selfish , my dear . all of us wait our turn and we simply do not over-stay it . it was my turn starting last night . i ‘ m one day delayed already .

( a pause ) but it makes you wonder , does not it ? just how normal are we ? just who are the people we nod our hellos to as we pass on the street . a rather good question to ask ... particularly in the twilight zone ! fade to black .
7|Twilight Zone|The Eye of the Beholder|November 11, 1960|the twilight zone season two `` the eye of the beholder '' teleplay by rod serling air date : november 11 , 1960 1. standard opening with human eye changing into setting sun . pan down to opening scene of play . 2. int . hospital room night ( production note : throughout the play until otherwise indicated , all characters with the exception of janet are played either in the shadows or the camera is on their back , but never are actually seen face first . ) the camera starts a slow dolly in over toward a bed which , besides a bedstand , is the only furniture in an otherwise bare and antiseptic- looking room . camera stops on an angle shot looking down at janet tyler , whose face is entirely swathed in a bandaged mask , with only a little slit left open for the mouth . she remains motionless . even her hands are limp , unprotesting extensions of herself , as if they too we are resigned to a life of silent darkness . there is the noise of a door swinging open and then the very slight sound of glass medicine bottles rattling on a tray . the bandaged face turns toward the sound : cut to : 3. mad . long shot across the room a nurse has just entered and is placing the tray down near the door . the position of the bedlight throws the far end of the room in shadows , so that all we can see of the nurse is that of angular , tall silhouette , her face invisible . her voice , when she speaks , has a brittle and professional quality , unemotional and with a suggestion of boredom . jbnet nurse ? nurse brought you your sleeping medicine , honey . janet is it night already ? nurse it is nine-thirty . 4. different angle janet as her head turns to look up toward the ceiling . janet what about the day ? nurse what about it ? janet was it a beautiful day ? was the sun out ? was it warm ? 4.- 5. moving shot the nurse as seen from behind her as she walks over to the bed , administers to the bandaged woman . the camera remains on her back . nurse kinda warm . janet clouds ? we are there clouds in the sky ? we can see the nurse shrug . her voice becomes even duller . nurse i suppose there we are . i never was much for staring up at the sky all the time . now the nurse screws back the top on a medicine bottle , puts it in her pocket , shakes down a thermometer . janet i used to look up at clouds a lot . if you stare at them long enough they become `` things . '' do you know what i mean ? ships , people , pastoral scenes ... anything you want , really , if you stare at them long enough . nurse time to take your temperature now . she moves the thermometer toward janet 's mouth . jenet just one other thing ... ? nurse well ? janet when ... when will they take the bandages off ? 6. close shot thermometer it stops , poised in mid-air , then travels in an are back toward the nurse 's side . 7. different long angle as seen from above . the nurse has turned away , obviously reacting to the question . janet 's head follows her . janet ( cont 'd ) how long ? nurse until ... until they decide whether they can fix up your face or not . janet < very softly ) oh . i guess it is ... i guess it is pretty bad , is not it ? 8. different angle shooting over the nurse ‘ s shoulder toward janet nurse I have seen worse . janet but it is pretty bad , is not it ? i know it is pretty bad . ever since i can remember ... ever since i was a little girl ... people have turned away from me . the very first thing i can remember is a little child screaming when she looked at me . 9. extremely tight profile shot of her bandaged face as she once again turns away . her voice is soft , but there is a sense of desperation , of misery , of anguish that creeps in . janet ( cont 'd ) i never wanted to be beautiful . i never wanted to look like a painting . i never even wanted to be loved . ( a pause ) i just wanted ... i just wanted people not to scream when they looked at me . ( now the bandaged face turns once again toward the nurse ) when , nurse ? when will they take the bandages off this time ? 10. different angle the back of the nurse as she once again leans over , puts the thermometer in janet 's mouth , then turns , but so close to the camera that we are shooting her body below the face . she passes the camera and moves again to the opposite side of the room and into the shadows . the camera remains on this shot . nurse maybe tomorrow . maybe the next day . you have been waiting so long now ... it really does not make too much difference whether it is two days or weeks now , does it ? 11. reverse angle looking back over to the bed janet 's head moves from side to side , shaking her head `` no . '' the nurse looks down at her watch then once again moves away from the camera over to the bed , takes the thermometer out , ‘ 1- shakes it , then in identical fashion to before , passes the camera and goes out of the room . cut to : 12. int . hospital corridor night this is a long , bare , almost cavernous , tunnel—like hallway . the lights are dim and , once again , the people who pass under them — a doctor , another nurse , a patient - are in shadows and we can not see their faces . a few doors down from janet 's room is a kind of reception desk . a nurse sits there , her back to camera . 13. long shot down the corridor looking toward reception desk as janet 's nurse comes from behind the camera and starts walking toward the desk . 14. med . long shot intercom on the reception desk as the camera moves toward it , staying on the back of janet 's nurse . 15. close shot nurse 's hand as she flicks a button on the intercom . nurse dr. bernardi . evening report on patient 307. resting comfortably . no temperature change . doctor 's voice ( over intercom ) thank you , nurse . I will be down later . the nurse flicks off the button . nurse two ever see her face ? 307 ? nurse indeed i have . if it we are mine , I would bury myself in a grave someplace . poor thing . some people want to live no matter what ! ( a pause ) got a cigarette ? a pack of cigarettes passes in front of the camera . janet ‘ s nurse ‘ s hand moves toward the pack and takes out a cigarette , then moves out of the frame . there ‘ s the sound of a match being struck o.c. , then a cloud of smoke exhaled into the air . the camera moves around so that it is shooting through the smoke across the desk , down toward the corridor and janet 's room . at this moment we freeze frame . two nurses walking down the corridor away from the camera stop and become immobile , and over this tableau we hear serling 's voice . serling 's voice suspended in time and space for a moment . out of janet tyler 's room now walks serling . behind him we still see the stationary figures of the nurses . serling you have been introduced to miss janet tyler , who lives in a very private world of darkness ; a universe whose dimensions are the size , thickness , length of a swathe of bandages that cover her face . in a moment we will go back into this room , and also in a moment we will look under the bandages . ( a pause ) keeping in mind , of course , that we are not to be surprised by what we see , because this is not just a hospital . and this patient 307 is not just a woman . this happens to be the twilight zone ... and miss janet tyler , patient number 307 ... with you , is about to enter it ! fade to black -- opening billboard-—first commercial -- fade on : 16. int . hospital room [ night ] extremely tight profile shot bandaged face of janet tyler beyond , at the far end of the room , are the shadowy figures of the doctor and the nurse . we hear them indistinctly and muffled . occasionally words like `` temperature , '' `` pressure , '' `` thyroid , '' `` injection '' can be heard above the general indistinct rumble of their voices . finally the doctor takes a step toward the camera and the bed , his face still in the shadows . doctor ( over his shoulder ) come back about eleven , nurse . give her the usual sedative then . nurse all right , doctor . the camera arcs around so that it is shooting behind the doctor as he approaches the bed . he reaches it , picks up janet 's arm , briefly checks her pulse while he looks down at her . doctor warm this evening , miss tyler . janet i thought it was . i could not be sure , though . doctor ( running a hand through his collar ) very warm . you can take my word for it . we will have those bandages off you very shortly . i expect you are uncomfortable . janet I am used to bandages on my face . doctor I have no doubt . this is your ... ninth visit here ? is it the ninth ? janet the eleventh . ( a pause as she turns her bandaged face toward him ) sometimes i think I have lived my whole life inside a dark cave . the walls are gauze . and the wind that blows in from the mouth of the cave always smells of ether and disinfectant . ( a pause ) there ‘ s a kind of a comfort though , doctor , to living in this cave . it is so wonderfully private . ( she turns her head away ) no one can ever see me . ( another pause ) it is hopeless , is not it , doctor ? i ‘ ll never look any different . doctor ( putting her wrist down ) that is hard to say . up to now you have not responded to the medication or to the shots or any of the proven techniques . frankly , you have stumped us , miss tyler . nothing we have done so far has made any difference at all . but we are hopeful of what this last treatment may have accomplished . there is no telling , of course - not till we get the bandages off . unfortunately your case is one that can not be handled with plastic surgery . bone structure , flesh type ... many factors prohibit this kind of approach . i . he turns away . the camera arcs around with him so that he is never full on camera . doctor ( cont 'd ) your eleventh visit . a pause . he moves over to the table , taps on it tentatively . 17. close shot his fingers as they tap . 18. angle shot looking across janet toward the slouched figure of the doctor there ‘ s a silence and finally janet breaks it . janet no more after this , are there ? no more tries . doctor eleven is the mandatory number of experiments . ( he shrugs ) no more are permitted after eleven . janet now what ? doctor well you are kind of jumping the gun , miss tyler . you may very well have responded to these last injections . there is no way of telling till we get those bandages off . janet but if i have not responded — then what ? doctor there are alternatives . janet like ? the doctor starts to turn . we cut abruptly before he gets to face the camera to : doctor do not you know ? janet ( very softly ) i know . doctor ( approaching the bed ) you realize , of course , miss tyler , why these rules are in effect ? ( more ) doctor ( cont 'd ) each of us is afforded as much opportunity as possible to fit in with society . in your case , think of the time and money and effort expended to make you look— he stops abruptly . his head goes down as if searching for a word . janet to make me look like what ? doctor normal . the way you would like to look . 20. different angle janet as she rises in bed , supporting herself on her elbows . janet doctor ? may i walk outdoors ? may i sit out on the lawn ? just for a little while . just to smell the flowers . just to ... just to feel the air . just for ... just for ... ( she bolts upright in bed now . her voice takes on a different tone , a strained , tight , close—to- breaking harshness ) to make believe , doctor ! to make believe that i ag normal . if i sit outside in the darkness , then i kn0w the whole world is dark . I am more a part of it that way . not just one grotesque , ugly , deformed woman with a bandage around her face ... with a special darkness that belongs to her . the camera moves in for a very close shot of her bandaged face and now her voice is high , shrill , and unsteady . janet ( cont 'd ) i want 39 belon ! i want to be like other people . please help me , doctor . ( now her voice catches in a sob ) please help me . the camera moves around so that it is shooting toward the doctor who stands in the shadows . he is silent for a moment and then his voice is soft . doctor you ‘ re not alone , miss tyler . you realize that , don ‘ t you ? you are hardly alone . there are many others who share your misfortune . people who look much as you do . one of the alternatives ... should this last treatment prove unsuccessful ... well , this is simply to allow you to move into a special area in which people of your own kind have been congregated . janet people of my own kind ! ( a pause ) congregated , doctor ? you do not mean congregated , you mean segregated . you mean imprisoned . you are talking about a ghetto now . ( and then plaintive , anguished , and more as a cry , she shrieks this out ) a ghetto designed for freaks ! doctor ( shouting ) miss tyler ! the state is not unsympathetic . your presence here in this hospital attests to this . it ‘ s doing all it can for you . but you are not being rational , miss tyler . you can not expect to live any kind of life amongst ... ( again he gropes , but picks it up quickly ) amongst normal people . cut to : 21. close shot janet the bandages twitch as if , underneath , her face we are contorting . janet i could try . i could wear a mask or this bandage . i would not bother anyone . I would just go my own way . I would take a job . gny job . ( her voice breaks again ) who are you people anyway ? what is this state ? who makes up all the rules and the statutes and the traditions ? the people who are different have to stay away from other people who are normal . the state is not god , doctor . .lu . doctor ( firmly and obviously concerned ) miss tyler , please ! janet the state is not god . it has not the right to penalize people for an accident of birth . it has not the right to make ugliness a crime— doctor ( shouting ) miss tyler , i must ask you to stop this kind of talk immediately ! 59w , miss tyler , now ! the camera moves back over to a shot of janet , who gets out of bed and stands there for a moment motionless with her head down , then very slowly , a hand out in front of her , she moves across the room over to a window . she touches it , then puts her bandaged cheek against it . cut to : 22. reverse angle looking at her through the glass one hand moves down the pane until it reaches the open section at the bottom . she moves her hand back and forth . jznet ( softly ) i feel the night out there . i feel the air . i can smell the flowers . ( she turns slowly to face the doctor . both hands go up to touch the bandage , in a very small , still voice ) please take this off me . please take this off me . ( then screaming ) take this 9 : : me ! she starts to clutch and scrabble at the bandage , screaming as she does so . abrupt cut to : 23. int . corridor room indicator on wall over reception desk a light `` 307 '' flashes over and over again . in the b.g . we hear janet 's screaming voice pleading for the removal of the bandage . the nurse passes the camera hurriedly . camera pans around so that it is looking at her as she races down the corridor toward janet 's room . abrupt cut to : 1.1.. 24. int . hospital room as seen through the window from outside the doctor is holding a fighting , squirming janet as the nurse barges in , takes her other arm and the two of them move her back over to the bed . the scene is played in pantomime and finally janet quiets down . we then see the nurse walk back over to the door and exit . cut to : 25. int . corridor med . shot reception nurse reading a magazine that covers up her face . janet ‘ s nurse walks in front of camera so that we see most of her back and part of the nurse sitting behind the magazine . janet 's nurse the doctor 's decided to remove the bandages in 307. he wants to have the anesthetist stand by . 26. different angle the reception nurse she turns just at the moment of the camera cut so that we actually do not see her face . nurse two of course , it is not for me to say , but i think they spend an awful lot of time and trouble on some of these face oases — these throwbacks : why not ship them out in the beginning ? she reaches for her magazine again and starts to turn in her chair , at which point the camera again cuts to : 27. shot of her back looking over her shoulder . jhnet 's nurse is that what you would want ? if it we are you ? the second nurse flicks the intercom impatiently . nurse two anesthesia , please . wanted for 307. yes . she may get violent . fade to black-—end act one—-act two*—fade on : 28. int . corridor reception desk [ night ] a nurse and an orderly lounge around , backs to camera . the orderly looks at his watch , then across at a large television .ll- set perched on the far end of the counter which fronts the reception desk . orderly leader ‘ s speaking tonight . goes on in just a few minutes . he rises , flicks on the set , then lights a cigarette . 29. top hat shot the match as it goes into the ashtray . directly across on a direct line is the front of the television set which shows an extremely long shot of a desk with an official seal behind it . a man sits behind it , too far off to distinguish clearly beyond a general outline . an off—camera voice announces portentously . announcer and now , ladies and gentlemen , our leader . there is cheering and offstage applause , and we now hear the stentorian tones of the gentleman just announced . leader 's voice good evening , ladies and gentlemen . tonight i shall talk to you about glorious conformity ... about the delight and the ultimate pleasure of our unified society . you recall , of course , that directionless , unproductive , over-sentimentalized era of man 's history when it was assumed that dissent was some kind of natural and healthy adjunct to society . we also recall that during this period of time there was a strange over—sentimentalized concept that it mattered not that people we are different , that ideas we are at variance with one another , that a world could exist in some kind of crazy , patchwork kind of makeup , with foreign elements glued together in a crazy quilt . we realize , of course , now , that ... his voice continues underneath as the camera moves away from him and shoots down the hall . the leader 's voice continues through the bandage—removal scene . 30. different angle the door of janet 's room dissolve to : 31. int . hospital room night janet now sits in a chair in the center of the room . a single overhead light has been turned on so that she alone is j.j- illuminated almost as if by a spotlight . there is a low murmur of voices underneath as other shadowy figures in the room walk back and forth in front of her , their shadows playing briefly on her bandaged face as they move . behind this scene , intermittently , we can hear the voice of the leader on the television set outside . then the voices of the doctor and the people in the room die off . the doctor 's body steps in front of the camera . camera pans down to a shot of his right hand . it holds a scissors . doctor now i have to ask you once again , miss tyler . i must insist that you promise to remain rational . no tantrums . no temperament . and no violence . you understand ? janet nods . doctor ( cont 'd ) now I will tell you precisely what I am going to do . I am going to cut the bandage at a point on the left side of your head . I will start to unwind the bandage very gradually . the process has to be slow so that you can become accustomed to the light . as you know , the injections may have had an effect on your vision . now as i unwrap , i want you to keep your eyes open and i want you to describe to me the different shading of light as you perceive it as each layer of bandage comes off . janet ( softly ) all right . 32. different angle profile shot janet we see the doctor 's body from the neck down , the scissors now held in front of him . doctor now if you make any movement or if you start getting emotional on us , miss tyler , I am going to have to have the nurses hold you down and have the anesthetist put you under sedation . is that understood ? janet ( falteringly ) i promise ... i will not . doctor all right then . j_ ‘ l- the scissors come out in front of him and move toward the camera . from this angle they are disproportionately large and almost fill the screen . we see them perform some movement and the bandages start to move in sections across the screen as if being unwound from a head . doctor ( cont 'd ) do you see any light new , miss tyler ? janet just a little . it looks ... it looks gray . doctor all right now , just be very quiet . again bandage swirls across the screen and then stops . doctor ( cont 'd ) now , miss tyler ? janet much brighter . very bright . doctor look up toward the light . cut to : 33. angle shot looking up toward light a diffuse sun as seen through layers of bandage . 34. reverse angle over the doctor 's shoulder looking down toward janet 's face as once again he starts to unwrap bandage . doctor ( cont 'd ) how about now , miss tyler ? janet it is bright . it is very bright . doctor good . ( he continues to unwrap then stops ) i ‘ m at the last layer now , miss tyler . janet 's face goes up . janet i can ... i can just distinguish your outline . just vaguely ... but i can see you . doctor now i ‘ m going to remove the last bandage , miss tyler . now do you want a mirror ? .de there is a silence . janet no . no , thank you . no mirror . again she looks up as if trying to scan the faces of the others in the room . 35. pan shot past the faces of the anesthetist , and two nurses in the shadows as they watch motionlessly and tensely . 36. different angle janet as seen from the back of her head . the doctor once again reaches for the last of the bandages . doctor now I am going to remove the last bandage , miss tyler . and i want you to remember this please . miss tyler ? are you listening ? janet yes , I am listening . doctor we have done all we could . if we we are successful - all well and good . there are no problems . if , however , this final treatment has not achieved the desired results , keep in mind that you can still live a long and fruitful life among people of your own kind . as soon as we discover these results , we will either release you ... or ... he pauses for a moment . 37. another pan shot past the shadowy faces of the other people in the room , winding up on a shot of janet 's thinly bandaged face through which we can now see the outline of her features , eyes , nose , mouth , but no definitive portrait of a face . janet doctor ? doctor yes . jinet if I am still ... if I am still terribly ugly , is there any other alternative ? could i ... could i be put away ? doctor under certain circumstances , miss tyler ... the state does provide for ( more ) doctor ( cont 'd ) extermination of undesirables . there are many factors to be considered , though , that bear on the decision . under the circumstances , considering your age ... your general physical condition ... i doubt very much if we could permit anything but your transfer to a communal group of people with your ... your disability . janet you ‘ ll make me go then ? doctor that will probably be the case . all right , miss tyler . remain very quiet please . keep your eyes open . 38. different angle from behind the doctor as he reaches forward and starts to unwind the last bandage . the first strip of bandage comes off the top of her forehead , another layer revealing her forehead , another layer uncovering just the upper part of her eyebrows and eyes . doctor ( cont 'd ) all right , miss tyler . now here comes the last of it . i wish you every good luck ! again he reaches over and starts to unwind as we cut to : 39. shadowy faces of the other people in the room there ‘ s a moment ‘ s absolute silence , then one of the nurses let us out a gasp . another involuntarily throws a hand and arm across her face to blot out what is obviously an incredible spectacle . 40. flash close shot doctor 's hand as he drops the scissors and they land on the floor . he then steps back into the shadows to stand close to the others . doctor ‘ s voice no change ! no change at all ! 41. closeup janet she raises her head . if she is not startlingly beautiful , we have missed our point entirely . 42. different angle from behind janet as she slowly rises . her hands come up from her side to touch her face , then remain there as her head bends over and she buries her face in her hands . in the silence we hear one rasping sob that is finally and painfully controlled . then she looks up , scanning the faces that confront her , then .llo suddenly she breaks away and races toward the door . the doctor hurriedly and expertly steps in front of her way and grabs her . doctor ( curtly to the other man in the room ) needle , please . i was afraid of this . ( then to the nurse ) turn on the lights ! the shadowy form of the nurse moves over to the light switch . 43. close shot her hand as she turns on the switch . 44.—47 . abrupt flash closeups of the two nurses , the anesthetist , and then the doctor each face is more grotesque than the other . noses , eyes , mouths , ears , everything , almost as if they we are cartoons ; almost as if they we are caricature drawings come to life . 48. med . close shot the anesthetist a syringe in his hand , as he walks slowly toward the struggling girl whose face is buried against the doctor . he holds up the needle and at this moment janet breaks free , opens the door wildly and races out into the corridor . 49. long shot as she races down the corridor past amazed nurses and doctors , each of whom has the same odd ugliness of those we have already seen . 50. close shot door of janet 's room as the doctor barges out . doctor ( cont 'd ) ( shouts ) stop that patient ! stop her ! 51.-53. series of shots of janet as she races down empty corridors . 54. close shot elevator operator he opens the doors to the elevator just as janet passes . he , like all the others , is a cartoon—looking character . 55. close shot doctor coming out of operating room , removing his mask just as janet runs by him . his face is like that of the elevator operator . ( the following covers janet 's running through the corridor . ) leader 's voice i say to you now ... i say to you now that there is no such thing as a permissive society , because such a society can not exist ! ( more ) leader 's voice ( cont 'd ) they will scream at you and rant and rave and conjure up some dead and decadent picture of an ancient time when they said that all men are created equal ! but to them equality was an equality of opportunity , an equality of status , an equality of aspiration ! and then , in what must surely be the pinnacle of insanity , the absolute in inconsistency , they would have had us believe that this equality did not apply to form , to creed . they permitted a polyglot , accident-bred , mongrel—like mass of diversification to blanket the earth , to infiltrate and weaken ! ( now he shrieks ) well , we know now that there must be a single purpose ! a single norm ! a single approach ! a single entity of peoples ! a single virtue ! a single morality ! a_single frame of reference ! a single philosophy of government ! ( shrieking again ) we can not permit ... we must not permit the encroaching sentimentality of a past age to weaken our resolve . we must cut out all that is different like a cancerous growth : 56. running shot janet as she races down the corridor . 57.-59. different angles television screens as she runs by them . each with a different angle of the face of the leader as he continues to speak , his voice droning , unintelligible , but persistent and gradually taking on a build of excitement . 60. different angle janet as she stops in the middle of an empty hall and looks left , right , in front and then back . cut to : 61.—63 . interspersed shots of the television screen as each shot shows it in larger and larger perspective . the face of the leader is incredibly ugly as it shouts down at her . 64. zoom in to close shot janet ‘ s back as her hands go to the sides of her head , as if trying to shut out the noises . 65. long angle shot looking down as she races down the last corridor and turns a corner then stops dead . whip pan up to giant television screen . the leader 's face fills it up entirely , screaming , ranting , contorting . j.j- 66. close shot janet 's hand as she instinctively reaches for an ashtray near a bench which is against one wall . 67. different angle as she picks it up and flings it across the corridor . 68. extremely tight close shot television screen the ashtray hits the face of the leader head on and splinters the set , and from the broken , smoking remnant of the machine , we hear the voice of the leader . leader 's voice ( cont 'd ) it is essential in this society that we not only have a norm , but that we conform to that norm . differences weaken us . variations destroy us . an incredible permissiveness to deviation from this norm is what has ended nations and brought them to their knees . conformity we must worship and hold sacred . conformity is the key to survival . the voice persists as we cut to : 69. different angle janet as she races down the corridor past the screen . 70. close shot double doors unlabled , as janet runs in and smashes through them . 71. int . room med . shot janet bursts in and recoils in shock and horror at something she sees o.s . she shrieks and slides slowly down to the ground in a huddled heap and begins to cry . the camera moves down . the legs and feet of whatever monstrosity she has seen move into f.g. janet is terrified . then the doctor enters from another direction and bends down to her soothingly . doctor do not be afraid , miss tyler . this is a representative of the group you are to live with . oddly enough , you have come right to him . come on now — he will not hurt you . he lifts the terrified girl to her feet . 72. closeup janet forces herself to look at the newcomer , her face full of revulsion . lu . 73. full shot walter smith steps into the light . we see a youthful , tremendously attractive young man , dressed plainly in simple trousers and shirt . doctor ( cont 'd ) this is mr. smith , janet . walter smith . he is in charge of the village group in the north . he will take you there tonight . you can live among your own kind now . 74. different angle smith as he walks over to janet . we are looking across her back and up into smith 's face . in addition to being attractive , it is a gentle face , a compassionate face , an infinitely kind face . he smiles , his voice is gentle and soft . smith miss tyler ? the girl 's head is raised . smith ( cont 'd ) we have a lovely village and wonderful people . i think you will like it where I am going to take you . you will be with your own kind , and after a little while — you ‘ d be amazed how little a while — you will feel a sense of great belonging . you will feel a sense of being loved . and you will be loved , miss tyler . the girl remains motionless now . smith looks up and gestures with his head . 75. different angle the room as the doctor leaves and shuts the door behind him . 76. close shot smith smith ( cont 'd ) miss tyler ? would you get your things now ? we can leave any time . the camera starts a very , very slow arc until finally it is shooting directly into the face of janet tyler . she is like a beautiful living portrait . a face carved into the mold of all things woman . gentle , beautiful , feminine , and young . janet mr. smith ? smith yes ? l ; - janet why ... why are some of us born so ugly ? smith ( smiles sadly ) i do not know , miss tyler . i really do not know . ( a pause ) but do you know something ? it does not really matter . there is an old saying ... a very , very old saying . beauty is in the eye of the beholder . when we leave here ... when we go to the village ... keep that in mind . try , miss tyler . say it over and over in your mind . beauty is in the eye of the beholder . ( a pause as he takes her hand ) come on , now . we ‘ ll get your things and we will leave . the two of them walk to the double doors . he opens them for her and they walk out into the corridor , a vast empty passageway that stretches out almost to infinity . the camera remains stationary as they walk away from it down the corridor . serling 's voice now the questions that come to mind : where is this place and when is it ? what kind of world , where ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation from that norm ? you want an answer ? the answer is ... it does not make any difference . because the old saying happens to be true . beauty is in the eye of the beholder . in this year or a hundred years hence . ( a pause ) on this planet ... or wherever there is human life , perhaps out amongst the stars . ( a pause ) beauty is in the eye of the beholder . lesson to be learned ... in the twilight zone . fade to black .
8|Twilight Zone|The Howling Man|November 4, 1960|the twilight zone `` the howling man '' written by charles beaumont act one int . ellington 's room - night fade in and pan down to a dark and stormy night . a man looks out of an open window at the storm and then turns to reveal his anguished face . this is david ellington -- grim , wild-eyed , graying around the temples -- as he addresses some unseen person urgently , amid the roar of thunder , the howl of the wind , and the patter of rain . ellington i know . it is -- it is an incredible story . i , of all people , know this . and you will not believe me . no , not at first . but I am going to tell you the whole thing . then , you will believe , because you must . you must believe . it happened many years ago , after the first world war . i was on a walking trip through central europe . but one night , i ... one night , i got lost in a storm . ellington turns back to the open window just over his shoulder where the storm rages . dissolve to : ext . the castle a similar stormy night , decades earlier . a flashback to central europe , where an imposing , ornate , medieval castle looms out of the darkness . a younger david ellington staggers through the blinding rain to the huge wooden door of the castle and knocks . a heavily-accented voice from behind the door answers . christophorus yes ? who is it ? the door swings open to reveal brother christophorus , a bearded giant in robes , carrying a long wooden staff and an ancient lantern . ellington please , please let me in . I am lost . christophorus I am sorry . we do not allow visitors in the hermitage . ellington oh , i-i-i-I am not a visitor . i-I am a stranger here . i-i got lost . ellington tries to enter but christophorus blocks the way with his staff . ellington oh , you do not understand . I am lost . christophorus looks ellington over warily and with a barely perceptible nod , clears the way for him to unsteadily enter , and closes the door behind him . cut to : int . entry hall the castle 's torch-lit entry hall , primitive , like something out of the middle ages . a soaked , shivering ellington , clutching a traveling bag , looks the entry hall over as christophorus leads him through it . other men , dressed like christophorus and carrying staffs , appear in adjacent doorways , staring at ellington . ellington , already weak , suddenly grows dizzy , staggers against a stone doorway , and has a coughing fit . christophorus turns to look at him . ellington i-I will be all right once i dry out . christophorus wait here . i have to speak to brother jerome . christophorus disappears through a doorway as ellington drops his traveling bag and puts his back to the doorway , trying to regain his composure . his eyes widen at the sound of a wicked howl . is it a wolf ? is he dreaming ? the storm continues to rage . ellington looks around for the source of the howling as christophorus returns . christophorus brother jerome will see you now . a puzzled ellington reacts to another evil-sounding howl . ellington what was that ? christophorus the wind . come . unconvinced , ellington gives christophorus a long look before they proceed . int . office christophorus leads ellington into what passes for an office . seated at an ancient wooden desk before huge windows that reveal the ongoing storm is brother jerome -- flowing white hair and beard and robes , very much like moses -- a commanding presence even while sitting . jerome glances at christophorus and then at ellington . jerome why have you come here ? ellington my-my name is ellington . i-I am on a walking trip . i got lost in the storm . ellington has another coughing fit . he is clearly in bad shape , and getting worse . ellington excuse me . i saw light here . jerome what do you want from us ? ellington shelter . maybe some food . jerome shakes his head sorrowfully . jerome we can not help you . you will have to leave . ( rises majestically ) now , mr. ellington . now . in disbelief , a silent ellington slowly turns and staggers out of the office . int . entry hall but the effort becomes too much for him . ellington collapses and passes out . jerome , christophorus and the other men gather around him , making no move to help . an omniscient narrator has a few things to say about this . narrator ( voice over ) the prostrate form of mr. david ellington , scholar , seeker of truth and , regrettably , finder of truth . a man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time ... . an image of the narrator , in suit and tie , hands folded before him , magically appears over the scene , as he finishes his comments . narrator ... a man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary and found instead the outer edges of the twilight zone . fade out int . entry hall fade in on a now-conscious ellington in the empty entry hall , later that night . he touches his brow and unsteadily crosses to an ornate window to look out at the still raging storm . no one else is present . at the sound of more howling , ellington turns and follows the noise . he staggers along , occasionally leaning against a wooden beam or doorway for support until he comes to a wooden door , held shut by a staff similar to the ones carried by jerome , christophorus , and the other men . he approaches it cautiously and peers through the barred window in the door . it is a prison cell . ellington sees a man whose back is turned towards him -- it is the howling man , gaunt , dirty and dressed in rags . but as the howling man turns , sees ellington , and rushes to him , he reveals a gentle , bearded face and a gentle voice . the howling man reaches through the barred window and clutches ellington 's shoulder . ellington tries to pull away . the howling man help me . no , please . in the name of mercy , help me . you are not one of them . ellington no . my name 's ellington . I am an american . the howling man ( releases his grip ) sshh ! we have only moments . come closer . come . ellington does so . the howling man they are mad , mister ellington . all of them . raving mad . listen . i was in the village in schwartzof . i was walking in the street with my woman . we paused to rest by a tree . and we kissed . is it wrong to kiss ? tell me . ellington i-i do not think so . the howling man of course , you do not . you do not think so , i do not think so . but jerome -- the lecherous old fool -- we looked up and i saw him standing close by . i tried to open my mouth to speak but before i could utter a sound , he raised that heavy staff he carries -you have seen it ? -- and he hit me , again and again . ellington why ? the howling man for revenge . because she refused his advances . he took his fury out on me . ellington i-I am sorry . i find this difficult to believe . the howling man of course , you do , mister ellington . that is the strength of the man . he makes his madness seem a harmless thing . the-the-the madness of a religious zealot . this is not a religious order , mister ellington . these so-called brothers of truth -- they are outcasts , misfits , cut off from the world because the world will not have them . mister ellington , please , you must believe me . i do not say they are evil . i say they are mad . ellington starts to walk away . the howling man grabs him by the shoulder . the howling man where 're you going ? ellington I will speak to jerome . the howling man noooo . he is the greatest maniac of them all . ellington then , how can i help you ? a deep voice rings out . jerome mister ellington ! jerome , christophorus , and a few others stand a few feet away . ellington approaches them . jerome i did not know that you we are well enough to walk . come with me , please . ellington i-i must talk with you . jerome ( pointing ) this way . the other men watch as jerome and ellington silently head back to jerome 's office . the storm grows worse . christophorus gives the howling man 's cell a long look . cut to : int . office jerome and ellington enter . jerome i must ask you to leave the hermitage , mister ellington . we have no facilities for the care of the ill. arrangements can be made at schwartzof -ellington now , just a minute ... jerome no , not a minute , not another second , mister ellington . now ! ellington why ? jerome I have already explained that . ellington no , you have explained nothing . jerome shuts the door . ellington no one asked me to come here . i realize that . but that is no excuse for your behavior . jerome my son ... ellington I am not your son . jerome you do not understand . ellington that is right . i-i do not . so why do not you tell me ? why are you in such a hurry to have me leave ? what are you afraid I will find out ? it is the man you have locked up in the cell , is not it , brother ? well , that is not a secret anymore . i know about him . jerome what man is this , mister ellington ? ellington the one we just left . the one who is been screaming his head off . jerome I am not sure you know what you are saying . ellington , growing dizzy , takes a seat . ellington look , brother , i -- i do not know much about this cult of yours , what is permitted , what is not permitted . i seriously doubt if you have the authority to imprison a man against his will . jerome that is quite true . we have no such authority . ellington then why have you done it ? jerome no man has ever been imprisoned in the hermitage , mister ellington . ellington i was just talking with him . jerome you talked to no man . you have been very ill , mister ellington . you have suffered delirium . jerome puts a sympathetic hand on ellington 's shoulder just as a piercing howl causes ellington to bolt out of his chair . he backs away from jerome . ellington oh , no . do not tell me you did not hear that . honest men make unconvincing liars . a wicked clap of thunder punctuates the comment . ellington I will find out eventually , you know . jerome what do you mean ? ellington just what i said . the police will be very interested to learn that you are keeping a man imprisoned here -jerome i tell you , there is no man . ellington all right , all right . just ... forget it . jerome watches with concern as ellington crosses to the door , opens it , and starts to leave . jerome mister ellington . ellington stops and turns . ellington yes ? jerome would you really go to the police ? ellington would you ? another clap of thunder . jerome very well . i told you the truth but only part of it . now , i see i shall have to tell you the whole truth . shut the door , mister ellington . ellington shuts the door just as a particularly long , sad howl causes jerome to wince and put his hand to his ears . ellington looks relieved . ellington then you do hear it . jerome as i have heard it every hour of every day for five long years . jerome crosses to the window . ellington why did you lie ? jerome i did not . when i told you that no man howled at the hermitage , i was being perfectly honest . what you saw is not a man . it is the devil himself ! this rates two claps of thunder and a fade out on jerome 's ominous , lightning-lit face . end of act one act two int . office fade in on jerome , still at the window , moments later . jerome yes , the devil himself . what you saw in the cell is satan , otherwise known as the dark angel , ahriman , asmodeus , belial , diabolus , the devil . you asked for the truth . now you have it . you do believe me , do not you ? ellington ah , sure . of course . ellington starts backing away from a wild-eyed jerome who rants on . jerome no . now , it is you who are lying , mister ellington . you do not believe me at all . quite to the contrary . you are now quite certain of what you suspected , that i am mad . sit down , mister ellington . and we will see . ellington sits . jerome let me tell you a story and we will see how certain you are that i am mad . how certain you are of anything . jerome walks away from ellington and begins pacing around the room through the following : jerome i suppose you fancy yourself a sophisticated man . you consider us to be primitive because we live here in solitude , away from the so-called real world . we are misfits . ellington oh , no , no . jerome oh , please . i know all the theories . ellington i assure you , brother , that-jerome no , mister ellington , it is i who am assuring you that i am not the ignorant fanatic i would appear . oh , i coped with your world for forty years , and rather successfully , at that . the best schools , a degree in philosophy , a job that took me to the ends of the earth . this beard , this staff , and this faith are merely the results of a different point of view . if you can understand that , you can listen to what i have to say with an open mind . another wicked howl unnerves ellington , but jerome takes it in stride . jerome five years ago , there we are no howls in the hermitage . it was simply the bombed-out ruin of an old castle belonging to the family wulfran . baron wulfran gave it to the brotherhood of truth as a gesture of charity . our job was to tend the vineyards and save what souls we could by constant prayer . ellington but this is not a religious order , is it , brother ? jerome we feel that we are recognized by god . truth is our dogma . we believe it to be man 's greatest weapon against the devil , who is the father of all lies . ellington rises . ellington all right , go on with your story . you we are tending the vineyards . jerome at that time , shortly after the great war , the world was in chaos . everywhere was unhappiness . except in this little village below . jerome points a finger toward a rain-streaked window . jerome for some reason the people of schwartzof refused to yield to despair . they lost none of their faith . they continued as they had been for centuries . honest , god-fearing , and happy . this village was a plum to satan , one he could not resist . so , he came here and embarked upon a program of corruption . ellington but you stopped him . jerome yes ! you see , mister ellington ... a quick clap of thunder for punctuation . as jerome approaches ellington ominously . jerome ... he made the same mistake that you have made . he underestimated me . he thought he would have no difficulty in tempting the old fool . ellington backs away and sits again . jerome but i had him in a cell before he knew what happened . ellington but , if he is the devil , how do you keep him locked up ? jerome with the staff of truth ! a wild-eyed jerome flourishes his staff above his head dramatically and then lowers it . jerome the one barrier he can not pass . ellington tell me , how did you recognize him ? he does not look evil . jerome the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape . i had seen him before , in all parts of the world . in all forms and guises . wherever there was sin . wherever there was strife . wherever there was corruption . and persecution . there he was also . sometimes he was only a spectator , a face in the crowd . but , always , he was there . jerome pounds his staff on the floor insistently . all this is too much for ellington who again grows dizzy , swaying in his chair . jerome now ... you see , i hope , why you must say nothing of what you have seen and heard here . ellington rises again . ellington brother ... not that i doubt you , you understand , only ... well , is not it possible you might have made a mistake ? jerome no ! think , mister ellington . think of the peace of the world these last five years . think of this country now . ( more ) jerome ( cont 'd ) is there another like it ? ellington you have not put an end to-to suffering . there has still murders , robberies . even now while we are talking , people are starving . jerome the suffering man was meant to endure . we because most of our own grief . we need no help from him . it is the unnatural catastrophe , the great wars , the overwhelming pestilences , the wholesale sinning that we have stopped . ellington i believe you , brother . jerome do you truly ? ellington yes . i-i admit i was doubtful at first but you have convinced me . absolutely . i-i promise to keep your secret . jerome good , my son . tomorrow , if you feel well enough , you may leave . jerome crosses to the door and opens it for ellington . jerome in the meantime , brother christophorus will look after you . ellington starts out the door . jerome please . go directly to his room . ellington good night , brother . int . outside the howling man 's cell ellington , sick and dizzy , rubs his stiff neck as he makes his way to the howling man 's cell . ellington grins when he sees the man 's scared , hopeful face in the barred window . the howling man he lied to you , did not he ? i can see that . what 'd he say ? ellington he said that you we are the devil . the howling man ( nearly laughs ) the devil ! that is good . that is wonderful . what a dream for an old devil , to catch the devil and lock him up . ( suddenly concerned ) you do not believe him , do you ? ellington no , of course not . the howling man then help me . ellington look , why do not i just go get the authorities ? the howling man it would be my death warrant . the authorities would return and find nothing . jerome is mad , but he is shrewd , too . a hand appears on ellington 's shoulder . he turns to see it belongs to brother christophorus . christophorus ( politely ) brother jerome was fearful you might lose your way . come . christophorus leads ellington away . the howling man watches them go , a mixture of hope and fear in his face . cut to : int . christophorus ' room moments later , christophorus enters with ellington and shuts the door behind them . christophorus starts to put a key in the lock but ellington grabs his arm . ellington why are you locking the door ? christophorus ( as if it we are obvious ) to protect you . rest now , mister ellington . ( locks the door ) remember , you are still a very sick man . dissolve to : int . christophorus ' room later that night . as christophorus sleeps , ellington carefully steals the key chain from around his neck . collecting his coat , ellington stealthily unlocks the door , opens it , exits , closes it , and then takes one last look at the sleeping christophorus through the door 's window before hurrying away . cut to : int . outside the howling man 's cell a weakened , dizzy ellington approaches . the howling man you have come . good . ellington what do you want me to do ? the howling man lift off the wooden bolt . ellington looks at the wooden staff that bolts the door shut . it appears easily removable and well within the howling man 's reach . ellington ( astonished ) is this all that holds you in ? the howling man yes . lift it off . ellington ( confused ) why have not you done it yourself ? the howling man please . there has no time for talk . mister ellington , in the name of mercy -- if you fail now , they will kill both of us . do not you understand that ? cut to : int . christophorus ' room christophorus awakes with a start , sees that the keys and ellington have vanished , rises and crosses to the door . it is locked . cut to : int . outside the howling man 's cell ellington starts to remove the staff . he is suddenly having serious doubts . he let us go of the staff . the howling man hurry . hurry . cut to : int . christophorus ' room christophorus pounds on the door and yells . christophorus stop ! stop ! stop ! stop ! cut to : int . outside the howling man 's cell ellington , hearing the yells , panics and quickly removes the staff . the cell door slowly swings open and there is a horrific moment of uncertainty as the howling man steps out , a wide grin on his face . ellington hands him his coat . ellington put this on , the storm . the howling man drapes the coat over his shoulders as ellington looks around nervously . ellington is about to lead him to safety when , to the accompaniment of a long roll of thunder , the howling man points a bony finger at ellington 's back , whereupon ellington instantly loses control of his body and collapses to the floor . after a sidelong glance to assure himself that his captors are too late , the howling man allows a dark look to cross his face . his features begin to subtly change . he smiles , strokes his beard , and strides off . a prostrate ellington watches in horror as , with every step , the howling man slowly transforms himself into a hideous horned demon . the coat draped over his shoulders transforms into a cloak . when at last the devil reaches the wall opposite his cell , he turns back to ellington , wraps the cloak about himself , smiles grimly , and disappears in a puff of smoke . a stunned ellington passes out . jerome and christophorus arrive . jerome peers into the empty cell while christophorus glances sympathetically at ellington . jerome and christophorus exchange looks . christophorus walks off while jerome crosses to ellington , now regaining consciousness . jerome puts an arm around him . jerome I am sorry for you , my son . all your life , you will remember this night . and you will know , mister ellington , whom you have turned loose upon the world . ellington i-i did not believe you . i saw him and did not recognize him . jerome that is man 's weakness ... and satan 's strength . ellington stares hard in the direction of the devil 's escape . ellington ( voice over ) in that moment , i decided to spend the rest of my life tracking him down . to recapture the evil I would released . dissolve to : ext . the castle a view of the castle in the storm that night . ellington ( voice over ) the evil that soon took the shape of the second world war , the korean war , the hideous new weapons of war . i swore I would find him again , as brother jerome had done . dissolve to : int . ellington 's room a very small version of the wooden staff of truth as it keeps a 1960s-style door shut . ellington ( voice over ) it took many years but i did it . see ? i have him in there now . a hand gestures toward the door . the hand belongs to ellington -- he appears now as he did in the first scene : older and grayer and as wild-eyed as brother jerome . he turns and crosses to his housekeeper . ellington has been telling his story to her , apparently in a room of ellington 's house . ellington you understand now . you understand why you must not under any circumstances go near that door . you see how important it is that he stay locked up ? the housekeeper looks at him as if he is crazy but nods her assent . ellington good . I am sending him back to brother jerome . he will do a bit of howling but , heh , pay no attention to that . it is a trick . i know . yes , i must go now . ellington crosses to his raincoat and puts it on . ellington must go . i-i have preparations to make . ii 'll be back in just a few minutes . ellington grabs his hat and heads for the door . the storm continues . he pauses and turns back to the housekeeper . ellington ( gravely ) remember . remember . keep that door locked . ellington leaves , shutting the door behind him . the housekeeper turns and stares for a long moment at the bolted door in disbelief -- until a wicked , piercing howl emerges from the other side . startled , she crosses to the door and hesitantly removes the wooden staff . narrator ( voice over ) ancient folk saying : `` you can catch the devil , but you can not hold him long . '' ... the housekeeper turns the knob and opens the door . narrator ( voice over ) ... ask brother jerome . ask david ellington . ... the door swings open to reveal part of the darkened , shadowy room on the other side . narrator ( voice over ) ... they know , and they will go on knowing to the end of their days ... and beyond ... in the twilight zone . pan up , dissolve to and fade out on a starry night sky . the end
9|Twilight Zone|The Lonely|November 13, 1959|107 : `` the lonely '' written by rod serling act one ext . sky [ night ] shot of the sky ... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp , sparkling relief . as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens -narrator 's voice ( o.s . ) there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man . it is a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity . it is the middle ground between light and shadow -- between science and superstition , and it lies between the pit of man 's fears and the summit of his knowledge . this is the dimension of imagination . it is an area which we call the twilight zone . the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot . we are now looking at an empty patch of desert , an arid , dull nondescript piece of land , its monotony broken only by an occasional scrubby , dying cactus , and a few sand dunes that shift nervously and sporadically in a wind that provides the only motion and the only sound to an otherwise stagnant scene . the camera pans left very slowly until it is on a -long shot a cottage that sits alone in the desert . this is a ramshackle , tworoom affair made of corrugated steel , driftwood and other nondescript material . alongside is a beat-up vintage 1930 's sedan . beyond and behind this is a tiny tool she would that houses a small generator . a limp wire extends from the she would to the shack . narrator 's voice ( over the pan ) witness , if you will , a dungeon , made out of mountains , salt flats , and sand that stretch to infinity . the dungeon has an inmate , james a. corry . and this is his residence , a metal shack . ( more ) narrator 's voice ( cont 'd ) an old touring car that squats in the sun and goes nowhere -- for there is nowhere to go . at this point we see corry come out of the house . he is dressed in jeans and a threadbare shirt . he looks up toward the pale sky and the strange , sick , white gleam of the sun , shades his eyes , walks over toward the car and stops , looks at it , touches it with his hand , then leans against it and stares once again toward the horizon . medium close shot across the car looking at corry . he is a man in his early forties of medium height , perhaps a little more muscular than most men . his face was once a strong face ; it is no longer . there is no will left and no resolve . what we see on it now is resignation ; a sense of dull , pervading hopelessness . he rather aimlessly opens the car door and leaving it open , slides in to sit in the driver 's seat and look out the front windshield . the camera moves around so that it is shooting through the front windshield toward him . close shot corry as he gets out of the car and stares across toward the horizon . narrator 's voice for the record let it be known that james a. corry is a convicted criminal placed in solitary confinement . confinement in this case stretches as far as the eye can see , because this particular dungeon is on an asteroid nine million miles from the earth . the camera pans slowly up toward the sky to where we see a shot of the earth . narrator 's voice now witness , if you will , a man 's mind and body shriveling in the sun , a man dying of loneliness . med . shot corry corry , shoulders slumped walking in a kind of draggy , aimless shuffle , goes back toward the shack and walks inside . cut to : int . shack full shot the room the inside , like the exterior , is makeshift and looks temporary . the furniture is made out of packing cases . there is an aged wind-up victrola , an icebox . the bed is disheveled and dirty . he walks over to a small rickety table , takes out a dog-eared ledger , opens it and rifles through the pages slowly and rather aimlessly . then he takes a pencil , sits down , and starts to write . the camera moves in very slowly as he voices aloud that which he is writing . corry 's voice entry , fifteenth day , sixth month ... the year four . and all the days and the months and the years the same . ( a pause . now he sits as he writes ) there 'll be a supply ship coming in soon . i think . they are either due or overdue , and i hope it is allenby 's ship because he is a decent man and he brings things for me . ( he stops writing for a moment , looks down at the ledger , then continues to write ) like he brought in the parts to that antique automobile . i was a year putting that thing together -- such as it is . a whole year putting an old car together . ( a pause ) but thank god for that car and for the hours it used up and the days and the weeks . i can look at it out there and i know it is real and reality is what i need . because what is there left that i can believe in ? the desert and the wind ? the silence ? ( more ) corry 's voice ( cont 'd ) or myself -- can i believe in myself anymore ? ( another pause ) disjointed thought ... a little crazy ... but maybe I will become like that car . inanimate . just an item sitting in the sand -- and then would i feel loneliness ? would i feel misery ? i wonder ... he slowly let us the pencil drop out of his fingers , looks down at the book . his eyes close , then he slumps forward burying his face in his arms , leaning against the table . dissolve to : ext . shack [ day ] through the window we can see corry sleeping , still by the table . there is the distant roaring sound of engines , a flash of light that shines against the side of the shack and enters the window . we see corry start , and rise and race to the door , flinging it open , peering out over the landscape . cut to : ext . desert long shot a group of three men dressed in simple uniforms not unlike pilots of today . the camera stays directly on them as they approach . into the frame from behind the camera comes corry , who is racing out to meet them . his fingers clench and unclench at his side . he takes a few fast stumbling steps toward them , then thinking better of it stops and then , giving in again , runs toward them again . close shot as they suddenly meet a few feet from one another . the head of the space group stops . this is allenby , a man in his fifties . he nods a little curtly . allenby how are you , corry ? corry all right . there is a silence now . adams , one of the other two spacemen , looks around . adams quite a place you got here , corry . corry I am so glad you like it . adams i did not say i liked it . i think it stinks . corry you do not have to live here now , do you ? adams no , but I have got to come back here four times a year . and that is eight months out of twelve , corry , away from earth . sometimes my kids do not even recognize me when i come home . corry ( very simply ) I am sorry . adams ( with a look ) I will bet you are ! but you have got it made , do not you . corry ? makes for simple living , does not it ? ( he bends down and picks up a handful of sand ) this is corry 's kingdom . ( he let us the sand run through his fingers ) right here . six thousand miles north to south . four thousand miles east to west -and all of its just like this ! the camera is on corry 's face now . he wets his lips . he wants to say something with desperate urgency . allenby sees the look , looks away a little uncomfortably for a moment . allenby we have only got a fifteen-minute layover , corry . corry wets his lips and tries to keep the supplication out of his voice . corry nobody 's checking your schedule out here . why do not we have a game of cards or something ? allenby ( shakes his head ) I am sorry , corry . this is not an arbitrary decision . if we delay our time of departure any more than fifteen minutes , that places us in a different orbital position . we would never make it back to earth . we would have to stay here at least fourteen days before this place was in position again . corry so , fourteen days ? why not have us a ball ? I have got some beer I have saved . we could play some cards , tell me what is going on back there -allenby ( with an embarrassed look at the others ) i wish we could corry , but like i said -we have only got fifteen minutes ... corry ( his voice rising and getting shaky as if losing control ) well ... well what is a few lousy days to you ? couple of card games . ( he nods toward the others ) how about you guys ? you think I will murder you or something over a bad hand ? allenby ( quietly and firmly ) I am sorry , corry . ( he starts to take corry 's arm ) let us go to the shack -corry flings off his arm , not in anger , but in desperation . corry all right . two minutes are gone now . you have got thirteen minutes left . i would not want to foul up your schedule , allenby . not for a ... ( he looks away ) not for a lousy game of cards . not for a few bottles of crummy beer . then he looks up slowly , turns to lock eyes with allenby . he seems to catch his breath for a moment . corry allenby ... what about the pardon ? adams ( squinting up toward the sky , his voice very matter of fact ) you are out of luck , corry . sentence reads fifty years and they are not even reviewing cases of homicide . you have been here four now . that makes forty-six to go , so get comfortable , dad huh ? he laughs until his eyes reach allenby 's . allenby stares at him , then wets his lips and looks away . adams 's laugh dies out . track shot as the three men head toward the shack . corry 's eyes are down , staring at the sand where his feet make crunchy sounds as they sink down over the crust of the top layer . allenby , alongside of him as they walk , looks at him intermittently . different angle as they reach a small knoll . over their shoulder we see the shack and car sitting here in mute , ugly loneliness . corry stops instinctively to stare at them . allenby touches his arm compassionately with an instinctive gentleness . allenby ( quietly ) I am sorry , corry . unfortunately , we do not make the rules . all we do is deliver your supplies and pass on information . i told you last time there is been a lot of pressure back home about this kind of punishment . there are a whole lot of people who think it is unnecessarily cruel . well who knows what the next couple of years will bring ? they may change their minds , alter the law , imprison you on earth like the old days . corry ( turns to stare intently into the older man 's face ) allenby , i have to tell you something . every morning ... every morning when i get up i tell myself that this is my last day of sanity . i will not be able to live another day of loneliness . not another day , and by noon when i can not keep my fingers still and the inside of my mouth feels like gun powder and burnt copper and deep inside my gut I have got an ache that will not go away and seems to be crawling all over the inside of my body , prickling at me , tearing little chunks out of me -- and then i think I have got to hold out for another day , just another day . ( then he turns to stare down at the shack ) but i can not keep doing that day after day for the next forty-six years . I will lose my mind , allenby . adams you are breakin ' my heart -corry whirls around to stare at him . his features contort . there is an animal-like growl that shouts out deep from his throat and suddenly , losing all control he lunges at adams , hitting him twice , crunching , desperate blows that smash against adams 's face and propel him backwards to sprawl face- first in the sand . allenby and the other officer grab corry 's arms . allenby ( shouting ) easy , corry , easy ! gradually corry let us his body relax , going the route from a trembling , shaking ague to a heavy , tired motionlessness . med . close shot adams as he rises from the sand , gingerly touches the bruise on his face . adams i would not worry about going off my rocker , corry . it is already happened . stir crazy , they used to call it . well , that is what you are now . stir crazy . allenby ( taking a step toward him to keep him back ) back off , adams . you and carstairs go back and get the supplies . bring them over to the shack . adams ( bridling ) mr. corry has a broken leg or something ? he points to corry . allenby go ahead , do as i tell you . and the big crate with the red tag -- handle that one ( more ) allenby ( cont 'd ) gently . carstairs how about the use of his buggy there ? some of the stuff 's heavy . corry ( as if shaken out of a dream softly ) it is not running today . adams ( laughs ) it is not running today ! what is the matter , corry -- use it too much , do you ? ( to carstairs ) you know , there is so many places a guy can go out here . there is the country club over the mound there and the seashore over that way , and the drive-in theater , that is someplace around here , is not it , corry ? allenby knock it off , adams , and go get the stuff . adams and carstairs turn with another look toward corry and start back across the desert . allenby takes corry 's arm and the two men walk toward the shack . long shot corry and allenby as they walk past the car and the she would and into the shack . int . shack full shot the room corry goes over to sit on the bed to stare numbly across the room at nothing . allenby crosses over to the icebox , takes out a jug of water , looks around the room and then over to corry . allenby glasses ? corry ( motions ) paper cups . on the shelf there . allenby unscrews the jar and sniffs , makes a face , then pours some water into a cup , takes it in a quick gulp . allenby we have got some fresh on board . they will be bringing it over . corry nods numbly . allenby pulls up a chair so that he is sitting directly opposite corry . allenby brought you some magazines , too . strictly on my own . corry ( nods ) thanks . allenby and some old vintage movies . sciencefiction stuff . you will get a kick out of it . corry ( nods , looks up unsmiling ) I am sure i will . allenby bites his lip and looks at corry for a long , silent moment , then he rises and crosses to the window . allenby i brought you something else , corry . it would mean my job if they suspected . ( then he turns toward corry ) it would be my neck if they found out for sure . corry look , allenby , i do not want gifts now . i do not want tidbits . it makes me feel like an animal in a cage and there is a nice old lady out there who wants to throw peanuts at me . ( more ) ( cont 'd ) ( he suddenly lashes out and grabs allenby ) a pardon , allenby , that is the only gift i want . I am not a murderer , i killed in selfdefense . a lot of people believe me and it happens to be the truth . i killed in selfdefense -allenby ( gently takes corry 's hands off of him ) i know , corry . i know all about it . ( he retraces his steps back over the chair and sits down ) i doubt if it will be much consolation to you , but it is not easy handling this kind of assignment . stopping here four times a year and having to look at a man 's agony . corry you are quite right . that is precious little consolation . there is a long , long silence . allenby rises . allenby well , i can not bring you freedom , corry . all i can do ... all i can do is to try to bring you things to help keep your sanity . ( a pause ) something ... anything so you can fight loneliness . he looks across the room and out the window . long shot through the window adams and carstairs are both lugging a small metal cart loaded down with crates and supplies . they enter the area of the shack to bring the cart up close to the front door . the two of them take a heavy crate off the top of the pile , a red tag fluttering from one end . they lay it down in the sand . carstairs ( calls ) you want this big crate opened up , captain ? med . close shot allenby allenby ( calls out ) not yet . stay out there . I will be right out . two shot corry and allenby corry I will bite , captain . what is the present ? ( he looks briefly through the window ) what is it ? he rises , goes over to the window to stare out at the long , rectangular box . med . long shot through the window of the box as it lies in the sand . med . close shot corry as he turns back toward the room . corry if it is a twenty-year supply of puzzles , I will have to decline with thanks . i do not need any puzzles , allenby . if i want to try to probe any mysteries -- i can look in the mirror and try to figure out my own . allenby ( crosses over to the door , opens it , turns back to corry ) we have got to go now . we will be back in three months . ( a pause ) are you listening to me , corry ? this is important . corry stares at him . allenby when you open up the crate there is nothing you need do . the ... item has been vacuumpacked . it needs no activator of any kind . the air will do that . there 'll be a booklet inside , too , that can answer any of your questions . corry you are mysterious as hell . allenby i do not mean to be . it is just like i told you , though -- I am risking a lot to have brought this here . ( he points to the door ) they do not know what it is i brought . I would appreciate your waiting until we get out of sight . corry ( unemotionally ) all right . have a good trip back ... give my regards to ... ( he wets his lips ) ... to broadway . and every place else while you are at it . allenby sure , corry . I will see you . he goes out the door , motions to the other two men . they start to follow him . cut to : med . close shot corry standing at the door . corry allenby ! cut to : reverse angle allenby and the other two corry 's p.o.v . the three men pause to look toward the shack . in the foreground in front of them we see the long crate lying all by itself in the sand . cut to : med . close shot corry he walks down the step and stands near the box , points to it . corry i do not much care what it is . for the thought , allenby , for the ... for the decency of it ... i thank you . med . shot allenby allenby you are quite welcome , corry . he turns and the other two follow him . long angle shot looking down at them as they slowly tramp across the sand and disappear over the line of dunes . med . close shot corry he watches them go , shading his eyes again at the sun , then very slowly he looks down at the box . he stares at it for a long moment , then he kneels down to feel its sides and finally finds the two release catches . his hands go out to touch them simultaneously . he pushes them , and very slowly the top of the box opens . tight close angle shot looking up as from inside the box toward corry 's face as he stares into it . his eyes suddenly widen with astonishment . cut abruptly to : med . close shot insert section of a space craft what we are seeing is just part of a hatch and a metal ladder . carstairs is just clambering up them to disappear inside this ship . adams starts to follow him . he pauses halfway up to look toward allenby , who in turn is staring off into the distance . adams captain -- just man to man , huh ? allenby what ? adams what did you bring him ? what was in the box ? med . close shot allenby as he slowly scratches the beard stubble of his square jaw . allenby ( very softly as if to no one in particular ) I am not sure really . maybe just an illusion -- or maybe salvation . then he turns , motions adams up the ladder , and then follows him up . dissolve to : ext . the shack the top of the box has been opened and as the camera pans over it toward the shack we see that it is empty . the camera continues to pan over to the shack . dissolve through to : int . shack corry stands at the far end of the room staring off beyond the camera . he has a book in his hand which he suddenly seems to remember . he looks down at it , stares at the cover for a long moment , then opens it with both his hands . he studies it perplexed for a long moment ; then he looks up again . then he looks down at the book again and slowly he reads aloud . corry you are now the proud owner of a robot built in the form of a woman . to all intent and purpose this creature is a woman . physiologically and psychologically she is a human being with a set of emotions , a memory track , the ability to reason , to think , and to speak . she is beyond illness and under normal circumstances should have a life span similar to that of a comparable human being . her name is alicia . very slowly corry 's head rises . slow pan shot across the room to a shot of alicia who sits in a chair looking back at him . while she looks human , there is something too immobile , too emotionless about her features . there is a deadness to the eyes when they look back at him , showing neither resignation nor interest and only bare awareness . she is dressed in a simple loose , flowing garment that neither adds to nor detracts from her femininity . corry takes a few hesitant steps toward her , his eyes wide , a fright working its way out . his mouth moves but nothing comes . close shot the girl alicia that is my name -- alicia . what is yours ? close shot corry he stops dead in his tracks and suddenly he looks horrified , sick with distaste . he shakes his head from side to side and backs away . corry ( in a very low voice ) get out of here . ( now a shout ) get out of here ! i do not want any machine in here ! go on , get out of here ! with an effort he grabs the girl and propels her out the door and slams it behind her . then he leans against the door , eyes closed , breathing heavily and gradually his composure comes back . he takes a few steps back toward the center of the room . in the process he looks toward the window . long shot through the window the girl stands there in the yard staring at him . fade to black : end act one act two fade on : ext . desert corry 's shack in foreground int . shack corry is in the process of putting up a shelf . he stands on a small aluminum ladder , pounding with hammer and nails . the sweat pours down his face . he tests the shelf , then gets down off the ladder , picks up a towel and wipes his face , suddenly looks down at his feet . close shot bucket of water camera pulls back for shot of alicia standing there . corry well ? alicia i brought you some water . where shall i put it ? corry just leave it there and get out . alicia it will get warm just sitting there . corry ( takes a glass , dips it in the water ) you would know , huh ? he takes a drink . alicia i can feel thirst . corry wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and looks at her intensely . close shot corry as he stares at her . the same look of abhorrence as if clinically examining some foreign object . close shot the girl her eyes go down and she turns away . two shot corry what else can you feel ? alicia i do not understand -corry i suppose you can feel heat and cold ? how about pain ? can you feel pain ? alicia ( nods softly ) that too . corry takes a step over toward her , looking down at her . corry how ? how can you ? you are a machine , am not you ? alicia ( whispering ) yes . corry of course you are . so why did not they build you to look like a machine ? why am not you made out of metal with nuts and bolts sticking out of you ? with wires and electrodes and things like that ? ( his face contorts now and his voice rises ) why do they turn you into a lie ? why do they cover you with what looks like flesh ? why do they give you a face ? a face that if i look at long enough makes me think ... makes me believe that ... his hands grab her shoulders and go up past her neck to cup her face in a hard , painful grasp . alicia closes her eyes against the pain . alicia corry -he releases her , strides past her and out the door . cut to : ext . the shack corry stands halfway to the car , his back to the shack . corry you mock me , you know that ? when you look at me . when you talk to me -- I am being mocked . alicia I am sorry . ( then she slowly reaches up , feels of her neck and shoulders ) you hurt me , corry . corry ( turns to her , walks over very close to her ) hurt you ? how could i hurt you ? ( he grabs her again ) this is not flesh . there am not any nerves under there . there am not any tendons or muscles . he suddenly pushes her bodily away . cut to : flash shot as she sprawls head first into the sand . two shot then in the same fury that knows neither logic nor understanding , he searches wildly around and then picks up a shovel . he holds it by the handle and brandishes it up high . he shouts at her . corry you know what you are ? you are like that broken-down heap I have got sitting in the yard . you are a hunk of metal with arms and legs instead of wheels . but that heap does not mock me like you do . it does not look at me with make-believe eyes and talk to me with a make-believe voice . ( he takes a step toward her , now the shovel up high ) well listen you ... listen machine , I am sick at being mocked by a ghost . by a memory of women . and that is all you are . you are a reminder to me that I am so lonely I am about to lose my mind . and now his face is completely contorted , wild-eyed . he raises the shovel and is about to bring it down on her . angle shot looking down at her she looks up at him and then her eyes close and tears appear . then when she opens her eyes again we look at her as from a new and fresh perspective . the face is no longer inanimate , no longer immobile . it now has depth , emotion . it is filled with the nuances and mysteries of the woman and there is a beauty now that shines out . reverse angle looking up at corry as he reacts . he hesitates and then let us the shovel drop out of his hand onto the sand . very , very slowly he kneels down to crouch very close to her . his hand reaches out and touches the tears on her face and now his voice is gentle . corry you can cry too , can not you ? alicia ( nods ) with reason . and i can feel loneliness , too . corry takes her arm and helps her to her feet , then stands very close to her , looking down at her face . corry we will go back inside now . we will eat our dinner . alicia all right . she starts to walk on ahead of him . corry alicia . she turns to look at him . corry i do not care ... i do not care how you we are born ... or made . you are flesh and blood to me . you are a woman . ( a pause ) you are my companion , alicia . i need you desperately . close shot alicia she smiles . alicia and i need you , corry . he goes up to walk alongside of her . long angle shot looking down on them as they walk toward the shack . lap dissolve to : ext . shack porch [ day ] med . close shot corry as he sits in the homemade rocker . he looks off toward the horizon and then slowly begins to write as we hear his voice . corry 's voice alicia has been with me now for eleven months . twice when allenby has brought the ship in with supplies I have hidden her so that the others would not see her and I have seen the question in allenby 's eyes each time . it is a question i have myself . it is difficult to write down what has been the sum total of this very strange and bizarre relationship . it is man and woman , man and machine , and there are times even when i know that alicia is simply an extension of me . i hear my words coming from her . my emotions . the things that she has learned to love are those things that I have loved . he stops abruptly as he listens to alicia singing from inside the shack , he smiles and then continues to write again . corry 's voice but i think I have reached the point now where i shall not analyze alicia any longer . i shall accept her here simply as a part of my life -- an integral part . he continues to write silently now , turning the page to continue on the other side , and then he stops , puts the book and pencil down , rises , goes to the door and stands there looking at alicia , she turns to smile at him and he enters the room . the camera moves back so that it is shooting at them through the open door and across the ledger book which lies face up . we hear corry 's voice . corry 's voice because I am not lonely any longer . each day can now be lived with ... ( a pause ) i love alicia . nothing else matters . dissolve to : ext . desert [ night ] long shot looking up toward a mound of sand as hand in hand alicia and corry race down toward the camera . he stops her abruptly and points to the sky . corry alicia , look . that is the star , betelgeuse . it is in the constellation of orion . and there is the `` great bear '' with its pointer stars in line with the northern star . and there is the constellation hercules . you see , alicia ? he traces a path across the sky with his upraised hand and her eyes follow it . then he turns to look down at her face upturned in the half-light . alicia ( softly ) god 's beauty . corry ( nods ) that is right , alicia . god 's beauty . suddenly the girl 's eyes stop as they traverse the sky . she points . alicia that star , corry ? what is that star ? close shot corry as he stares at something in the sky . corry that is not a star . that is a ship , alicia . alicia a ship ? very slowly there is a ray of light that plays on both their faces and gets brighter and larger . alicia moves closer to him . alicia there is no ship due here now , corry . you said not for another three months . you said after the last time it would not be for ( more ) alicia ( cont 'd ) another -corry ( thoughtfully ) it must be allenby 's ship . it is the only one that ever comes close . they stop at other asteroids , then come here . ( he looks away again , pensively ) that means they will probably be here in the morning . ( another pause ) i wonder why . alicia ( takes a few steps toward him , concerned ) corry -- what is it mean ? corry ( turns to her and smiles ) in the morning ... we will find out . come on , let us go back to the house . dissolve to : ext . desert [ day ] long shot top of dunes three space-suited figures appear . allenby 's in the foreground . he suddenly stops and looks toward the camera as corry steps in front of it and into the frame . allenby hello , corry . we wondered where you we are . corry you have trouble ? allenby no , we had no trouble . he motions the others to follow him and they walk down the dune to stand close to corry . allenby this is a scheduled stop . adams we have got good news for you , corry . corry ( looks from face to face ) I am not interested . the others exchange looks of surprise . allenby you better hear what it is . corry you heard me , allenby . I am not interested . allenby you will be . this i guarantee ! corry takes a few backward steps looking paranoically from one to the other . corry allenby , give me a break , will you ? i do not want trouble . allenby we do not either . adams ( to one of the others ) he gets worse ! if we would come a month later he would have been eating sand or something . corry now turns and starts to walk away from them , occasionally looking over his shoulder . allenby ( calls out to him ) corry ! track shot corry as he walks faster and faster and is about to break into a dead run . cut to : long shot over corry 's shoulder looking at allenby who now shouts . allenby corry ! he runs , crunching on the hard sand , to come up close to corry , he grabs him , whirls him around . allenby it is this way , corry , all the sentences have been reviewed . they have given you a pardon , we are to take you back home on the ship , but we have got to take off from here in exactly twenty minutes , we can not wait any longer . we have been dodging meteor storms all the way out . we are almost out of fuel . any longer than twenty minutes we will have passed the point of departure and then i do not think we would ever make it . corry stares at him and then at the other men who have come down the dune behind him . tight close shot corry his eyes dart about , going wide as the sense of what is been said to him seeps in . he tries to speak , but for a moment nothing comes out . corry wait a minute , allenby . wait just a minute . ( he closes his eyes tightly , then opens them ) what did you just say ? what did you just say about a -allenby ( filling it in ) a pardon . adams ( coming up alongside ) but it will not do any of us any good unless you get your stuff together and get ready ( more ) adams ( cont 'd ) to move , corry . we have picked up seven other men off asteroids and we have only got room for about fifteen pounds of stuff , so you would better pick up what you need in a hurry and leave the rest of it behind . ( then with a grin , looking off in the direction of the shack ) such as it is . corry ( struggling to keep his voice firm but already it begins to shake with joy and excitement ) stuff ? my stuff ? i do not even have fifteen pounds of stuff ! he laughs uproaringly , turns , and again starts to walk toward the shack . track shot all of them as they walk corry 's voice goes up and down in uncontrollable laughter , a combination of nerves , relief and almost unbeatable excitement . the words spew out as he walks . corry I have got a shirt , a pencil and a ledger book . a pair of shoes . ( then he throws back his head and laughs again ) the car you can keep here . that 'll be for the next poor devil . allenby ( evenly ) there will not be any next poor devil . there will not be any more exiles , corry . this was the last time . corry good ! wonderful ! thank god for that ! they continue to walk again . corry we will let it rest here then . the farthest auto graveyard in the universe ! and alicia and i will wave to it as we leave . we will just look out of a porthole and throw it a kiss goodbye . the car , the shack , the salt lakes , the range . the whole works ! alicia and i will just -he stops abruptly , suddenly conscious of the silence and the looks . pan shot across the faces of the other men as they stare at him . adams ( his eyes narrow ) who ? who , corry ? tight close shot allenby his eyes close for a moment . allenby ( sotto ) oh my dear god , i forgot her ! group shot corry 's eyes move around from face to face . corry allenby - ( and then accusative ) allenby , it is alicia -carstairs ( whispers under his breath to adams ) he is out of his mind , is not he ? adams who is alicia , corry ? corry ( laughs uproariously ) who is alicia ? adams , you idiot ! who is alicia ! you brought her ! you brought her here in a box ! she is a woman - ( and then he stops , looks away for a moment , softly , then looks toward allenby ) a robot . ( and then once again looks at allenby ) but closer to a woman . she is kept me alive , allenby . i swear to you -- if it were not for her -he looks around again at the circle of silent faces that stare at him . close shot corry corry what is the matter ? you worried about alicia ? ( he shakes his head ) you need not be . alicia 's harmless . i tell you she is like a woman . and she is gentle and kind and without her , allenby , i tell you without her I would have been finished . I would have given up . ( a long pause and then very quietly ) you would have only had to come back to bury me ! group shot adams ( to allenby ) that is what you would not let us look at , huh ? the crate with the red tag -corry ( to allenby ) sorry , captain , but i had to let it out -- allenby that is all right , corry . that is all over with , but unfortunately that is not the problem -corry ( again with a high uncontrollable laugh ) problem ? there am not any problems ! there are no more problems left on heaven or earth ! we will pack up fifteen pounds of stuff and we will climb in that ship of yours and when we get back to that beautiful green earth -tight close shot corry corry ( he whispers it ) fifteen pounds . ( and then he shouts it ) fifteen pounds ? ( he looks from face to face again ) you have got to have room for more than that . throw out stuff . throw out equipment . alicia weighs more than fifteen pounds . group shot allenby ( quietly ) that is the point , corry . we are stripped now . we have got room for you and nothing else except that ledger of yours and the pencil . ( he shakes his head ) you will have to leave the robot here . corry ( shouting ) she is not just a robot , allenby . you do not understand . you leave her behind -- that is murder . allenby ( shakes his head ) I am sorry , corry -- i do not have any choice -corry ( backing away , his voice desperate ) no , allenby . you do not understand . you can not leave her behind . ( and then he screams ) alicia , come here ! ( then he turns to them ) you will see . you will see why you can not leave her behind . ( then he shouts again ) alicia ! long angle shot looking down as corry races toward the shack followed by the others . cut abruptly to : int . shack as corry smashes open the door and races inside only to find the room empty . he stands in the middle of the room looking around and then over toward the door as allenby enters followed by the other men . allenby where is she , corry ? corry i do not know . but when you see her you will know why you can not leave her behind . adams look , corry . we just want you to get your gear packed and get out of here . ( he looks at his watch , nervously to allenby ) we have only got about ten minutes . how about it , captain ? allenby ( gently ) come on , corry . corry ( backs further into the room ) no ! I am not leaving , allenby . i told you that . i can not leave . allenby you do not understand . this is our last trip here . this is anybody 's last trip . this is off the route now . that means no supplies , no nothing . that means it you stay here you die here . and that way , there would be a day , corry , when you would pray for that death to come quicker than it is bargained for -corry ( illogically , half- wildly ) i can not help it allenby . i can not leave her behind . and you will not take her . so that means i stay . ( and then looking over his shoulder wildly , he screams ) alicia ! come here , alicia ! let them see you . do not be afraid -close shot allenby allenby corry , listen to me . i saw this ... this thing get crated , shoved into a box . corry ( shakes his head ) i do not care . allenby she is a machine , corry . she is a motor with wires and tubes and batteries . corry ( screaming ) she is a woman ! allenby wets his lips , bites his lip for a moment standing there unsure , not knowing what to do . through the window , outside in the yard , we see another member of the crew walk through the yard , pause near the shack . crewman captain ? captain allenby ? allenby what ? crewman captain , we have got just four minutes left . we have got to take off ! if we wait longer than that , sir , we will have moved to a point too far out . i do not think we will make it , sir . adams ( his voice frightened ) how about it , captain allenby , leave him here ! allenby we can not leave him here . sick mad , or halfalive , we have got to bring him back . those are the orders . he takes another step toward corry who backs against the wall . allenby corry , now it is not just you . now it is all of us . so that means we can not talk any more and we can not argue with you . we simply just have to take you ! he makes a quick motion with one hand . adams and carstairs take a step into the room to flank allenby and to converge on corry . corry , with a kind of animal shout bulls his way past them pushing adams out of the way and bolts out of the door . cut to : long angle shot looking down on the desert at the figure of corry as he races , stumbling , falling , picking himself up again . his voice can be heard shouting over and over again . corry ( shouting ) alicia ! alicia ! different angles of him running the others in pursuit . long angle shot looking up toward a dune as he suddenly appears at the top and stares down . camera sweeps to the left and down for a shot of alicia standing alone down in the depression of the sand . full shot the place corry alicia ! behind him allenby and the others appear , corry starts toward the girl , carstairs tackles him and then adams pounces on him , they hold him tight as he shouts . corry alicia , talk to them . tell them you are a woman -allenby takes a few steps down the dune and stops halfway down . he looks back at corry . allenby I am sorry , corry , i do not have any choice . ( a pause . his voice is quiet ) i have no choice at all . close shot his hand as it unbuckles the gun holster on his belt . tight close shot corry his eyes go wide . corry ( screams ) no , allenby ! no ! she is a human being ! flash shot behind alicia looking straight up at the dune at allenby , who takes the gun out and fires directly into her face . angle shot looking up toward the back of alicia as very slowly she crumples to the sand blotting out the camera momentarily . close shot corry his fingers convulsively move away from his face and fall to his side . he takes three slow steps down the dune toward the crumpled figure . then he looks down . pan shot with his eyes to a close shot of alicia 's hand clenched tightly . a further pan shot across her arm and shoulder to the back of her head . then a very slow pan shot two or three feet across the ground to a shot of the remnants of a broken machine , twisted and bent wires , a cracked eye , a couple of fragments of plastic , all the remains of a face . group shot the men with corry in the foreground . a few feet behind him is allenby , and then on the dune are the others . crewman comes into the frame in the background . crewman it is got to be now , captain allenby ! allenby ( nods , softly ) it will be now ! ( then he turns to corry ) come on , corry . it is time to go home . now numbly , without direction , corry allows himself to be led up the dune and across the desert . long angle shot looking down on them as they walk . the light from the ship gets brighter and brighter as they approach it . close group shot as they pause for a moment , corry looks back at the crumpled figure in the distance , then again turns and begins to walk . track shot with them as their feet crunch on the sand past the she would , the car and all the rest of it . allenby ( alongside corry ) it is all behind you now , corry . all behind you . like a bad dream . a nightmare ... and when you wake up you will be on earth . you will be home . corry home ? allenby that is right . ( a long pause , putting his hand on corry 's arm ) all you are leaving behind corry , is loneliness . tight close shot corry 's face as the tears roll down his cheeks . his eyes move down to the sand by his feet and for a moment his face is impassive and immobile . he nods slowly . corry i must remember to ... i must remember to keep that in mind ! then he turns to walk ahead of the others . long angle shot looking down at the little group of men as they pass the shack and then move away into the night toward the distant light that flickers on them , beckons them away . the camera pans them and up into the starry night sky . narrator 's voice down below , on a microscopic piece of sand that floats through space , is a fragment of a man 's life . left to rust is the place he lived in and the machines he used . without use they will disintegrate from the wind and the sand and the years that act upon them . all of mr. corry 's machines ... including the one made in his image , kept alive by love , but now ... obsolete ... in the twilight zone ! fade to black : the end
10|Twilight Zone|The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street|March 4, 1960|`` the monsters are due on maple street '' by rod serling act i [ fade in on a shot of the sky ... the various nebulae , and planet bodies stand out in sharp , sparkling relief . as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens ] narrator 's voice there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man . it is a dimension as vast as space , and as timeless as infinity . it is the middle ground between light and shadow — between science and superstition . and it lies between the pit of man 's fears and the summit of his knowledge . this is the dimension of imagination . it is an area which we call the twilight zone . [ the camera has begun to pandoi/wv until it passes the horizon and on a sign which reads , `` maple street. `` pandownuntil we are shooting down at an angle toward the street below . i t 's a tree-lined , quiet residential american street , very typical of the small town . the houses have front porches on which people sit and swing on gliders , conversing across from house to house . steve brand polishes his car parked in front of his house . h is neighbor , don martin , leans against the fender watching him . a good humor man rides a bicycle and is just in the process ofstopping to sell some ice cream to a couple ofkids . two women gossip on the front lawn . another man waters his lawn . ] narrator 's voice maple street , you.s.a. , late summer . a tree—lined little world of front porch gliders , hop scotch , the laughter of children , and the bell of an ice cream vendor . [ there is a pause and the camera moves over to a shot of the good humor man and two small boys who are standing alongside , just buying ice cream ] narrator 's voice at the sound of the roar and the ﬂash of light it will be precisely 6:43 p.m. on maple street . [ at this moment one of the little boys , tommy , looks up to listen to a sound of a tremendous screeching roar from overhead . a ﬂash oflight plays on both their faces and then it moves down the street past lawns and porches and rooftops and then disappears . various people leave their porches and stop what they 're doing to stare up at the sky . steve brand , the man who is been polishing his car and now he stands there transﬁxed , staring upwards . he looks at don martin , his neighbor from across the street ] steve what was that ? a meteor ? don [ nods ] that is what it looked like . i did not hear any crash , though , did you ? steve [ shakes his heacﬂ nope . i did not hear anything except a roar . mrs. brand [ from her porch ] steve ? what was that ? steve [ raising his voice and looking toward porch ] guess it was a meteor , honey . came awful close , did not it ? mrs. brand too close for my money ! much too close . [ the camera pans across the various porches to people who stand there watching and talking in low conversing tones . ] narrator 's voice maple street . six—forty—four p.m. , on a late september evening . [ a pause ] maple street in the last calm and reﬂective moments ... before the monsters came ! [ the camera slowly pans across the porches again . we see a man screwing a light bulb on a front porch , then getting down oﬂ the stool to ﬂick the switch and ﬁnding that nothing happens . another man is working on an electric power mower . he plugs in the plug , ﬂicks on the switch of the power mower , oﬂ and on , with nothing happening . through the window of a front porch , we see a woman pushing her ﬁnger back and forth on the dial hook . her voice is indistinct and distant , but intelligible and repetitive ] woman operator , operator , something 's wrong on the phone , operator ! [ mrs. brand comes out on the porch and calls to steve ] mrs. brand [ calling . ] steve , the power 's off . i had the soup on the stove and the stove just stopped working . woman same thing over here . i can not get anybody on the phone either . the phone seems to be dead . [ we look down the street as we hear the voices creep up from down below , small , mildly disturbed voices , highlighting these kinds of phrases : ] voices electricity 's off . phone will not work . can not get a thing on the radio . my power motor will not move , will not work at all . radio 's gone dead . [ pete van horn , a tall , thin man is seen standing in front of his house . ] van horn I will cut through the backyard ... see if the power 's still on floral street . I will be right back . [ he walks past the side of his house and disappears into the backyard . the hammer on van horn 's hip as he walks . the camera pans down slowly until we 're looking at ten or eleven people standing around the street and overﬂowing to the curb and sidewalk . in the background is steve brand ' 5 car . ] steve does not make sense . why should the power go off all of a sudden , and the phone line ? don maybe some sort of an electrical storm or something . charlie that do not seem likely . sky 's just as blue as anything . not a cloud . no lightning . no thunder . no nothing . how could it be a storm ? woman i can not get a thing on the radio . not even the portable . [ the people again murmur softly in wonderment and question ] charlie well why do not you go downtown and check with the police , though they will probably think we are crazy or something . a little power failure and right away we get all ﬂustered and everything . steve it is not just the power failure , charlie . if it was , we would still be able to get a broadcast on the portable . [ there is a murmur of reaction to this . steve looks from face to face and then over to his car . ] steve I will run downtown . we will get this all straightened out . [ he walks over to the car , gets in it , turns the key . beyond it we see the crowd watching him from the other side . steve starts the engine . it turns over sluggishly and thenjust stops dead . he tries it again and this time he can ' 1 ‘ get it to turn over . then , very slowly and reﬂectively , he turns the key back to `` oﬁ '' and then slowly gets out of the car . as they stare at steve . he stands for a moment by the car , then walks toward the group . ] steve don steve woman charlie steve i do not understand it . it was working fine before ... out of gas ? [ shakes his heacﬂ i just had it filled up . what is it mean ? it is just as if ... as if everything had stopped ... [ then he turns toward steve ] we would better walk downtown . [ another murmur of assent at this . ] the two of us can go , charlie . [ he turns to look back at the car . ] it could not be the meteor . a meteor could not do this . [ he and charlie exchange a look , then they start to walk away from the group . we see tommy , a serious-facedfourteen-year—old in spectacles who stands a few feet away from the group , halfway between them and the two men who start to walk down the sidewalk ] tommy steve tommy steve tommy steve charlie tommy mr. brand ... you better not ! why not ? they do not want you to . [ steve and charlie exchange a grin and steve looks back toward the boy . ] who does not want us to ? [ jerks his head in the general direction of the distant horizon ] them ! them ? who are them ? [ very intently ] whoever was in that thing that came by overhead . [ steve knits his brows for a moment , cocking his head questioningly . his voice is intense ] steve what ? tommy whoever was in the thing that came over . i do not think they want us to leave here . [ steve leaves charlie and walks over to the boy . he kneels down in front of him . he forces his voice to remain gentle . he reaches out and holds the boy . ] steve what do you mean ? what are you talking about ? tommy they do not want us to leave . that is why they shut everything off . steve what makes you say that ? whatever gave you that idea ? woman [ from the crowd . ] now is not that the craziest thing you ever heard ? tommy [ persistently but a little intimidated by the crowd . ] it is always that way , in every story i ever read about a ship landing from outer space . woman [ to the boy 's mother , sally , who stands on the fringe of the crowd . ] from outer space , yet ! sally , you better get that boy of yours up to bed . he is been reading too many comic books or seeing too many movies or something . sally tommy , come over here and stop that kind of talk . steve go ahead , tommy . we will be right back . and you will see . that was not any ship or anything like it . that was just a ... a meteor or something . likely as no —— [ he turns to the group , now trying to weight his words with an optimism he obviously doesn'tfeel but is desperately trying to instill in himself as well as the others . ] steve no doubt it did have something to do with all this power failure and the rest of it . meteors can do some crazy things . like sunspots . don [ picking up the cue . ] sure . that is the kind of thing — like sunspots . they raise cain with radio reception all over the world . and this thing being so close — why there is no telling the sort of stuff it can do . [ he wets his lips , smiles nervously ] go ahead , charlie . you and steve go into town and see if that is not what is causing it all . [ steve and charlie again walk away from the group down the sidewalk . the people watch silently . tommy stares at them , biting his lips and ﬁnally calling out again . ] tommy mr. brand ! [ the two men stop again . tommy takes a step toward them . ] tommy mr. brand ... please do not leave here . [ steve and charlie can be seen beyond them . they stop once again and turn toward the boy . there is a murmur in the crowd , a murmur of irritation and concern as if the boy we are bringing up fears that should not be brought up ; words which carried with them a strange kind of validity that came without logic but nonetheless registered and had meaning and eﬁ ‘ ect . again the murmur of reaction from the crowd . tommy is partlyfrightened and partly deﬁant as well . ] tommy you might not even be able to get to town . it was that way in the story . nobody could leave . nobody except—— steve except who ? tommy except the people they had sent down ahead of them . they looked just like humans . and it was not until the ship landed that— [ the boy suddenly stops again , conscious of the parents staring at them and of the sudden hush of the crowd . ] sally [ in a whisper , sensing the antagonism of the crowd . ] tommy , please son ... honey , do not talk that way—— man one that kid should not talk that way ... and we should not stand here listening to him . why this is the craziest thing i ever heard of . the kid tells us a comic book plot and here we stand listenin—— [ steve walks toward the camera , stops by the boy . ] steve go ahead , tommy . what kind of story was this ? what about the people that they sent out ahead ? tommy that was the way they prepared things for the landing . they sent four people . a mother and a father and two kids who looked just like humans ... but they were not . [ there is another silence as steve looks toward the crowd and then toward tommy . he wears a tight grin . ] steve well , i guess what we would better do then is to run a check on the neighborhood and see which ones of us are really human . [ there is laughter at this , but it is a laughter that comes from a desperate attempt to lighten the atmosphere . i t 's a release kind of laugh . the people look at one another in the middle of their laughter . ] charlie there must be something ' better to do than stand around makin ' bum jokes about it . [ rubs his jaw nervously ] i wonder if floral street 's got the same deal we got . [ he looks past the houses . ] where is pete van horn anyway ? did not he get back yet ? suddenly there is the sound of a car 's engine starting to turn over . [ suddenly there is a sound of a car 's engine starting to turn over . we look across the street toward the driveway of les goodman 's house . he is at the wheel trying to start the car . ] sally can you get it started , les ? goodman no dice . [ he walks toward the group . he stops suddenly as behind him , inexplicably and with a noise that inserts itselfinto the silence , the car engine starts up all by itself . goodman whirls around to stare toward it . the car idles roughly , smoke coming from the exhaust , the frame shaking gently . goodman 's eyes go wide , and he runs over to his car . the people stare at the car . ] man one he got the car started somehow . he got his car started ! [ the people stare , somehow caught up by this revelation and somehow , illogically , wildly , frightened . woman how come his car just up and started like that ? sally all by itself . he was not anywheres near it . it started all by itself . [ don approaches the group , stops a few feet away to look toward goodman 's car and then back toward the group . ] don and he never did come out to look at that thing that ﬂew overhead . he was not even interested . [ he turns to the faces in the group , his face taut and serious . ] why ? why did not he come out with the rest of us to look ? charlie he always was an oddball . him and his whole family . real oddball . don what do you say we ask him ? [ the group suddenly starts towards the house . in this brieffraction of a moment they take the ﬁrst step toward performing a metamorphosis that changes people from a group into a mob . they begin to head purposefully across the street toward the house at the end . steve stands in front of them . for a moment their fear almost turns their walk into a wild stampede , but steve 's voice , loud , incisive , and commanding , makes them stop . ] steve wait a minute ... wait a minute ! let us not be a mob ! [ the people stop as a group , seem to pause for a moment , and then much more quietly and slowly start to walk across the street . goodman stands there alonefacing the people ] goodman i just do not understand it . i tried to start it and it would not start . you saw me . all of you saw me . [ and now , just as suddenly as the engine started , it stops and there is a long silence that is gradually intruded upon by the frightened murmuring of the people . ] goodman i do not understand . i swear ... i do not understand . what is happening ? don maybe you better tell us . nothing 's working on this street . nothing . no lights , no power , no radio . [ and then meaningfully ] nothing except one car — yours ! [ the people pick this up and now their murmuring becomes a loud chant ﬁlling the air with accusations and demands for action . two of the men pass don and head toward goodman who backs away , backing into his car and now at bay . ] goodman wait a minute now . you keep your distance — all of you . so I have got a car that starts by itself — well that is a freak thing , i admit it . but does that make me some kind of criminal or something ? i do not know why the car works — it just does ! [ this stops the crowd momentarily , and now goodman , still backing away , goes toward his front porch . he goes up the steps and then stops to standfacing the mob . we see steve as he comes through the crowd . ] steve [ quietly ] we are all on a monster kick , les . seems that the general impression holds that maybe one family is not what we think they are . monsters from outer space or something . different that us . fifth columnists from the vast beyond . [ h e chuckles ] you know anybody that might fit that description around here on maple street ? goodman what is this , a gag or something ? this a practical joke or something ? [ we see a close up of a porch light that suddenly goes out . there is a murmur from the group . ] goodman woman goodman steve charlie woman now , i suppose that is supposed to incriminate me ! the light goes on and off . that really does it , does not it ? [ he looks around the faces of the people ] ijust do not understand this—— [ he wets his lips , looking from face to face . ] look , you all know me . we have lived here five years . right in this house . we are no different than any of the rest of you ! we are no different at all . really ... this whole thing is just ... j ust weird—— well , if that is the case , les goodman , explain why— [ she stops suddenly , clamping her mouth shut ] [ softly ] explain what ? [ interjecting . ] look , let us forget this—— [ overlapping him . ] go ahead , let her talk . what about it ? explain what ? [ a little reluctantly ] well ... sometimes i go to bed late at night . a couple of times ... a couple of times I would come out on the porch and I would see mr. goodman here in the wee hours of the morning standing out in front of his house ... looking up at the sky . [ she looks around the circle of faces . ] that is right . looking up at the sky as if ... as if he we are waiting for something . [ a pause . ] as if he we are looking for something . [ there is a murmur of reaction from the crowd again . as goodman starts toward them , they back awayfrightened . ] goodman you know really ... this is for laughs . you know what I am guilty of ? [ h e laughs . ] I am guilty of insomnia . now what is the penalty for insomnia ? [ at this point the laugh , the humor , leaves his voice . ] did you hear what i said ? i said it was insomnia . [ a pause as he looks around , then shouts . ] i said it was insomnia ! you fools . you scared , frightened rabbits , you . you are sick people , do you know that ? you are sick people — all of you ! and you do not even know what you are starting because let me tell you ... let me tell you — this thing you are starting — that should frighten you . as god is my witness ... you are letting something begin here that is a nightmare ! act 11 [ we see a medium shot of the goodman entry hall at night . on the side table rests an unlit candle . mrs. goodman walks into scene , a glass of milk in hand . she sets the milk down on the table , lights the candle with a match from a box on the table , picks up the glass of milk , and starts out of scene . mrs. goodman comes through her porch door , glass of milk in hand . the entry hall , with table and lit candle , can be seen behind her . outside the camera takes a slow pan down the sidewalk , taking in little knots of people who stand around talking in low voices . at the end of each conversation they look toward les goodman 's house . from the various houses we can see candlelight but no electricity , and there is an all-pervading quiet that blankets the whole area , disturbed only by the almost whispered voices of the people as they stand around . the camera pans over to one group where charlie stands . he stares across at goodman 's house . two men stand across the street in almost sentry-like poses . ] sally [ a little timorously . ] it just does not seem right , though , keeping watch on them . why ... he was right when he said he was one of our neighbors . why , I have known ethel goodman ever since they moved in . we have been good friends—— charlie that do not prove a thing . any guy who 'd spend his time lookin ' up at the sky early in the morning — well there is something wrong with that kind of a person . there is something that have not legitimate . maybe under normal circumstances we could let it go by , but these am not normal circumstances . why , look at this street ! nothing ' but candles . why , it is like going ' back into the dark ages or something ' ! [ from several yards down as steve walks down the steps of his porch , walks down the street over to les goodman 's house , and then stops at the foot of the steps . goodman stands there , his wife behind him , veryfrightened . ] goodman j ust stay right where you are , steve . we do not want any trouble , but this time if anybody sets foot on my porch , that is what they are going to get — trouble ! steve look , les—— goodman I have already explained to you people . i do not sleep very well at night sometimes . i get up and i take a walk and i look up at the sky . i look at the stars ! mrs. goodman steve that is exactly what he does . why this whole thing , it is ... it is some kind of madness or something . [ nods grimly ] that is exactly what it is — some kind of madness . charlie 's voice steve woman charlie steve charlie don charlie [ shrill , from across the street ] you best watch who you are seen with steve ! until we get this all straightened out , you have not exactly above suspicion yourself . [ whirling around toward him . ] or you , charlie . or any of us , it seems . from age eight on up ! what I would like to know is , what are we going to do ? j ust stand around here all night ? there is nothing ' else we can do ! [ he turns back looking toward steve and goodman again . ] one of 'em 'll tip their hand . they got to . [ raising his voice . ] there is something you can do , charlie . you could go home and keep your mouth shut . you could quit strutting around like a self—appointed hanging judge and just climb into bed and forget it . you sound real anxious to have that happen , steve . i think we better keep our eye on you too ! [ as if he we are taking the bit in his teeth , takes a hesitant step to the front . ] i think everything might as well come out now . [ he turns toward steve ] your wife 's done plenty of talking , steve , about how odd you are ! [ picking this up , his eyes widening . ] go ahead , tell us what she is said . [ steve walks toward them from across the street ] steve go ahead , what is my wife said ? let us get it all out . let us pick out every idiosyncrasy of every single man , woman , and child on the street . and then we might as well set up some kind of a kangaroo court . how about a firing squad at dawn , charlie , so we can get rid of all the suspects ? narrow them down . make it easier for you . don there is no need gettin ' so upset , steve . it is just that ... well ... myra 's talked about how there is been plenty of nights you spend hours down in your basement workin ' on some kind of radio of something . well , none of us have ever seen that radio—— [ by this time steve has reached the group . he stands there deﬁantly close to them . ] charlie steve go ahead , steve . what kind of `` radio set '' you workin ' on ? i never seen it . neither has anyone else . who you talk to on that radio set ? and who talks to you ? I am surprised at you , charlie . how come you are so dense all of a sudden ? [ a pause . ] who do i talk to ? i talk to monsters from outer space . i talk to three— headed green men who ﬂy over here in what look like meteors . [ steve 's wife steps down from the porch , bites her lip , calls out ] mrs. brand steve charlie steve steve ! steve , please . [ then looking around frightened , she walks toward the group . it is just a ham radio set , that is all . i bought him a book on it myself . it is just a ham radio set . a lot of people have them . i can show it to you . it is right down in the basement . [ whirls around toward her . ] show them nothing ! if they want to look inside our house — let them get a search warrant . look , buddy , you can not afford to—— [ interrupting . ] charlie , do not tell me what i can afford ! and stop telling me who is dangerous and who is not and who is safe and who is a menace . [ he turns to the group and shouts . ] and you are with him too — all of you ! you are standing here all set to crucify — all set to ﬁnd a scapegoat — all desperate to point some kind of a finger at a neighbor ! well now look , friends , the only thing that is going to happen is that we will eat each other up alive—— [ he stops abruptly as charlie suddenly grabs his arm . ] charlie [ in a hushed voice . ] that is not the only thing that can happen to us . [ cut to a long shot looking down the street . a figure has suddenly materialized in the gloom and in the silence we can hear the clickety—clack of slow , measured footsteps on concrete as the ﬁgure walks slowly toward them . one of the women let us out a stiﬂed cry . the young mother grabs her boy as do a couple of others . ] tommy [ shouting , frightened . ] it is the monster ! it is the monster ! [ another woman let us out a wail and the peoplefall back in a group , staring toward the darkness and the approaching ﬁgure . people stand in the shadows watching . don martin joins them , carrying a shotgun . he holds it up . ] don we may need this . steve a shotgun ? [ he pulls it out of don 's hand . ] good lord — will anybody think a thought around here ? will you people wise up ? what good would a shotgun do against—— [ now charlie pulls the gun from steve 's hand . ] charlie no more talk , steve . you are going to talk us into a grave ! you would let whatever 's out there walk right over us , would not yuh ? well some of us will not ! [ he swings the gun around to point it toward the sidewalk . the dark ﬁgure continues to walk toward them . the group there , fearful , apprehensive , mothers clutching children , men standing in front of wives . charlie slowly raises the gun . as the ﬁgure gets closer and closer he suddenly pulls the trigger . the sound of it explodes in the stillness . there is a long shot looking down at the figure , who suddenly let us out a small cry , stumblesforward onto his knees and thenfalls forward on his face . don , charlie , and steve raceforward over to him . steve is thereﬁrst and turns the man over . now the crowd gathers around them . ] steve [ slowly looks up . ] it is pete van horn . don [ in a hushed voice . ] pete van horn ! he was just going to go over to the next block to see if the power was on—— woman you killed him , charlie . you shot him dead ! charlie [ looks around at the circle of faces , his eyesfrightened , his face contorted . ] but ... but i did not know who he was . i certainly did not know who he was . he comes walkin ' out of the darkness — how am i supposed to know who he was ? [ he grabs steve ] steve — you know why i shot ! how was i supposed to know he was not a monster or something ? [ he grabs don now . ] we are all scared of the same thing . i was just tryin ' to ... tryin ' to protect my home , that is all ! look , all of you , that is all i was tryin ' to do . [ he looks down wildly at the body . ] i did not know it was somebody we knew ! i did not know— [ there is a sudden hush and then an intake of breath . we see a medium shot of the living room window of charlie 's house . the window is not lit , but suddenly the house lights come on behind it . ] woman [ in a very hushed voice . ] charlie ... charlie ... the lights just went on in your house . why did the lights just go on ? don what about it , charlie ? how come you are the only one with lights now ? goodman that is what I would like to know . [ a pause as they all stare toward charlie . ] goodman you we are so quick to kill , charlie , and you we are so quick to tell us who we had to be careful of . well , maybe you had to kill . maybe peter there was trying to tell us something . maybe he would found out something and came back to tell us who there was amongst us we should watch out for—— [ charlie backs away from the group , his eyes wide with fright . ] charlie no ... no ... it is nothing of the sort ! i do not know why the lights are on . i swear i do not . somebody 's pulling a gag or something . [ he bumps against steve who grabs him and whirls him aground . ] steve a gag ? a gag ? charlie , there is a dead man on the sidewalk and you killed him ! does this thing look like a gag to you ?

'' the motives of intelligent beings , though they may at times appear obscure , are simple things compared to the complex workings of the natural universe . therefore i hope that the people of earth will understand and believe when i tell you that our mission upon this planet is simply this — to bring to you the peace and plenty which we ourselves enjoy , which we have in the past brought to other races throughout the galaxy . when your world has no more hunger , no more war , no more needless suffering , that will be our reward ! 74. close shot the machines as they continue a very normal path . 75. full shot the room as the screen goes black . there is again a slow murmur of the voices . the soviet delegate rises . gregori i should like to pose the question - who promoted that circus ? secretary these tests are quite genuine . gregori a circus ! a second—rate farce . if they we are genuine , mr. secretary - why was the debate stifled ? secretary there 'll be time for further debates tomorrow , the next day , and throughout the week . no one is stifling debate . leveque ( french delegate ) i would remind the delegate from the soviet union that everything the kanamit has promised — has not only worked , but worked beyond our most hopeful expectations . the force field — that was tested yesterday morning . a firecracker couldn ‘ t get through . and we suddenly find ourselves in that strange millennium when none of us need fear a hydrogen bomb or a leveque { cont 'd } missile . we are on the threshold of peace , mr. gregori . on the threshold of peace as we have never known it . there is a murmur of affirmative response and the disgruntled soviet delegate , white—faced , turns and stalks out of the room . dissolve to : 76. a shot of kanamit tilt and filling the screen gesturing , beckoning , handing out papers , small black boxes , bottles of pills . a very stylized concept of giving with many hands receiving . supered over this are newspaper headlines . they read as follows : `` fertility of arable land increased by one hundred percent , '' `` famine thing of the past , '' “ heart disease and cancer cure assured by kanamit injection , '' `` no more war , promises kanamit , as tests prove effectiveness of 'force field .

( he points to the shrouded machines ) this is not what you would call a beehive of activity . 79. different angle pat as she smiles and walks into the room , sitting down in a chair near him . pat this is the new story of man ! nobody needs to decipher much of anything any more because there am not any more codes simply because there am not any more secret messages . ( more ) pat ( cont 'd ) ( she looks away , her voice a little reflective ) odd . ( then looking toward him ) i mean , not reading about hydrogen bombs or war scares or insurrections or anything like that anymore . there is a rumor going around that they are going to disband the united nations inside of a month . chambers millennium . pat or close to it . ( she rises , walks over to the newspaper where we see the kanamits ' name in big black letters repeated over and over again along with his picture ) how many of them are here now ? anybody ever figured it out ? chambers a few thousand , i guess . they have got embassies in every country now . and for every one that comes - a thousand of us take off in their ships to visit them . ( he shakes his head ) that is the odd thing . the fantastic ease with which human beings make adjustments . one day they watch with bated breath while a single person orbits around the world in a rinky— dink cubicle and they think of this as the most historic moment in the history of mankind . one year later they stand in line waiting to get into a space ship to take them a hundred million miles away in space and they act and react as if it we are a weekend picnic in the country . ( he makes a gesture with his hands ) the strange and complex sanity of man . nothing fazes them . pat are you going ? chambers I am on one of the ten—year exchange group waiting lists . what about you , pattie ? pat I am on the list , too . the trouble is their quota 's filled twenty—four hours after they make the announcement of a new trip . but while I am waiting i think I will do the next best thing . I am studying their language . i remember a professor of mine told me that language reflects the basis assumptions of the people who use it . ( she lights a cigarette ) I have got a fair command of their spoken lingo already . it ‘ s not hard , really . and there are hints in it . some of the idioms are quite similar to english . i think I will get the answer eventually . chambers more power ! i gave up a month ago . they write in ideographs worse than chinese , but if i can help you in any way- 80. close shot pat as she moves away , a strange look on her face . 81. two shot chambers ( cont ‘ d ) did i say something- pat ( shakes her head ) if you could help me — that was the phrase , was not it ? chambers nods . pat ( cont 'd ) the only thing you can help me with is— she looks off . chambers is what ? 82. different two shot as the girl faces him . 83 . 84. ll . pat help me get rid of this strange little know inside me . this very funny persistent nightmarish feeling . chambers nightmarish ? pat that is right . a little sixth sense , if you will . chambers that tells you what ? extremely tight close shot pat as she looks up at him . pat that tells me that maybe we should have looked this gift horse in the mouthi dissolve to : int . huge hangar with a long line of people , each carrying similar small handbags . there is a festive air even in the somewhat dark , cavernous aspect of the room . several signs point with arrows and read : `` loading platform this way .

I will have plenty of time to read letters . I am going up there for a rest more than anything . 99. different angle of him as he starts toward the door again , leaving her standing there . he turns close to the door . in lu . the frame we see the space—ship boarding ladder , the last of the passengers are disappearing into the ship . 100. long shot looking back toward pat pat ( her lips quivering , tears in her eyes ) not so much time as you think . mr. chambers ... the rest of the book ... zoomar into an extremely tight close shot of her . pat ( cont ‘ d ) to serve man ... it ‘ s a cook book ! 101. long shot chambers as for a moment he looks stunned . zoomar into extremely tight close shot his face as the horror takes hold . slowly a huge hand comes into the frame to touch chambers 's cheek , pinch it lightly as if feeling for tenderness , then the hand gently , but very firmly turns chambers around and propels up the stairs and they very slowly close up . during the process of this closing , we hear serling 's voice in narration . serling ‘ s voice the very explicit and very specific differences in points of view . to the wee ones ... the little folk called man ... it ‘ s a marvelous adventure , a voyage to another planet . an exciting sojourn to another section of the galaxy . but to the very large , granite— faced inhabitants known as kanamits ... it is nothing more than a cattle car , a very comfortable provisions ship bringing food from the other end of the universe . like i say ... it is all in the point of view . fade to black .

'' 97. close shot martin as he reacts . just the briefest moment of thought , then he puts the car into low gear . 98. long angle shot looking down as the car slowly starts onto the highway . over the disappearing car we hear the narrator ‘ s voice . narrator 's voice martin sloan , age thirty—six . vice president in charge of media . successful in most things -- but not in the one effort that all men try at some time in their lives —— trying to go home again . ( a pause ) and also like all men perhaps there 'll be an occasion ... maybe a summer night some time ... when he will look up from what he is doing and listen to the distant music of a calliope —— and hear the voices and the laughter of the people and the places of his past . and perhaps across his mind there 'll flit a little errant wish ... that a man might not have to become old —— never outgrow the parks and the merry-go—rounds of his youth . ( continued ) 27. continued : ( 15 ) ( a pause ) and he will smile then too because he will know it is just an errant wish . some wisp of memory not too important really . some laughing ghosts that cross a man ‘ s mind ... that are a part of the twilight zone . now the camera pans back down the road to the sign that reads `` homewood -- 1 1/2 miles .

14|Twilight Zone|Where is Everybody|October 2, 1959|1 : `` where is everybody ? '' written by rod serling act one standard road opening shot of the sky ... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp , sparkling relief . as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens -- narrator 's voice there is a sixth dimension beyond that which is known to man . it is a dimension as vast as space , and as timeless as infinity . it is the middle ground between light and shadow -between man 's grasp and his reach ; between science and superstition ; between the pit of his fears and the sunlight of his knowledge . this is the dimension of imagination . it is an area that might be called the twilight zone . the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot ( each week the opening shot of the play ) . we are now looking down the small two-lane asphalt highway . it is dawn , the road is deserted save for a small diner on the left hand side . a broken neon light flashes on and off over the front door . from inside the sound of a rock- ' n'-roll record lends a strange , raucous dissonance to the early morning silence . then the camera sweeps right for a long shot mike ferris who suddenly appears , walking down the road . his step is tentative , unsure . he is a tall man in his thirties . his dress is nondescript , his only identifiable garment being army pants . there is an indecisiveness , a puzzlement , in his features as he comes closer to the camera , sees the diner , stops , rubs his knuckles over the side of his face and feels his beard 's stubble . he pats in his pocket , unsure , reaches in and pulls out a couple of dollar bills . for some reason this buoys him up . he looks a little more resolved as he walks up the steps and into the diner . narrator 's voice we are looking at a male caucasian , age approximately thirty-one , height approximately 5'11 '' . as to his name , where he is , and what he is doing there -- this even he does not know . for the journey that this man will take is an excursion into the shadows , and all of you are invited to go along . dissolve to : opening billboard int . diner it is a small , nondescript , typical eatery with a row of small booths along the outside window , a counter , and a kitchen beyond . the room is empty . pan shot mike as he walks over to a stool and sits down at the counter , reaches over , takes a menu , studies it for a moment , then turns and looks over toward the juke box . med . close shot jukebox garish , multicolored , still blaring out the music . med . shot room he turns on his stool to look toward the opening to the kitchen . close shot an oven inside kitchen through the glass we can see a row of six or seven pies baking and almost fully browned . med . shot room mike calls out . mike ( sardonically calling out ) is this thing loud enough for you out here ? i mean , can you hear it all right ? he grins wryly , waits momentarily for an answer that never comes , turns and looks again at the juke box . he rises , gets off his stool , goes over the juke box , looks all around it , pushes it away from the wall a few inches , reaches back , fiddles with a knob . the music goes much lower . then , satisfied , he pushes the machine back against the wall and goes back over to the counter . mike kind of early for that kind of music , is not it ? still , silence . mike i noticed there is a town just up the road . what is the name of it ? again , silence . mike puts the menu down , peers through the little opening to the kitchen . int . kitchen a small room with a couple of stoves , et cetera . he goes over to the stove , turns down the oven , and looks around the room . he goes over to a back door , tries it and it swings open . he steps back as it creaks open and reveals the diner 's backyard . mike ( calls out ) hey ? you got a customer out front ! hey ! customer here ! still no answer . mike turns , retraces his steps to the lunch counter . med . shot room mike still shows no real emotion beyond a puzzlement . he is neither frightened nor concerned as yet . again he picks up the menu and studies it . he talks out loud , now . mike i think ham and eggs . eggs up and soft . hash browns . coffee . black . ( looks up , calls out again ) customer ! got a customer out front ! ( he rises from the stool again -- sticks his head in the kitchen ) ham and eggs . hash browns . coffee black . he stands there by the open , swinging door staring into the empty kitchen . his eyes dart about now and for the first time we see something beyond puzzlement on his features . what supplants it is irritation , not acute , but definitely there . he reaches into his shirt pocket and takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes , goes back to the lunch counter . now he scratches his head , sits down on the stool for a long moment . suddenly the music on the juke box stops . the sudden cessation of noise brings with it a silence even more obvious . mike turns to stare at the juke box . he looks up at the clock . close shot clock it is on the counter near the coffee urn , its face turned sideways so that mike can not see it . med . close shot mike as he goes over to the clock to turn it around and stare at it . close shot clock it reads a quarter to six . med . shot mike mike turns away from it , but in doing so brushes against it and knocks it to the floor . close shot clock on the floor as mike bends over and picks it up . the face of it is broken . he puts it back on the counter , then goes back over to his seat . med . close shot mike his fingers tap a nervous staccato on the counter top . the silence now begins to be oppressive and nerve-racking . suddenly , as if an afterthought , he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the money , looks at it in his hand , then reaches into all his other pockets . he finds nothing . he rubs at his face again . mike speaks aloud but obviously to no one in an attempt to make noise or sound or just to end the stillness . mike cash customer here . hungry cash customer . ( he rubs his face again ) i got two dollars and eighty-five cents . ( he looks at the money very thoughtfully , almost questioningly ) two dollars and eighty-five cents , american money . ( then he stops and looks off in obvious puzzlement ) american money . ( he throws it out into the air as if to reassure himself as to the meaning of the phrase ) sure , american money . he looks at the clock again , and into the opening to the kitchen and the swinging doors , at the silent juke box , and back at the money in his hand . mike well , we got this much settled . I am an american . ( he raises his voice a little now as if to wake someone in the next room ) there is a little question about my identity . let me put it to you this way -I am not sure who i am . ( he holds up the money ) but I have got two dollars and eighty- five cents and I am hungry . ( more ) mike ( cont 'd ) this much is established ! he gets up off the stool and suddenly slams both palms down hard on the counter , making all the salt shakers and catsup bottles quiver and rattle . mike ( shouts ) i got two dollars and eighty-five cents and I am hungry ! he stops dead now , listening to the silence that enfolds and surrounds him . then he looks around . again the sense of irritation . he takes a drag on his cigarette , then butts it out , rises , goes to the front door and stares out . ext . lunch room the long road that leads away from the lunch counter without a sign of traffic , people , or anything . he whirls around to look back into the lunchroom . mike ( aloud ) I am going to wake up in a minute . i know I am going to wake up . i wish ... i wish there would be a noise or something to wake me up . he suddenly sticks two fingers in his mouth and whistles , listens for a moment , then he whistles again , kind of grinning to himself . mike a little noise , please ! ( now he sings at the top of his voice ) `` yes sir , that is my baby . no sir , do not mean maybe . yes sir , that is my baby now ! '' he laughs a little sheepishly , listens for a moment to the silence , then he turns and goes back to the lunch counter . int . lunch room mike sits down , buries his face in his hands , rubbing his eyes , massaging his temples as if trying to force out with his fingers some connective link ... some reassurance of existence ... some knowledge of where he is and what he is doing . once again he looks around the room . pan shot with his eyes taking in the shots of the coffee urn , the menus , the salt and pepper shakers , all the simple , commonplace , terribly normal adjuncts to what should be a normal scene but somehow is not . he rises now , looks around again , then walks to the door . close shot the 'open ' sign on the door close shot mike as he slowly reaches down and turns the sign over to read closed . then he walks out . dissolve to : ext . town street mike 's p.o.v . it is still early morning , and what we are looking at is the main drag of a small town , flanked by stores , a courthouse , a post office , et al . the most singularly overwhelming feature of this is the complete absence of motion and all noise . long shot mike ferris as he walks down the sidewalk looking from one side of the street to the other . track shot past stores as mike goes by them . drugstore , grocery , soda bar . most of the doors are open and there are lights on inside , but there are no people . there is an odd , indefinable feeling that permeates the scene , a sense of activity and yet coming with no players , and no people , as if it was a place full of motion and movement suddenly stripped of the people performing it . long shot down the street from mike 's point of view . it is devoid of any kind of movement whatsoever . it is absolutely quiet . over this tableau we superimpose the title , `` where is everybody ? '' along with major credits . close shot mike as he stops and looks around . he is suddenly startled by the sound of chimes . he whirls around and looks up . long shot church steeple bell as it rings . close shot mike he shades his eyes to search out the church and then , in turning away from it , he stops abruptly , staring at something across the street . long shot across the street a little clothing store and alongside of it an alley where a large delivery truck is parked . in the cab , in the passenger- seat , a human figure can be seen . long angle shot looking down as mike goes to the curb , cranes his neck to look over to the truck . mike hey , miss ? miss ? ( he makes a gesture that is part a wave , part an attempt at reassurance ) over here , miss . look , i wonder if you could do me a favor ? i do not want you to think I am nuts or anything . i mean , it is nothing like that . it is just that - ( again he grins a little ) i do not seem to remember who i am . it is the craziest thing . I have looked all around and i have not seen anybody around . i guess it is just early or something . literally there has not been a soul . ( he takes a step off the curb , looks again toward the ( more ) ( cont 'd ) cab of the truck , a little puzzled . he smiles again . ) you know , it is a real oddball thing but ... well , i woke up this morning ... ( he stops and rubs his jaw ) i did not exactly wake up . i just sort of found myself on the road walking . ( and then suddenly ) amnesia , that is what they call it , is not it ? amnesia ? well that must be what I have got . i just do not remember a thing ... i can not find anybody to ask ... tracking shot as he starts to walk across the street . mike ( as he walks ) you are the first person I have seen . look , i really do not want you to be frightened or anything , but i was wondering if you could just tell me if maybe there is a doctor or something . close shot mike as he stops dead in his tracks . he is about ten feet from the truck . med . long shot the truck the female figure is outlined in the passenger seat but very much in the shadows . moving shot mike as he gets close to the cab . close shot profile female head flash close shot mike 's eyes as they suddenly narrow in reaction . close shot mike 's hands on the door handle as he suddenly yanks the door open . med . close shot inside the cab the female figure suddenly slumps down in the seat , her head sticking out of the open door , the hair cascading down . the camera pans slowly across her body until it stops at what should be arms . there are no arms . mike reaches over , grabs at the hair of the figure and pulls it up and around , to stare into the wooden face of a mannequin . he very slowly let us loose and the mannequin tumbles back onto the seat and then down to the floor of the cab . close shot floor he mannequin staring up with glassy , manufactured eyes . med . shot mike as he slowly backs away , then turns to read the lettering printed on the side of the truck . close shot lettering it reads , resnick 's store mannequins . close shot mike as his lips form the words that he is read . then he turns to look through the window of the cab at the figure of the mannequin , he takes a few steps over to her and then very gently picks her up and sets her back on the seat . mike I am very sorry , madame . i can assure you that at no time did i mean to be so upsetting . as a matter of fact I have always had a kind of secret yen for quiet women . ( then he grins ) you get what i mean , babe ? ( he kisses his fingertips and then plants them on the mannequin 's nose ) now do not take any wooden boy friends . then he looks at her again for a more pensive moment as if unspoken now we are his earnest wish that this creature was alive and could be talked to . he turns away and walks back across the street . long shot mike as he walks . series of shots mike walking in different sections and on different streets . the last scene ends with him stopping abruptly to stare at something down the street . long shot gas station out in front is a glass-enclosed public phone booth . long angle shot looking down at mike as he walks toward the gas station and goes into the phone booth . mike look , i wonder if anyone there could tell me -he stops abruptly , grins , shakes his head , slaps at the side of his head with an open palm , fishes in his pocket and takes out a coin , deposits it in the phone , then dials the operator . he listens to the dial tone that comes on and off with dull regularity . he jiggles the receiver impatiently . mike operator . operator . will you listen to me ? he pounds on the phone and then just indiscriminately dials a bunch of numbers . he is about to throw down the phone in disgust when suddenly at the other end of the line he hears a dial tone ringing . he very slowly and very gratefully picks up the phone now and hears a voice filtered at the other end . voice ( filtered ) this is the special operator . ( more ) voice ( cont 'd ) the number you have reached is not a working number . please make sure you have the right number and are dialing it correctly . mike starts to shout into the phone . mike is everybody asleep over there ? what kind of operation do you people run ? then she repeats all she is just said as mike listens to her , excited beyond words that he has found someone alive . when she finishes repeating the message he grabs the phone and is about to speak when suddenly he hears the operator 's voice again . voice this is a recording . there is a certain suggestion of tenseness that suddenly shows on mike 's face . voice ( filtered ) this is the special operator . the number you have reached is not a working number . please make sure you have the right number and are dialing it correctly . mike a recording ? ( he pounds on the receiver hook and shouts ) operator ! look , all i want to know is where i am . i just want to know the name of this place . then he slowly let us the receiver loose and it hangs down from the phone box . mike 's hand touches and then grasps a telephone book , a thin one that he grabs and looks at hungrily . close shot telephone cover on it is written oakwood . med . shot mike he rips open the cover , looks down at the first page . mike a. abel . ackerman . adams . allenby . arnold . all right , boys , where are you ? ( his voice is a little edgier now ) where do you all live ? just in this book here ? ( he rips the page open ) baker . beldon . biltmore . botsford . well , look , gang -- who is watching the store ? he suddenly turns to look out at the street . full shot the street mike 's p.o.v . med . close shot mike mike who is watching any of the stores ? he let us loose of the phone book now , let us it fall to the floor , and stands there motionless for a moment , deep in thought . then he automatically reaches for the door handle , turns it , and pushes . nothing happens . he tries again and it remains locked . he waits a moment , then puts all his weight against it . it does not yield . it is more than irritation that we see on mike 's face now . there is the first suggestion of a real concern . he looks around his strange , glass prison . mike all right . who is the wise guy ? who locked the door ? ( he tries the door once again ) it is a great gag . he pounds again and then suddenly stops and looks all around . pan shot from mike 's p.o.v . from inside the phone booth . the camera moves all the way around the glass , almost in a three hundred and sixtydegree pan . med . close shot mike he laughs softly , shakes his head . mike trapped in a phone booth ! trapped in a glass phone booth , like a goldfish . ( then he suddenly calls out ) well , here i am ! you got me ! everybody come see ! I am right here on display ! long angle shot looking down at mike in the phone booth , as once again he starts to pound on the glass . mike how about a hand , somebody ? a little assistance -- how about it ? this is an absolutely hysterical town , and I am growing very fond of it , but I would appreciate it if -he stops abruptly . close shot mike 's face as he stares at something through the glass . close shot a cigar half-smoked and still burning , lying on the sidewalk just outside the booth . angle shot looking into mike 's face through the glass . for the very first time there is a look of incipient fear . mike look . whoever 's out there . this is not funny any more . you understand ? i do not like this jazz . it is getting dull . ( he looks around again ) ( more ) mike ( cont 'd ) look , i know i can be heard . i know ... i know somebody 's watching me . immediately after he is said this he realizes he has suddenly given voice to his fear . he is labeled what is beginning to bother him . simply a sense of being watched . he suddenly bends down , picks up the phone book , flings it against the glass of the door . the glass disintegrates . mike sticks his hand through , opens the door from the outside , then kicks at it with his foot . it springs open and halfway off its hinges as he goes out onto the street . then he looks down at his hand . it is cut ; a rivulet of blood runs down through the fingers . he feels for a handkerchief , takes it and wraps it around the hand . he squeezes it a couple of times , trying to get more blood to flow . then he starts down the street again . long shot street mike 's p.o.v . once again the sense of emptiness and loneliness and that bizarre quality of activity with no actors . track shot with mike as he continues down the street he pauses in front of a building and looks up . close shot sign which reads , police station . track shot he walks up the steps and into the building . int . police station there is a small anteroom , and then an open , barred door which leads to a corridor lined with cells . med . close shot mike as he enters and looks around . there is a police sergeant 's desk , files , pictures of wanted men on the wall . a teletype machine hums in the corner . mike goes to look at it . the light over it is on , but nothing is being written . he whirls around and stares toward the sergeant 's desk , goes behind it , picks up a microphone , fingers it for a moment , then talks into it . mike calling all cars . calling all cars . unknown man walking around the police station . suspicious looking character . probably wanted by the fbi -then he stops , looks at the mike , chuckles softly for a moment and then stops abruptly , the smile gone . he flings the microphone away from him and looks slowly around the room . mike i wish i could shake that feeling ... ( he looks around again ) that crazy feeling of being watched ... listened to ... he stares toward the cell doors then begins to walk slowly toward them . close shot mike as he stands in the middle of the next room , looking from empty cell to empty cell . then he whirls around at a bubbling sound . there , on a hot plate , is a pot of coffee perking . behind him we see the barred door leading to the anteroom begin to close . mike 's eyes look wild , as if subconsciously he realizes he is in danger . he whirls around to see the cell door closing and then , with a shout , throws himself against it , pushing it away before it locks . he seems to hang on it now , breathing deeply . mike all right , time to wake up ! time to wake up now ! he whirls around , his face distorted , close up against the camera . he shouts . mike time to wake up ! he stumbles through the anteroom and then back to the street . ext . street long angle shot looking down at mike as he stands in the middle of the empty street , the stores around him , the quiet . he suddenly screams . mike where is everybody ? where is everybody ! ? fade to black : end act one act two fade on : film clip a hot and high afternoon sun shimmering in a sea of heatwaves . the camera sweeps down until it is level with the street and a long shot mike ferris as he sits on a curb , staring dully and numbly across at nothing . the church steeple clock sounds two . he looks up , listens to it , but is no longer shocked by it . he just let us the sound of the chimes play along the edges of his consciousness without really being aware of them . now he rises and walks slowly , methodically , without much apparent purpose across the street . he looks up to see a sign reading drugstore . he enters . int . drugstore it is light and cheerful inside . on the left hand side is the soda bar with a big mirror behind it full of stickers advertising various concoctions -- soft drinks , ice cream , sandwiches . mike , as he enters , pauses by the cigarette and candy counter . he looks through the glass for a long moment , then reaches behind and takes out a couple of cigars . he unwraps one , sticks it in his mouth , lights it , takes a couple of draws , butts it out , reaches in another box , takes one of those , then looks in the box . mike two for a dollar . now that is more like it . i always like an expensive cigar . then he turns with a smile and says to nobody . mike how about you guys -- any of you want a cigar ? series of shots of empty booths med . close shot mike as he gets up on a stool . mike I will take a chocolate soda with chocolate ice cream . he starts to laugh , but the laugh is checked almost immediately as he sees his reflection in the mirror the counter . his fingers run exploringly across his taking in the beard stubble , the hollowness beneath eyes , the strange , haunted , frightened look that is there . he looks at himself again for a long moment . behind face , the obvious mike you will forgive me , old pal , but i do not recollect the name . the face seems vaguely familiar ... but it is the name that escapes me . ( a pause ) I will tell you what my problem is . I am in the middle of a nightmare that i can not wake up from . ( he points to the reflection ) you are part of it . you and the ice cream and the cigar . that police station and the phone booth . that little mannequin . this whole bloody town , wherever it is . ( a pause ) whatever it is . i just remembered something . scrooge said it . you remember scrooge , old buddy ? ebenezer scrooge ? it is what he said to the ghost , jacob marley . he said , `` you may be an undigested bit of beef , a blot of mustard , a crumb of cheese , a fragment of an undone potato . there is more of gravy than of grave about you . '' you see ? that is what you all are . you are what i had for dinner last night . you must be . but now I would like to wake up . I have had it ... I would like to wake up now . and if i can not wake up , at least I would like ... I would like to find somebody to talk to . he rises now and goes behind the counter . he starts to fix himself a chocolate soda , experimenting with some of the cupboards until he finds the right ingredients , the ice cream , the milk , et cetera . then he mixes himself a soda , tall , frosty , delicious . he starts to sip it with a straw as he walks around the drugstore . he stops by a poster of a high school football schedule . close shot cardboard sign it reads , oakwood high school , 1958 schedule . a list of teams and dates to be played appears below . med . close shot mike as he takes it in one hand and reads it as he sips the soda . but the normality of it suddenly points out the incongruity of what he is living through . he puts the poster back on the counter , shaking his head , staring at it . mike i must be a very imaginative guy . very imaginative . nobody in the whole world can have a dream as ... as complete as mine . right down to the last detail . ( he taps the poster ) right down to the last detail . he turns , stares across at a big magazine rack near the front window of the store . he crosses over to it , stares down at some of the magazines , then kneels down , interested . he begins to trace the dates on each one of the magazines . the majority of them say october 1958 and his mouth forms that phrase , `` october 1958 . '' then he bites his lips , shakes his head again , rises , looks down at the group of comic books , each with a lurid title having to do with horror themes , spook themes , et cetera . then suddenly he stops and looks down at one , the cover of which is peeping out from behind the others and whose title is visible . he reaches down and pulls it out just a few inches farther so that he can read the entire title . tight close shot cover the title : the last man on earth . med . shot mike he picks it up and stares at the cover , then flings it down on the floor . he turns rapidly away and heads back to the counter where he puts the soda down . he is suddenly gripped by another spasm of such utter loneliness that it forces him out onto the street . ext . street camera follows him out of the store . as he gets out on the street he suddenly shouts , shrilly , illogically . mike ( shouting ) hey ! hey , anybody ! anybody hear me ? anybody hear me ? he almost lurches to the other side of the street where he buries his face against the window of a building . when his head goes back he sees the letters you.s . post office and he starts to laugh again . mike any mail for me ? anybody write me a letter ? i do not know what my name is , but maybe you can tell me in there , huh ? will you tell me what my name is ? he pounds his fist against the glass to stifle what obviously is a sob as to the loneliness and to the unknown gnawing fear that envelops him . then window , struggling for composure . and then suddenly has he begins to give in and to the pulsating , he turns away from the close shot mike he looks at something across the street . camera sweeps wide until it stops on -long shot building with a sign reading city bank . long shot mike as he gets up off the bench , walks across the street , and into the bank . int . bank track shot mike as he walks past all the tellers ' cages . he stops at the end of the line , presses his face against the bars . close shot row after row of stacked bills med . shot mike mike I would like to borrow about eight hundred thousand dollars . how about it ? ( then he nods and grins ) thanks . i think that is generous of you . i think that is really generous . he pulls the bars up , reaches in and takes two packages of money . then he starts to retrace his steps toward the front door . he is about to leave when he looks toward the first teller 's window . med . shot rows of coins on top of the counter med . shot mike he takes some of the bills that he is crammed into his shirt pocket , throws them away . mike got ta make room for some silver . he goes behind the teller 's window and starts to cram rolls of coins into his pockets . then suddenly his eyes look wild again as he looks up , his eyes scanning the room . and again , illogically , the same mixture of wisdom and paranoia . mike somebody watching me ? he goes out in front of the teller 's cage again and looks around . mike somebody watching me ? he looks up toward the ceiling and around as if expecting to see someone . mike crazy feeling . crazy , odd-ball feeling . like ... like i knew someone was watching me . and then his eyes narrow again in an awareness of danger . mike watching me ... and trying to button me up someplace . trying to trap me . he looks around wildly again . close shot his legs as he starts to run toward the door . he trips over some sort of a lever close to the teller 's cage . flash shot alarm bell on the wall as it begins to ring . long angle shot looking down at mike as he stops by the front door and whirls around as the loud , dissonant clanging pierces the quiet . then he whirls around and tries the front door again . it is locked . series of flash shots bell . teller 's cage . locked door . mike 's hand . mike 's face . track shot mike as he races toward the alarm on the wall . he grabs the wires that extend from it and suddenly yanks on them , pulling them apart . the bell abruptly stops . then he whirls around and stares at the front door . close shot door it is now ajar . med . shot mike as he goes back toward the teller 's cage , grabs the coins and bills , crams them back into his pocket . he walks toward the open door , then out onto the street again , leaving a trail of silver and bills behind him . he sits down on the curb , unwraps the handkerchief from around his hand , wipes his face with it . he reaches into his pocket , takes out a crumpled fistful of bills , takes one out , grins at it , takes out the remnants of a cigar , sticks the cigar in his mouth , takes the bill , lights it . mike here 's something I have always wanted to do . always wanted to do this . he takes the lit bill and lights a cigar with it , then he let us loose of the burning bill and watches it flutter to the ground and disappear in ashes . mike watches it burn , and then slowly his face looks tired , hopeless . mike big deal . so what ? big deal . he let us his head hang a moment . dissolve to : ext . town square [ night ] tight close shot street lamp as it suddenly goes on . camera then pans down for a shot of mike on a bench looking up toward the light . then he turns to look toward the street flanking the square . the lights have gone on in front of all the stores and in the windows . close shot mike reacting . med . long shot theater marquee as the lights go on around it . track shot mike he walks across the street , stops by the ticket window , and then , almost dreamlike , speaks . mike I would like one tick -then he stops , shakes his head , closes his eyes , realizing how ludicrous this is . he is about to go in when he suddenly stops and stares at a poster advertising the movie . close shot poster which shows an air force pilot in his coveralls advertising the movie . med . close shot mike as he suddenly feels his own outfit and gradually makes the connection that the uniform of the man in the picture is similar to that which he wears . mike air force . air force . ( then he whirls around , looks up toward the sky ) air force . I am air force . ( he once again looks down at his coveralls and feels them , grabs at them ) air force . I am in the air force . track shot mike as he walks from the outside of the theater , through the lobby , on into the interior . mike ( shouting ) hey , everybody . I am in the air force . i remember that much . I am in the air force . does anybody hear me ? I am in the air force . and then once again he rubs his eyes , runs a hand wildly across his face and then suddenly surveys the theater . cut to : full shot the theater there are enough lights on to cast a soft orange glow through the room . he looks around at the absolute , vast emptiness of the place . then he sits down , checks his watch , looks up at the big white screen with nothing on it . he looks at his watch again and then settles down in the chair , his eyes closed , and he starts to succumb to the fatigue that sweeps over him . mike air force . what does that mean ? was there a bomb or something ? is that what happened ? that must have been it , a bomb . but if there was a bomb - ( he looks around the empty theater now ) it would have destroyed everything . and nothing is destroyed . suddenly he is aware of the lights lowering . he starts and his eyes open wide in time to see the last of the lights go down . a long beam of white light shines from the projection booth and suddenly on the screen appears a big introductory title , cartoon parade , with appropriate march music . mike leaps to his feet , looks from the projection booth down to the screen . he suddenly starts to run down the aisle , shouting . mike hey ! hey , somebody up there ? he stops in front of the projectionist 's light so that we get an almost -- nightmarish picture of the cartoons partially showing on his face and body as he screams . mike hey , somebody up there ? who is running the pictures ? can you see me ? can you see me up there ? hey ! then he races back up the aisle , arriving at the rear of the theater . he looks wildly around , then he sees a door with a glass window , steps visible on the other side . long angle shot stairs as he races up them . int . projection booth as he bursts inside . the picture is running from one of the two projectors , but the room is absolutely empty . mike races over to the machine , bends down and peers at it as the film goes through and he hears the sound of the cartoon music and voices . this is too much for him . he throws himself against the wall , peering out of the small , circular hole that the picture shoots through . long angle shot through the hole of the vast , empty theater . int . projection booth he turns away , goes out the door , stumbling down the steps . angle shot down stairs he continues down the steps and out into the lobby again . int . lobby he stops for a moment and looks across the lobby . med . long shot popcorn machine that is at this moment making popcorn . close shot mike as he closes his eyes , shakes his head . then he opens them . his eyes go wide . he starts to run toward the camera , coming up very close and almost at the point of impact we cut away to : tight two shot of mike and a mirror as he smashes his face and hands against it and then recoils from the reflection , backs off a few feet , and then looks at the mirror on the opposite side of the room . the combination throws off reflections almost to infinity . he looks from left to right staring at the hundreds of mike ferrises who ape him in his every movement . then he stops and looks across at the refreshment stand where the popcorn continues to pop in the big container . this , too , is more than he can stand . his face screws up like a small child about to cry , and then he shouts . mike oh my god . oh my dear god ! he stumbles through the lobby and out into the street . ext . street he stumbles down the street aimlessly now , intent only on moving , not finding . his footsteps start to drag and finally he stops , sits down on the curb , buries his face in his hands , rubs his eyes . then he looks up to once again find himself looking through the drugstore window , the magazine that he had been reading lies on the floor face up . high angle shot looking down through the window , distorting the cover of the magazine in such a manner as to make the lettering appear big and irregular . once again the title slaps at him across the face . the last man on earth . he rises slowly , backing away from the window , shaking his head . he turns and races across the street . suddenly , then , he stops abruptly as the light on the corner changes to red and he instinctively comes to a halt . and then he stops dead , realizing once again the ludicrousness of it . he begins to laugh -- the laughter becomes convulsive , wild . all the way across the street he continues it . track shot as he goes by all the stores that we have been introduced to . as he goes by each one a sound emanates from it , a sound way out of proportion to what it actually should be . when he passes the pool hall we hear the mammoth bowling alley sound echoing from it . from in front of the theater comes a cacophony of music and laughter . from the drug store there is a fizzling , bubbling sound of drinks . from the record store , the dissonant , blaring sound of music . as each noise joins in it becomes mumbled and part of a big morass of noise . gradually the very dimension of it so frightens and shocks mike that he begins to back away from each store as he passes -- it as if being assaulted on all sides . he stumbles against a street post , whirls around , frightened , stares at it , and then suddenly , almost supplicatingly , throws his arms around it , buries his face against it . he starts to sob . mike will not somebody help me ? will not somebody please help me ? then his sobs subside and he stands there , breathing deeply . his eyes slowly open . sweat stands out on his features . he looks haggard , desperate , close to cracking . the noise somehow , for no apparent reason , suddenly stops and there is a deep , dead , all-pervading silence again . mike 's eyes travel up the post , stare up toward the sky . he squints against the sun . mike who is watching me ? who is looking at me ? ( screaming ) who is looking at me ? he looks down toward the street . long shot the street he moves to the middle of the road again , still looking up toward the sky , and then as if suddenly seeing an adversary , begins to run . close shot store window as mike backs into it , trying to get inside , reaching for the door and missing , and then slamming his face against the front pane . close shot mike 's face and eyes looking from inside the store outside toward him . his eyes go wide and he starts to scream . close shot over mike 's shoulder at a huge eye looking at him . med . shot mike as he starts to run away from the store again . the camera takes in a shot of an optometrist 's sign with a huge eye that mike had seen . track shot mike as he runs back toward the post . he grabs it and holds on tight , then he looks down . his hands have touched a button and he looks down at it . tight close shot a button with a sign over it : push to turn green . med . shot mike as he looks away toward the light . close shot the light med . shot and then suddenly mike slams the palm of his hand against the button and punches it over and over again . mike somebody help me . help me . help me . close shot the light as if flashes from red to green , from green to red , from red to green , over and over again . close shot mike 's hand as he keeps pushing the button . his voice , sobbing , screeching , plaintive , frightened . mike somebody help me . please . please , help me -dissolve to : out of focus on his hand close shot in focus his hand pushing a button on an instrument panel . the camera dollies away until both the back of the panel and mike 's face are on a small television screen . long angle shot down a line of officers in a viewing room as they intently watch the screen . we hear mike 's voice as it coincides with a red light that flashes brilliantly on and off over the viewing screen . mike 's voice please . please help me . help me . a general , obviously in command , turns to his aide on his right . general clock him ! ( and then turning to his left says to the officer alongside ) get him out of there , quick ! officer two reaches over for a hand mike . pushes the button . officer two release the subject ! on the double ! int . large hangarlike room in the center of it , illuminated by a couple of spots in an otherwise dark room , is a small , hermetically sealed metal box about six by five feet and about five feet high . a sliding panel is pushed back . several air force men reach down and start unstrapping mike and then carefully lift him through the hole . a white-clad medical officer begins to remove electrodes that have been taped to his body at various points . by this time mike has stopped speaking . his eyes are half closed . he breathes deeply and irregularly , slumps forward in his seat . close shot his right fist smashed against the instrument panel . extremely tight close up his fist and the broken glass covering a clock on the panel which reads six fifteen . med . group shot the air force men as they remove him . air force man one be careful . he is cut his hand on that clock glass there -long shot general and staff as they hurriedly approach the scene , their footsteps ringing hollowly on the concrete floor . medical officer he is all right , sir . delusions of some sort . i guess that is it . he is coming out of it now . general ( nods ) fine . you get all your data recorded ? medical officer yes , sir . every bit of it . general ( to officer one who comes up from behind ) did you get him clocked ? officer one yes , sir . four hundred and eighty four hours , thirty-six minutes . general good . I would like to get a look at all the data when they are compiled . I would like the reaction chart on him , too . officer two ( sotto ) the press , sir ? he points toward the opposite side of the room . long shot three or four members of the press as they stand waiting expectantly . group shot general and the others general on the run , if they do not mind . i want to talk to ferris . officer two yes , sir . he motions toward the press , and beckons them over as the general , the medical officers , and the others start walking in the opposite direction toward mike ferris , who lies on a stretcher at the very far and opposite side of the room . track shot with the general and the reporters as they join him and start to walk across the room toward ferris . reporter one you consider it a success , sir ? general very much so . he is been alone in that box for something in the neighborhood of four hundred and eighty four hours , which is roughly equivalent to a trip to the moon , several orbits , and then back . reporter one and this then was a simulated trip to the moon ? is that right , general ? general ( nods ) for all intent and purpose . reporter two what about the wires attached to him ? general electrodes . all of his reactions have been charted and graphed . respiration , heart action , blood pressure . at this moment they reach a point some ten feet away from where mike ferris lies on a stretcher attended by a couple of medics . their voices become low . reporter three what happened to him toward the end ? just before he pushed that button or whatever it is . general what happened to him was that he cracked . we assume delusions of some sort , but I will tell you something , gentlemen -- you spend two and a half weeks all by your lonesome in a five foot square box without ever being able to hear a human voice other than your own ... I will give you especially good odds that your imagination would run away with you too , just as his obviously did . one of the medics looks up , motions the general over . the general takes a few steps until he is very close to mike . general how do you feel , son ? mike ( his voice is weak but he is obviously much improved now ) i feel much better , sir . I am sorry about ... toward the end . medical officer ( close by ) what was it like , ferris ? where did you think you we are ? mike ( looks from one to the other , wets his lips ) some place i do not want to visit again . a town ... a town without people . without anybody . medical officer and you had to get out of that town , did not you ? mike ( nods ) i sure did . ( then he looks up toward the medical officer ) what was the matter with me ? just off my rocker , huh ? medical officer just a kind of nightmare , ferris , that your mind manufactured for you . the reporters lean forward straining to overhear this conversation . medical officer you see , ferris , we can feed stomachs concentrates . we can supply microfilm recreation , reading , even movies of a we can pump oxygen in , waste material with for sort . out . the camera now moves around so that it is shooting just over the heads of all the men assembled and is looking at the box in the background which is on the periphery of the light . medical officer but there is one thing we can not simulate . that is a pretty basic need -- man 's hunger for companionship , the barrier of loneliness . that is one we have not licked yet . at this moment the medics help ferris to his feet . he stands there motionless for a moment as if testing newfound legs , and then he looks out toward the open hangar door at the night sky . mike next time though ... it will not be just a box and a hangar , will it ? general ( going to his side and looking out toward the sky with him ) no , mike . next time you will really be alone . there is a long , thoughtful silence as mike takes a few steps toward the hangar door . he pauses for a moment near the box . a side has been removed so that he is staring directly into the control panel where the broken clock can be seen still reading six fifteen . close shot mike as he reacts . close shot cockpit as the camera pans over the broken clock , a microphone which hangs by the cord , a small microfilm apparatus , et cetera . med . close shot mike as he looks away and then continues to walk over to the hangar door . he slowly looks up toward the sky and the camera sweeps up for a long shot of the moon hanging bright and lustrous in the sky . mike ( grins thoughtfully , stares up toward the silver orb , and then quietly ) do not go away up there . next time ... next time it will not be a nightmare or a dream . next time it will be real . so do not go away ... we will be there in a little while . then he starts to walk out in the night followed by the others . the camera begins a slow pan back into the room until it is shooting on the box , squatting empty and impassive in the empty room . narrator 's voice the barrier of loneliness . the palpable , desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man . lap dissolve to : night sky the moon and the stars . narrator 's voice up there ... up there is the vastness of space , in the void that is sky ... up there is an enemy known as isolation . it sits there in the stars waiting ... waiting with the patience of eons ... forever waiting ... in the twilight zone . fade to black : the end

I have got to be in boston at nine a.m. driver ( to the businessman ) then you better start walking , mister , 'because that bus stays out there till they fix the bridge . either that , or have 'em drop some snowshoes . trooper perry so , you might as well get comfortable and get a little hot food in ya . businessman oh , that is just great . that is fine , is not it ? get comfortable and get a little hot food in you . that is precious little consolation for missing my meeting in boston . ( rises , laughs , crosses to the driver , and sits at his table ) that is a fine little bus line you work for , is not it ? they care so much about their schedules , do not they ? driver i would not be too hard on 'em , mister . they have no control over the snow , bridges , the sides of hills that decide to come down . that is pretty much out of their hands . the troopers scan the customers again . trooper perry ( quietly , to padgett ) what do you think ? trooper padgett they we are all on that bus , were not they ? counterman ( to the troopers ) what is the trouble ? you looking for somebody ? trooper padgett ( crosses to the driver ) driver , um , have you got a passenger manifest ? driver passenger manifest ? what do you think i got parked out there ? a 707 ? mister , that is a fourteen year old bus and business is lousy . my boss 'd run rum across the border if there was a profit in it . i do not ask passengers their names . we kiss 'em gently and help 'em in . we are that glad to have 'em , with or without names . trooper perry know how many you had ? driver six . unless one of 'em fell out the window when we hit a bump . i picked up six and I am supposed to deliver six . trooper padgett ( glances around ) nobody fell out . ( more ) trooper padgett ( cont 'd ) somebody must have jumped in . there 're seven here now . driver ( rises , silently counts the customers ) that is funny . i know i had six people . padgett crosses to the counter , where the counterman sets down a cup of coffee for him . trooper padgett ( to the counterman ) thanks . now , tell me , was there anybody in here before the bus stopped ? counterman no , i have not served anybody since eleven of the clock this morning . i figured this whole bunch got off the bus . driver we did . there was no one in here when we came in . trooper perry then how do you account for seven people ? driver that one beats me . ( it dawns on him ) one of them did not get off the bus . ( sits back down ) trooper perry which one of you was not on the bus ? businessman ( annoyed ) we we are all on the bus . what kind of interrogation is this , anyway ? if we are going to be grilled , i want to talk to a lawyer . the old man at the counter cackles and turns around , his wild-eyed face visible for the first time . grandpa that is a good one . first , he wants snowshoes , then he wants a lawyer . businessman ( pointedly , to grandpa ) i do not remember seeing you on the bus . grandpa ( to the businessman ) that is quite funny , 'because i do not remember seeing you neither . ( winks at the driver ) makes one of us a liar , do not it ? grandpa and the driver laugh at this . this is it make whether hundred gestapo businessman preposterous . what difference does who was on the bus or who was not or there we are six or seven or a and twenty ? is this a diner or headquarters ? counterman ( to the businessman ) aw , now take it easy , mister . ( to the troopers ) what is it all about ? trooper perry ( to the counterman ) did you hear anything flying over here tonight ? haley flying over here ? no , i did not hear anything . trooper perry we got a call about two hours ago . woman said she heard something fly over and then come down . counterman fly over here ? from where ? trooper padgett from up there . ( rolls his eyes heavenward ) an unidentified flying object . counterman unidentified flying object ? ( chuckles ) nothing 's come down from up there 'cept snow . that is all I have seen for the past fourteen hours , snow . where did she say it came down ? trooper perry close to here . trooper padgett look , something did land in tracy 's pond . left a trail of broken branches before it hit . we found tracks leading away from it . counterman to where ? trooper padgett to here . counterman ( amused ) you mean something landed in tracy 's pond and then came in here ? that is crazy . nothing 's come in here since eleven this morning . nothing , except ... driver except me and my passengers . me and six people . that means that one person here ... now it is the driver 's turn to look heavenward . it is an unsettling thought . young wife ( quietly , to her husband ) george , i do not like this . young husband easy , honey , easy . old husband ( to the troopers ) now , let me get this straight . you are trying to tell us that there is one person in here who landed in some kind of a saucer or something and then came in here ? blonde came in here with us ? padgett nods . businessman well , that is just not possible . we would have seen them . old husband not necessarily . it is snowing and dark . we climbed off of that bus with our eyes closed to get out of the snow . anyone could have come in with us and we would not 've noticed . trooper padgett you we are all on the bus together . you would have known who the other passengers we are . driver well , that do not cut any ice . they loaded in the snow at hook 's landing . tell you the truth , i do not know who got on . grandpa she is just like a science fiction , that is what she is ! a regular ray bradbury ! six humans and one monster from outer space . ( to the businessman ) you would not happen to have an eye in the ( more ) grandpa ( cont 'd ) back of your head , would you ? the driver cracks up . businessman ( to grandpa ) look , i find you offensive , you know that ? grandpa winks at the driver . blonde ( to padgett ) what do you do now , officer ? trooper padgett ( to the blonde ) look , lady , this is not exactly par for our courses either . we go off on a lot of nutty assignments , but this one -- wow ! blonde well , i know how you begin . you pair off the couples . since it is just one person who does not belong here , you ... you eliminate the couples . the older couple smile and nod their heads . old husband ( a little smugly ) we are exonerated . cross us off . we are two of the humans . young husband us , too . my wife and i. we are in the clear . he clutches his wife 's hand with its ringed finger . but his wife looks at him doubtfully . young husband ( to his wife ) what is the matter ? young wife i-i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin . young husband a mole on my chin ? connie , i never had a mole on my chin . old husband ( rises ) i can tell you what is going to happen . we are all going to get so panicky that everyone and his brother will start picking up invisible clues from everybody else . this is nonsense . ( sits ) old wife well , of course , it is nonsense . if a husband and wife suddenly start wondering whether the husband is really the husband and the wife ... is ... really ... now , this wife looks doubtfully at her own husband . old husband ( indignant , to his wife ) now , wait a minute ! i think twenty-three years is long enough for a woman to know who she is married to -- so , I will thank you to stop looking at me as if i just put on this face as part of a costume . not entirely reassured , the old wife puffs on her cigarette nervously . grandpa ( laughs ) i love this . she do not know who he is . he do not know who she is . we do not know who she is . and this lemon-sucker here ( points to the businessman ) -- he is the most suspicious of the bunch . again , the driver can not help but laugh at grandpa . the businessman shakes his head in disgust . trooper perry ( to the counterman ) have you got a back door to this place ? counterman sure . why ? trooper padgett go back there and lock it . counterman well , it is already locked . if that certain somebody really is from outer space , they will just go through the wall anyway . grandpa ( waves his hat , to the troopers ) check 'em for wings ! check 'em for wings ! look under their coats ! the driver busts out laughing again . perry is getting a little fed up with grandpa 's outbursts . trooper perry ( crosses to grandpa ) you got identification , grandpa ? grandpa ( pauses and squints at perry ) left it down in the pond in my spaceship . trooper perry ( to grandpa ) who won the world series race last year ? businessman what is this , a sort of prolonged practical joke ? grandpa ( to all ) i get it ! i get it ! ( to perry ) pittsburgh pirates won it -- took four out ( more ) grandpa ( cont 'd ) of seven from the yankees . ( to all ) sharp boys , real sharp boys ! ( to perry ) did not figure us martians would know nothing ' about the great american pastime , did ya ? huh ? huh ? grandpa cackles . the blonde laughs at him . trooper padgett ( crosses to the blonde ) you got identification , miss ? blonde well , no , as a matter of fact , i do not . i left my wallet -- i left it in my suitcase . it was shipped on ahead . trooper padgett what is your name , miss ? blonde ethel mcconnell . I am a ... professional dancer . grandpa how many legs ? how many legs ? blonde I am going to belt you , grandpa . driver ( grinning , to the troopers , with certainty ) she was on the bus . trooper padgett how do you know ? driver ( looking her over ) she is the only one i noticed . blonde ( smiling , to the driver ) well , thank you . grandpa but who noticed him ? the driver laughs again , but stops -- realizing the joke 's on him . grandpa ( to the driver ) how do we know you are the same one driving the bus ? huh ? ( to all ) have not nobody been exonerated yet , that is for sure ! businessman look , let us cut this farce out right now . we will all show our identifications and put a stop to it . the whole thing 's ridiculous . old husband ( arms folded , to the businessman ) then , how do you explain the extra person in here ? old wife yes , how about that ? businessman very simple . the driver is mistaken . seven people got on the bus and he thought there we are only six . trooper padgett ( crosses to the driver ) is that possible ? driver not a chance in the world . i counted heads before we took off . ( pointedly , to the businessman ) there we are six people . trooper padgett ( crosses to the blonde ) miss ... ? the jukebox suddenly lights up and starts blasting a record . all eyes turn to it . just as suddenly , the music grinds to a halt . the lights in the rest of the diner begin to flicker on and off . padgett puts a hand on his holstered gun , ready for anything . after a moment , things return to normal . but everyone is slightly spooked . counterman what caused that ? perry inspects the jukebox . trooper padgett ( to all ) we , er , we may get a laugh out of all this in the morning . in the meantime , everyone stay right where they are . the blonde , grandpa , and the driver glance nervously overhead . the businessman looks discouraged . the older married couple look around at the others . the younger couple looks at one another . and the counterman can not believe this is happening . fade out end of act one act two fade in on the inside of the diner , later that night , as the counterman emerges from the back , wiping his hand . he sees the driver now seated with the blonde at her table . they seem to be enjoying one another 's company . counterman ( to the driver ) where 're the troopers ? driver hm ? oh , stepped outside . ( peers out the window ) snow stopped . ( to the counterman ) say , haley ... ( points to the jukebox ) that was not your gag , was it ? i mean , the business about the jukebox starting like that . counterman ( puts up his hands , retreats to behind the counter ) not me ! I am strictly short orders and `` pay your taxes '' -- i do not know anything about science fiction . a jukebox is a jukebox and if that thing wants to start up all on its own , you will check with an electrical engineer . grandpa gets a fiendish glint in his eye , rises from his stool at the counter , and approaches the jukebox . abruptly , he straightens up and salutes it . grandpa ( to the jukebox ) take me to your leader ! ( laughs , to all ) take me to your leader ! grandpa calms down a little as the troopers enter the diner . the two married couples , quietly napping at their tables , awaken . padgett sits at the counter across from the counterman . counterman ( to the troopers ) find anything ? trooper perry no . took a look at the bridge . trooper padgett holding up pretty well . driver i know that bridge , and what is more , i do not trust it . businessman ( to the driver ) well , thank goodness we need not concern ourselves with your judgment . if the bridge gets a clean bill of health , you will drive that bus right across it . driver ( to the businessman ) listen , mister . you may be a big shot in boston , but when it comes to bridges and busses , i got seniority . and i tell you , that bridge is so old that at any -the lights go out . everyone looks around nervously . blonde hey , what is this ? ( the lights come back on ) why did the lights go out like that ? counterman we may be losing power . the jukebox starts up again , startling grandpa and trooper perry who stand beside it . counterman this is weird . this is just plain weird . the jukebox dies again . the tension in the room thickens . blonde well , i wish whoever it is would play his cards right now . young wife ( agitated ) why do not they do something ? what is the point of us all staying cooped up in here like this and ... . the young husband comforts her . trooper perry ( to the young wife ) the point is this , miss . we are all kids in a closet here . nobody understands what is going on . if there was some kind of a saucer that landed in that pond , and he did come in here , i think it would be a real healthy idea if we pinpointed that particular somebody and kept him from leaving . counterman makes sense . maybe whoever it is , is invisible . maybe they are just playin ' around . cat and mouse . businessman that is childish nonsense . old husband it is as good an explanation as any I have heard . but what if the ... the thing does not show itself ? do we just sit here holding our breath ? old wife yeah , how 'bout that ? grandpa well , if somebody was to ask me -- businessman ( interrupts , sharply ) well , no one did ask you . no one will . grandpa stops short , mouth open . blonde ( offended , to the businessman ) why do not you leave the old man alone ? businessman who invited you into this ? blonde well , i did not realize we we are waiting for invitations , but you have got this big thing about bossing everybody around . grandpa nods in agreement . old husband look , it is tough enough just sitting here without-abruptly , the lights flicker off and on , off and on , for a long , eerie moment . as soon as the lights come back on , the sugar bowls on the two married couples ' tables suddenly flip over . the wives scream . padgett and perry draw their guns and cover the doors . trooper padgett ( to grandpa ) get over there and sit down , gramps . grandpa sits at the counter . the businessman glances at the diner 's pay phone just as it rings . padgett answers it on the second ring . trooper padgett ( into the phone ) yeah ? ... what is that ? it is okay ? ... all right , thanks . ( hanging up , to all ) the bridge is okay . businessman well . it is about time . shall we go ? the troopers re-holster their guns and confer . trooper padgett what do you think , perry ? trooper perry can not hold 'em . grandpa ( to perry ) you are making a big mistake , officer . big mistake . you are lettin ' the monster out . trooper perry that may well be , old man . may well be . you can not hold somebody on suspicion of being a monster . ( to the driver ) you can roll 'em anytime . driver ( to padgett ) all right . are they sure about that bridge ? i do not like that sucker . she swings in the wind and she is not a suspension . trooper padgett ( jerks a thumb at the phone ) that was the county engineer . the bridge has been checked out and declared passable . we will go on ahead , cross the bridge first . some of the customers begin rising to leave . counterman ( relieved , moves to the cash register ) all right . you can pay your checks right over here , ladies and gentlemen . godspeed and safe trip . and you all come back and see us again , y'hear ? ( more ) counterman ( cont 'd ) that is , all but one of ya . everyone begins to rise , collect their things , and move to the cash register . counterman ( to grandpa ) you had the chili , right ? that is ninety cents . thank you . ( to the businessman ) and you had , what ? fourteen cups o ' coffee , that was a dollar forty ... dissolve to outside the diner , trooper padgett and the driver stand on either side of the bus door as the travelers board the bus . grandpa is already seated up front as the older married couple board , followed by the blonde . blonde ( to padgett ) goodbye , officer . trooper padgett ( casually salutes her ) miss mcconnell . padgett and the driver watch with much interest as the blonde boards the bus , keeping a close watch on her shapely legs . once she is safely aboard , padgett and the driver exchange satisfied glances . driver ( to padgett ) well , i counted seven . trooper padgett that is right , seven . grandpa betcha by the time we get to boston , there 'll be seventeen ! grandpa laughs as we dissolve to inside the diner , some time later . the jukebox cues up a record and begins to play . cut to the outside of the diner . through the front window , we see that the place is empty except for the counterman . the businessman , his coat still draped over his shoulders , trudges through the snow , stops to peer at the counterman through the window , then walks inside the diner , and sits at the counter . the counterman , doing some bookkeeping , is surprised to see him . counterman something for ya ? businessman coffee . black . counterman one coffee , black . ( pours coffee ) hey , uh , did not you , uh , what i mean is ... did not you go out on that bus ? ( serves the coffee ) businessman i did indeed . oh , yes , i went out on that bus . and you know something ? that bridge was not safe . it collapsed . the state police car , the bus , everything -- kerplunk -right into the river . it was a terrible scene . no one got out . counterman ( incredulous ) except you . businessman except me . lucky , i guess , huh ? counterman very lucky . but ... but ... businessman but what ? counterman you are not even wet . businessman wet ? what is `` wet '' ? counterman what do you mean `` what is wet '' ? you landed in the river but you are clothes are all dry . businessman an illusion , that is all . just an illusion . like that jukebox playing in the corner . that is an illusion , too . the counterman looks at the jukebox and it abruptly stops playing . silence . businessman or that telephone ringing . the phone rings . businessman that is an illusion . just a parlor trick . counterman what are ya , some kind of magician ? a third arm emerges from under the businessman 's coat . using his three hands , he takes from his pockets a box of cigarettes and a book of matches . businessman who , me ? oh , hardly . the counterman stares in amazement as the three-handed businessman lights a cigarette . businessman now , uh , before you , uh , faint dead away , i ought to explain that the name is not really ross . and i was not really going to boston . no , i was sent as a kind of advanced scout . you know these , uh , cigarettes , do you call them ? they taste wonderful . ( more ) businessman ( cont 'd ) we have not got a thing like this on mars . that is , incidentally , where i come from . we are beginning to colonize . my friends will be arriving very shortly . i think they are going to like it here . lovely area , so ... so remote , so pleasant , so off-thebeaten track . just the perfect spot for a colony , do not you think , mr. haley ? while we are waiting , how about a little what you call music ? counterman i do not mind . i have to do a little waiting myself . you see , mr. ross , my name is not haley . and i do agree with you , this is an extraordinary place to colonize . we folks on venus had the same idea . we got it several years ago . and i think i really ought to tell you now that your friends are not coming . they have been intercepted . oh , a colony is coming . but it is from venus . and if you are still alive , i think you will see how we differ . the counterman removes his cap , revealing a third eye in the middle of his forehead . the businessman 's face sours at this . counterman and i agree with you about what they call music . why do not you play some ? the counterman busts out laughing . narrator ( voice over ) incident on a small island , to be believed or disbelieved . however , if a sour-faced dandy named ross or a big , good-natured counterman who handles a spatula as if he had been born with one in his mouth , if either of these two entities walks onto your premises , you would better hold their hands -all three of them -- or check the color of their eyes -- all three of them . ( more ) narrator ( cont 'd ) the gentlemen in question might try to pull you into ... the twilight zone . pan up from the outside of the diner , dissolve to a starry sky , and fade out .
