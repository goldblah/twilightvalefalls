THE TWILIGHT ZONE
Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?

Written by
Rod Serling

ACT ONE
FADE IN on a brief montage of snow-covered mountains and
woods on an ISLAND somewhere in the northeastern United
States, accompanied by some odd noises -- what sounds like
it could be an alien spaceship FLYING overhead and CRASHING
into an ice-covered pond. Snow falls throughout.
WIPE TO
Two state troopers, PADGETT, the veteran, and PERRY, a
younger man, flashlights in hand as they peer into the
darkness of the WOODS. The snow continues to fall.
TROOPER PADGETT
See anything?
TROOPER PERRY
The tops of some trees have been knocked
down. Looks like something hit that pond.
Whatever it is, it'll be under the ice till
next spring.
TROOPER PADGETT
A meteor or something, probably. I'd better
check in. That woman who phoned said
something about calling out the National
Guard.
He opens the door to their patrol car and grabs the radio
mike.
TROOPER PADGETT
(into the mike)
This is one-one-eight-three-A, one-oneeight-three-A, reporting a check out.
DISPATCHER
Go ahead.
TROOPER PADGETT
(to the dispatcher)
Checking out a report on an unidentified
flying object. Supposed to have landed in
the area of Hook's Landing. Appears
something cut off the tops of some trees.
(MORE)

TROOPER PADGETT (CONT'D)
Came down in the ice at Tracy's Pond and we
can't see it now.
As Padgett talks, Perry discovers TRACKS in the snow.
TROOPER PERRY
Bill?
TROOPER PADGETT
(to the dispatcher)
Hold on a second.
(to Perry)
Yeah?
TROOPER PERRY
There're footprints up here. They come up
from the pond. Looks like they got out of
whatever landed.
TROOPER PADGETT
(to the dispatcher)
There appears to be some evidence that -Well, we'll call you back.
DISPATCHER
What's it all about?
TROOPER PADGETT
We don't know yet.
DISPATCHER
How's that?
TROOPER PADGETT
We'll, uh -- we'll call you back in a
little bit.
DISPATCHER
All right, Padgett. But there's some talk
of a bridge going out up there. When you
can, you better take a look and make sure
she's posted and blocked off. Enough ice
jammed up against it to cool the Congo.

TROOPER PADGETT
Roger and out.
Padgett shuts the car door and joins Perry by the tracks.
Light from a roadside diner glows in the distance.
TROOPER PERRY
No question about it. Something left that
pond and went over to the diner.
TROOPER PADGETT
Looks like a bus in front of that diner.
You don't suppose it came out of that pond,
do you?
TROOPER PERRY
Very funny.
TROOPER PADGETT
Sorry. Let's leave the car and follow these
tracks. I want to be sure they lead to the
diner.
The troopers walk through the woods, following the tracks
with their flashlights, oblivious to the omniscient
NARRATOR they pass along the way. The narrator wears a
stylish overcoat, carries a lit cigarette, and speaks
directly to the audience.
NARRATOR
Wintry February night, the present. Order
of events: a phone call from a frightened
woman notating the arrival of an
unidentified flying object, and the checkout you've just witnessed with two state
troopers verifying the event, but with
nothing more enlightening to add beyond
evidence of some tracks leading across the
highway to a diner. You've heard of trying
to find a needle in a haystack? Well, stay
with us now and you'll be part of an
investigating team whose mission is not to
find that proverbial needle. No, their task
is even harder. They've got to find a
Martian in a diner, and in just a moment
you'll search with them, because you've

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
just landed... in the Twilight Zone.
FADE OUT
FADE IN
ON THE EMPTY OLD BUS (marked "CAYUGA BUS COMPANY") parked
just OUTSIDE THE DINER. We PAN TO the front of the bus to
include a view of the diner's large front window ("HI-WAY
CAFE") through which we can see that the place is filled
with customers. The troopers arrive, look over the bus, and
enter the diner.
Perry and Padgett walk INSIDE THE DINER, brush the snow off
their uniforms, and scan the customers: a middle-aged
married couple, smoking cigarettes; the bus DRIVER,
drinking coffee; a young married couple, rubbing noses; a
no-nonsense BUSINESSMAN with his coat draped over his
shoulders; all seated at tables. Seated at the counter,
hunched over a bowl of chili so that his face can't be
seen, is an old man we'll call GRANDPA. Opposite Grandpa is
the diner's COUNTERMAN who looks at the troopers with
concern.
COUNTERMAN
(to the troopers)
Trouble?
Padgett glances over at another customer, seated at a
corner table, an extremely attractive BLONDE, blowing
cigarette smoke. The troopers exchange looks with one
another and then address the crowd.
TROOPER PERRY
Who's bus is this out here?
DRIVER
(putting on his cap)
That's mine, officer. What's the problem?
TROOPER PERRY
The bridge up ahead has been declared
temporarily impassable. Ice floe stacked up
against it.
(MORE)

TROOPER PERRY (CONT'D)
Another pound of weight and it could be
driftwood.
DRIVER
That's rough. Can't turn around and go
back. There's a slide up there at the turnoff. Blocked the whole road.
COUNTERMAN
(takes toothpick from his
mouth)
Looks like you're kind o' marooned.
TROOPER PERRY
Till morning anyway.
BUSINESSMAN
Till morning? I've got to be in Boston at
nine a.m.
DRIVER
(to the businessman)
Then you better start walking, mister,
'cause that bus stays out there till they
fix the bridge. Either that, or have 'em
drop some snowshoes.
TROOPER PERRY
So, you might as well get comfortable and
get a little hot food in ya.
BUSINESSMAN
Oh, that's just great. That's fine, isn't
it? Get comfortable and get a little hot
food in you. That's precious little
consolation for missing my meeting in
Boston.
(rises, laughs, crosses to
the driver, and sits at his
table)
That's a fine little bus line you work for,
isn't it? They care so much about their
schedules, don't they?

DRIVER
I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, mister. They
have no control over the snow, bridges, the
sides of hills that decide to come down.
That's pretty much out of their hands.
The troopers scan the customers again.
TROOPER PERRY
(quietly, to Padgett)
What do you think?
TROOPER PADGETT
They were all on that bus, weren't they?
COUNTERMAN
(to the troopers)
What's the trouble? You looking for
somebody?
TROOPER PADGETT
(crosses to the driver)
Driver, um, have you got a passenger
manifest?
DRIVER
Passenger manifest? What do you think I got
parked out there? A 707? Mister, that's a
fourteen year old bus and business is
lousy. My boss'd run rum across the border
if there was a profit in it. I don't ask
passengers their names. We kiss 'em gently
and help 'em in. We're that glad to have
'em, with or without names.
TROOPER PERRY
Know how many you had?
DRIVER
Six. Unless one of 'em fell out the window
when we hit a bump. I picked up six and I'm
supposed to deliver six.
TROOPER PADGETT
(glances around)
Nobody fell out.
(MORE)

TROOPER PADGETT (CONT'D)
Somebody must've jumped in. There're seven
here now.
DRIVER
(rises, silently counts the
customers)
That's funny. I know I had six people.
Padgett crosses to the counter, where the counterman sets
down a cup of coffee for him.
TROOPER PADGETT
(to the counterman)
Thanks. Now, tell me, was there anybody in
here before the bus stopped?
COUNTERMAN
No, I haven't served anybody since eleven
o'clock this morning. I figured this whole
bunch got off the bus.
DRIVER
We did. There was no one in here when we
came in.
TROOPER PERRY
Then how do you account for seven people?
DRIVER
That one beats me.
(it dawns on him)
One of them didn't get off the bus.
(sits back down)
TROOPER PERRY
Which one of you wasn't on the bus?
BUSINESSMAN
(annoyed)
We were all on the bus. What kind of
interrogation is this, anyway? If we're
going to be grilled, I want to talk to a
lawyer.
The old man at the counter cackles and turns around, his
wild-eyed face visible for the first time.

GRANDPA
That's a good one. First, he wants
snowshoes, then he wants a lawyer.
BUSINESSMAN
(pointedly, to Grandpa)
I don't remember seeing you on the bus.
GRANDPA
(to the businessman)
That's quite funny, 'cause I don't remember
seeing you neither.
(winks at the driver)
Makes one of us a liar, don't it?
Grandpa and the driver laugh at this.
This is
it make
whether
hundred
Gestapo

BUSINESSMAN
preposterous. What difference does
who was on the bus or who wasn't or
there were six or seven or a
and twenty? Is this a diner or
headquarters?

COUNTERMAN
(to the businessman)
Aw, now take it easy, mister.
(to the troopers)
What's it all about?
TROOPER PERRY
(to the counterman)
Did you hear anything flying over here
tonight?
HALEY
Flying over here? No, I didn't hear
anything.
TROOPER PERRY
We got a call about two hours ago. Woman
said she heard something fly over and then
come down.

COUNTERMAN
Fly over here? From where?
TROOPER PADGETT
From up there.
(rolls his eyes heavenward)
An unidentified flying object.
COUNTERMAN
Unidentified flying object?
(chuckles)
Nothing's come down from up there 'cept
snow. That's all I've seen for the past
fourteen hours, snow. Where'd she say it
came down?
TROOPER PERRY
Close to here.
TROOPER PADGETT
Look, something did land in Tracy's Pond.
Left a trail of broken branches before it
hit. We found tracks leading away from it.
COUNTERMAN
To where?
TROOPER PADGETT
To here.
COUNTERMAN
(amused)
You mean something landed in Tracy's Pond
and then came in here? That's crazy.
Nothing's come in here since eleven this
morning. Nothing, except...
DRIVER
Except me and my passengers. Me and six
people. That means that one person here...
Now it's the driver's turn to look heavenward. It's an
unsettling thought.

YOUNG WIFE
(quietly, to her husband)
George, I don't like this.
YOUNG HUSBAND
Easy, honey, easy.
OLD HUSBAND
(to the troopers)
Now, let me get this straight. You're
trying to tell us that there's one person
in here who landed in some kind of a saucer
or something and then came in here?
BLONDE
Came in here with us?
Padgett nods.
BUSINESSMAN
Well, that's just not possible. We'd've
seen them.
OLD HUSBAND
Not necessarily. It's snowing and dark. We
climbed off of that bus with our eyes
closed to get out of the snow. Anyone
could've come in with us and we wouldn't've
noticed.
TROOPER PADGETT
You were all on the bus together. You would
have known who the other passengers were.
DRIVER
Well, that don't cut any ice. They loaded
in the snow at Hook's Landing. Tell you the
truth, I don't know who got on.
GRANDPA
She's just like a science fiction, that's
what she is! A regular Ray Bradbury! Six
humans and one monster from outer space.
(to the businessman)
You wouldn't happen to have an eye in the
(MORE)

GRANDPA (CONT'D)
back of your head, would you?
The driver cracks up.
BUSINESSMAN
(to Grandpa)
Look, I find you offensive, you know that?
Grandpa winks at the driver.
BLONDE
(to Padgett)
What do you do now, officer?
TROOPER PADGETT
(to the blonde)
Look, lady, this isn't exactly par for our
courses either. We go off on a lot of nutty
assignments, but this one -- wow!
BLONDE
Well, I know how you begin. You pair off
the couples. Since it's just one person who
doesn't belong here, you... you eliminate
the couples.
The older couple smile and nod their heads.
OLD HUSBAND
(a little smugly)
We're exonerated. Cross us off. We're two
of the humans.
YOUNG HUSBAND
Us, too. My wife and I. We're in the clear.
He clutches his wife's hand with its ringed finger. But his
wife looks at him doubtfully.
YOUNG HUSBAND
(to his wife)
What's the matter?

YOUNG WIFE
I-I could have sworn you had a mole on your
chin.
YOUNG HUSBAND
A mole on my chin? Connie, I never had a
mole on my chin.
OLD HUSBAND
(rises)
I can tell you what's going to happen.
We're all going to get so panicky that
everyone and his brother will start picking
up invisible clues from everybody else.
This is nonsense.
(sits)
OLD WIFE
Well, of course, it's nonsense. If a
husband and wife suddenly start wondering
whether the husband is really the husband
and the wife... is ...really...
Now, this wife looks doubtfully at her own husband.
OLD HUSBAND
(indignant, to his wife)
Now, wait a minute! I think twenty-three
years is long enough for a woman to know
who she's married to -- so, I'll thank you
to stop looking at me as if I just put on
this face as part of a costume.
Not entirely reassured, the old wife puffs on her cigarette
nervously.
GRANDPA
(laughs)
I love this. She don't know who he is. He
don't know who she is. We don't know who
she is. And this lemon-sucker here
(points to the businessman)
-- he's the most suspicious of the bunch.
Again, the driver can't help but laugh at Grandpa. The
businessman shakes his head in disgust.

TROOPER PERRY
(to the counterman)
Have you got a back door to this place?
COUNTERMAN
Sure. Why?
TROOPER PADGETT
Go back there and lock it.
COUNTERMAN
Well, it's already locked. If that certain
somebody really is from outer space,
they'll just go through the wall anyway.
GRANDPA
(waves his hat, to the
troopers)
Check 'em for wings! Check 'em for wings!
Look under their coats!
The driver busts out laughing again. Perry is getting a
little fed up with Grandpa's outbursts.
TROOPER PERRY
(crosses to Grandpa)
You got identification, grandpa?
GRANDPA
(pauses and squints at
Perry)
Left it down in the pond in my spaceship.
TROOPER PERRY
(to Grandpa)
Who won the World Series race last year?
BUSINESSMAN
What is this, a sort of prolonged practical
joke?
GRANDPA
(to all)
I get it! I get it!
(to Perry)
Pittsburgh Pirates won it -- took four out
(MORE)

GRANDPA (CONT'D)
of seven from the Yankees.
(to all)
Sharp boys, real sharp boys!
(to Perry)
Didn't figure us Martians would know
nothin' about the great American pastime,
did ya? Huh? Huh?
Grandpa cackles. The blonde laughs at him.
TROOPER PADGETT
(crosses to the blonde)
You got identification, miss?
BLONDE
Well, no, as a matter of fact, I don't. I
left my wallet -- I left it in my suitcase.
It was shipped on ahead.
TROOPER PADGETT
What's your name, miss?
BLONDE
Ethel McConnell. I'm a... professional
dancer.
GRANDPA
How many legs? How many legs?
BLONDE
I'm gonna belt you, grandpa.
DRIVER
(grinning, to the troopers,
with certainty)
She was on the bus.
TROOPER PADGETT
How do you know?
DRIVER
(looking her over)
She's the only one I noticed.

BLONDE
(smiling, to the driver)
Well, thank you.
GRANDPA
But who noticed him?
The driver laughs again, but stops -- realizing the joke's
on him.
GRANDPA
(to the driver)
How do we know you're the same one driving
the bus? Huh?
(to all)
Ain't nobody been exonerated yet, that's
for sure!
BUSINESSMAN
Look, let's cut this farce out right now.
We'll all show our identifications and put
a stop to it. The whole thing's ridiculous.
OLD HUSBAND
(arms folded, to the
businessman)
Then, how do you explain the extra person
in here?
OLD WIFE
Yes, how about that?
BUSINESSMAN
Very simple. The driver is mistaken. Seven
people got on the bus and he thought there
were only six.
TROOPER PADGETT
(crosses to the driver)
Is that possible?
DRIVER
Not a chance in the world. I counted heads
before we took off.

(pointedly, to the
businessman)
There were six people.
TROOPER PADGETT
(crosses to the blonde)
Miss...?
The jukebox suddenly lights up and starts BLASTING a
record. All eyes turn to it. Just as suddenly, the music
grinds to a halt. The lights in the rest of the diner begin
to flicker on and off. Padgett puts a hand on his holstered
gun, ready for anything. After a moment, things return to
normal. But everyone is slightly spooked.
COUNTERMAN
What caused that?
Perry inspects the jukebox.
TROOPER PADGETT
(to all)
We, er, we may get a laugh out of all this
in the morning. In the meantime, everyone
stay right where they are.
The blonde, Grandpa, and the driver glance nervously
overhead. The businessman looks discouraged. The older
married couple look around at the others. The younger
couple looks at one another. And the counterman can't
believe this is happening.
FADE OUT
END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE IN
on the INSIDE OF THE DINER, later that night, as the
counterman emerges from the back, wiping his hand. He sees
the driver now seated with the blonde at her table. They
seem to be enjoying one another's company.
COUNTERMAN
(to the driver)
Where're the troopers?
DRIVER
Hm? Oh, stepped outside.
(peers out the window)
Snow stopped.
(to the counterman)
Say, Haley...
(points to the jukebox)
That wasn't your gag, was it? I mean, the
business about the jukebox starting like
that.
COUNTERMAN
(puts up his hands, retreats
to behind the counter)
Not me! I'm strictly short orders and "pay
your taxes" -- I don't know anything about
science fiction. A jukebox is a jukebox and
if that thing wants to start up all on its
own, you'll check with an electrical
engineer.
Grandpa gets a fiendish glint in his eye, rises from his
stool at the counter, and approaches the jukebox. Abruptly,
he straightens up and salutes it.
GRANDPA
(to the jukebox)
Take me to your leader!
(laughs, to all)
Take me to your leader!
Grandpa calms down a little as the troopers enter the
diner. The two married couples, quietly napping at their

tables, awaken. Padgett sits at the counter across from the
counterman.
COUNTERMAN
(to the troopers)
Find anything?
TROOPER PERRY
No. Took a look at the bridge.
TROOPER PADGETT
Holding up pretty well.
DRIVER
I know that bridge, and what's more, I
don't trust it.
BUSINESSMAN
(to the driver)
Well, thank goodness we needn't concern
ourselves with your judgment. If the bridge
gets a clean bill of health, you'll drive
that bus right across it.
DRIVER
(to the businessman)
Listen, mister. You may be a big shot in
Boston, but when it comes to bridges and
busses, I got seniority. And I tell you,
that bridge is so old that at any -The lights go out. Everyone looks around nervously.
BLONDE
Hey, what is this?
(the lights come back on)
Why did the lights go out like that?
COUNTERMAN
We may be losing power.
The JUKEBOX starts up again, startling Grandpa and Trooper
Perry who stand beside it.
COUNTERMAN
This is weird. This is just plain weird.
The jukebox dies again. The tension in the room thickens.

BLONDE
Well, I wish whoever it is would play his
cards right now.
YOUNG WIFE
(agitated)
Why don't they do something? What's the
point of us all staying cooped up in here
like this and....
The young husband comforts her.
TROOPER PERRY
(to the young wife)
The point is this, miss. We're all kids in
a closet here. Nobody understands what's
going on. If there was some kind of a
saucer that landed in that pond, and he did
come in here, I think it'd be a real
healthy idea if we pinpointed that
particular somebody and kept him from
leaving.
COUNTERMAN
Makes sense. Maybe whoever it is, is
invisible. Maybe they're just playin'
around. Cat and mouse.
BUSINESSMAN
That is childish nonsense.
OLD HUSBAND
It's as good an explanation as any I've
heard. But what if the... the thing doesn't
show itself? Do we just sit here holding
our breath?
OLD WIFE
Yeah, how 'bout that?
GRANDPA
Well, if somebody was to ask me--

BUSINESSMAN
(interrupts, sharply)
Well, no one did ask you. No one will.
Grandpa stops short, mouth open.
BLONDE
(offended, to the
businessman)
Why don't you leave the old man alone?
BUSINESSMAN
Who invited you into this?
BLONDE
Well, I didn't realize we were waiting for
invitations, but you've got this big thing
about bossing everybody around.
Grandpa nods in agreement.
OLD HUSBAND
Look, it's tough enough just sitting here
without-Abruptly, the lights flicker off and on, off and on, for a
long, eerie moment. As soon as the lights come back on, the
sugar bowls on the two married couples' tables suddenly
flip over. The wives scream. Padgett and Perry draw their
guns and cover the doors.
TROOPER PADGETT
(to Grandpa)
Get over there and sit down, gramps.
Grandpa sits at the counter. The businessman glances at the
diner's pay PHONE just as it RINGS. Padgett answers it on
the second ring.
TROOPER PADGETT
(into the phone)
Yeah? ... What's that? It's okay? ... All
right, thanks.
(hanging up, to all)
The bridge is okay.

BUSINESSMAN
Well. It's about time. Shall we go?
The troopers re-holster their guns and confer.
TROOPER PADGETT
What do you think, Perry?
TROOPER PERRY
Can't hold 'em.
GRANDPA
(to Perry)
You're making a big mistake, officer. Big
mistake. You're lettin' the monster out.
TROOPER PERRY
That may well be, old man. May well be. You
can't hold somebody on suspicion of being a
monster.
(to the driver)
You can roll 'em anytime.
DRIVER
(to Padgett)
All right. Are they sure about that bridge?
I don't like that sucker. She swings in the
wind and she's not a suspension.
TROOPER PADGETT
(jerks a thumb at the phone)
That was the county engineer. The bridge
has been checked out and declared passable.
We'll go on ahead, cross the bridge first.
Some of the customers begin rising to leave.

COUNTERMAN
(relieved, moves to the cash
register)
All right. You can pay your checks right
over here, ladies and gentlemen. Godspeed
and safe trip. And y'all come back and see
us again, y'hear?
(MORE)

COUNTERMAN (CONT'D)
That is, all but one of ya.
Everyone begins to rise, collect their things, and move to
the cash register.
COUNTERMAN
(to Grandpa)
You had the chili, right? That's ninety
cents. Thank you.
(to the businessman)
And you had, what? Fourteen cups o' coffee,
that was a dollar forty...
DISSOLVE TO
OUTSIDE THE DINER, Trooper Padgett and the driver stand on
either side of the bus door as the travelers board the bus.
Grandpa is already seated up front as the older married
couple board, followed by the blonde.
BLONDE
(to Padgett)
Goodbye, officer.
TROOPER PADGETT
(casually salutes her)
Miss McConnell.
Padgett and the driver watch with much interest as the
blonde boards the bus, keeping a close watch on her shapely
legs. Once she's safely aboard, Padgett and the driver
exchange satisfied glances.
DRIVER
(to Padgett)
Well, I counted seven.
TROOPER PADGETT
That's right, seven.
GRANDPA
Betcha by the time we get to Boston,
there'll be seventeen!
Grandpa laughs as we DISSOLVE TO
INSIDE THE DINER, some time later. The jukebox cues up a

record and begins to PLAY.
CUT TO the OUTSIDE OF THE DINER. Through the front window,
we see that the place is empty except for the counterman.
The businessman, his coat still draped over his shoulders,
trudges through the snow, stops to peer at the counterman
through the window, then walks INSIDE THE DINER, and sits
at the counter. The counterman, doing some bookkeeping, is
surprised to see him.
COUNTERMAN
Something for ya?
BUSINESSMAN
Coffee. Black.
COUNTERMAN
One coffee, black.
(pours coffee)
Hey, uh, didn't you, uh, what I mean is...
Didn't you go out on that bus?
(serves the coffee)
BUSINESSMAN
I did indeed. Oh, yes, I went out on that
bus. And you know something? That bridge
wasn't safe. It collapsed. The state police
car, the bus, everything -- kerplunk -right into the river. It was a terrible
scene. No one got out.
COUNTERMAN
(incredulous)
Except you.
BUSINESSMAN
Except me. Lucky, I guess, huh?
COUNTERMAN
Very lucky. But... but...
BUSINESSMAN
But what?

COUNTERMAN
You're not even wet.
BUSINESSMAN
Wet? What's "wet"?
COUNTERMAN
What do you mean "what's wet"? You landed
in the river but you're clothes are all
dry.
BUSINESSMAN
An illusion, that's all. Just an illusion.
Like that jukebox playing in the corner.
That's an illusion, too.
The counterman looks at the JUKEBOX and it abruptly stops
playing. Silence.
BUSINESSMAN
Or that telephone ringing.
The phone RINGS.
BUSINESSMAN
That's an illusion. Just a parlor trick.
COUNTERMAN
What are ya, some kind of magician?
A third arm emerges from under the businessman's coat.
Using his three hands, he takes from his pockets a box of
cigarettes and a book of matches.
BUSINESSMAN
Who, me? Oh, hardly.
The counterman stares in amazement as the three-handed
businessman lights a cigarette.
BUSINESSMAN
Now, uh, before you, uh, faint dead away, I
ought to explain that the name isn't really
Ross. And I wasn't really going to Boston.
No, I was sent as a kind of advanced scout.
You know these, uh, cigarettes, do you call
them? They taste wonderful.
(MORE)

BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
We haven't got a thing like this on Mars.
That's, incidentally, where I come from.
We're beginning to colonize. My friends
will be arriving very shortly. I think
they're going to like it here. Lovely area,
so... so remote, so pleasant, so off-thebeaten track. Just the perfect spot for a
colony, don't you think, Mr. Haley? While
we're waiting, how about a little what you
call music?
COUNTERMAN
I don't mind. I have to do a little waiting
myself. You see, Mr. Ross, my name isn't
Haley. And I do agree with you, this is an
extraordinary place to colonize. We folks
on Venus had the same idea. We got it
several years ago. And I think I really
ought to tell you now that your friends are
not coming. They've been intercepted. Oh, a
colony is coming. But it's from Venus. And
if you're still alive, I think you'll see
how we differ.
The counterman removes his cap, revealing a third eye in
the middle of his forehead. The businessman's face sours at
this.
COUNTERMAN
And I agree with you about what they call
music. Why don't you play some?
The counterman busts out laughing.
NARRATOR
(voice over)
Incident on a small island, to be believed
or disbelieved. However, if a sour-faced
dandy named Ross or a big, good-natured
counterman who handles a spatula as if he'd
