(he waits impatiently, conscious of misrell staring at him)  misrell\u0027s voice (from opposite side of room) williams, we\u0027re still waiting for your mr. ross!  williams (with a forced smile, over his shoulder) ) i\u0027m trying to get him now, sir. (then into phone) this jake ross\u0027s secretary? joanie: where is he? i know he\u0027s out to lunch. but there was a conference called here at two o\u0027clock. it is now two—thirty, now where is he! (he wets his lips, forces his voice down an octave) all right, check around. (more)  (continued)  continued:  williams (cont\u0027d) call sardi\u0027s east or the colony and tell him to get his keister back here in a hurry!  he slams down the receiver then fixes his face into a smiling, nonchalant mask and returns to the table.  5. track shot with him  as he walks over to the table, sits down, again smiling toward mr. misrell.  6. close shot misrell who stares back at him, totally unsmiling.  misrell well? where is your protege with the three-million—dollar automobile account?  williams he‘s due at any moment, sir. probably a big lunch crowd or something—  misrell don\u0027t be an idiot. more likely a big martini, or three or four of \u0027em. he was too young to put on this account — i told you that, williams. he\u0027s much too young to put on this large and important an account-  there\u0027s a knock on the door.  7. moving shot with williams  as he springs to his feet and hurries over to the big, double conference room doors. he opens it up. a young secretary hands him an envelope which he literally pulls out of her hand, slams the door behind him, rips open the envelope, and starts to read.  8. extremely tight close shot williams‘ face  as suddenly he looks white, stares up over the letter briefly toward misrell.  9. close shot misrell  reacting.  10. close shot williams  as his eyes slowly go downward and the letter in his hand drops to his side. he carries it very slowly over to the table and stands there at the far end.  11. reverse angle looking over his shoulder  down the length of the table at misrell who very slowly drums on the table in a methodical, tapping that permeates the silence of the room.  misrell well? we have now been here thirty-four minutes, mr. williams.  williams (looks up from the letter, takes a deep breath) this is a communication from jake ross.  misrell would you be so kind as to share its contents with us?  12. med. close shot williams  as he looks down at the letter, spreads it out on the top of the table, then looks up from it.  williams i can tell you the sense of it very quickly, mr. misrell. this is jake ross\u0027s resignation. he\u0027s moving over to another agency.  13. close shot misrell as his face seems to freeze.  misrell and?  14. close shot williams as his face seems to freeze. williams  and he\u0027s taking the automobile account with him.  15. pan shot down the faces of the men  at the table as each seems to catch his breath and then look from misrell and with great compassion and concern over toward williams.  misrell did you hear what i said, williams? that account represented a gross billing of something in the neighborhood of three million dollars a year. and how many times have you promised it to me?  williams (clears his throat and for a moment can\u0027t get a word out) this is as much of a shock to me as it is to you, mr. misrell.  misrell (roaring) don\u0027t con me, williams! it was your pet project! your pet project: then it was your idea to give it to that little college greeny! now get with it, williams. get with it, boy!  he rises from his seat and goes to the window, his jowled, fleshy face screwed up like a little baby about to cry; now he whirls around toward williams, points a finger at him.  misrell (cont \u0027 d) so what\u0027s left, williams? not only has your pet project backfired but it\u0027s sprouted wings and left the premises! i\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s left to us in my view! a deep and abiding concern about your judgment in men!  16. pan shot down the faces of the men  each of whom look down at their hands in a vast, biting embarrassment.  17. close shot williams  as he closes his eyes for a moment, feels the sweat on his forehead and then unconsciously massages his stomach as an ulcer deep inside lights a match to his insides.  18. close shot misrell  as he returns to the table, pounds the flats of his hands down on it.  misrell this is a push business, williams! a push, push, push business. push and drive, but personally. you don\u0027t delegate responsibilities to little boys.  19. close shot williams  as he looks sick.  misrell\u0027s voice you should know it more than anyone else.  the camera dollies in for an extremely tight, tight close shot of misrell\u0027s face shooting at just the nose and little oval mouth that goes up and down and up and down. misrell  a push, push, push business, williams.  it\u0027s push, push, push all the way. all  the time. right on down the line— 20. extremely tight close shot williams as suddenly he can\u0027t stand it any longer and shouts out.  williams fat boy, why don\u0027t you shut your mouth!  21.—25. series of abrupt cuts from face to face  of the men at the table, then misrell, then williams who suddenly exhales and realizes that the voice that suddenly exploded in the room like shrapnel was his own!  25a. insert coffee cup  drops to floor.  26. different angle williams  as he closes his eyes for a moment, grabs at his stomach very tightly as once again the ulcer makes an assault on him, then  he turns and walks quietly out of the room.  cut to:  27. ext. conference room a line of desks  two secretaries whisper to one another as he goes past them. 28. track shot williams  as he continues to walk through the office.  cut to:  29. int. different office area  williams\u0027s secretary, helen, sits at a desk and looks up as williams approaches. she forces a smile.  helen messages on the desk, boss. and hot coffee out here. can i bring you some?  he shakes his head and starts toward the door.  helen want anything at all?  he turns from the door and stares at her.  williams yeah. a sharp razor and a chart of the human anatomy showing where all the arteries are!  he goes into the office and slams the door behind him. 30. int. williams\u0027s office  fluorescent tube lighting is on all around the room and the first thing he does is flick off the switch putting the room into a semi—darkness. then he walks over to a big, modern, expensive—looking desk, looks briefly at the picture of a beautiful woman on it, then sits down behind the desk and stares down at nothing. over this tableau we hear the narrator\u0027s voice.  narrator’s voice this is gart williams, age thirty—eight, a man protected by a suit of armor all held together by one bolt. just a moment ago, someone removed the bolt and mr. williams‘s protection fell away from him and left him a naked target. he\u0027s been cannonaded this afternoon by all the enemies of his life. his insecurity has shelled him;  (more)  (continued)  continued:  narrator\u0027s voice (cont\u0027d) his sensitivity has straddled him with humiliation; his deep-rooted disquiet about his own worth has zeroed in on him, landed on target, and blown him apart. mr. gart williams, ad agency exec, who in just a moment will move into the twilight zone in a desperate search for survival!  fade to black opening billboard first commercial fade on:  31. int. commuter train [night] long shot down length of one of cars  a conductor comes into the frame from behind the camera collecting the tickets of the few passengers who remain. dolly in with him toward williams who sits by himself at the far end of the car. conductor takes his ticket, punches it.  32. two shot the two men  conductor one how are you tonight, mr. williams?
