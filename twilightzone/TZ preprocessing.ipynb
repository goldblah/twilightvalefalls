(he waits impatiently, conscious of misrell staring at him)  misrell's voice (from opposite side of room) williams, we're still waiting for your mr. ross!  williams (with a forced smile, over his shoulder) ) i'm trying to get him now, sir. (then into phone) this jake ross's secretary? joanie: where is he? i know he's out to lunch. but there was a conference called here at two o'clock. it is now two—thirty, now where is he! (he wets his lips, forces his voice down an octave) all right, check around. (more)  (continued)  continued:  williams (cont'd) call sardi's east or the colony and tell him to get his keister back here in a hurry!  he slams down the receiver then fixes his face into a smiling, nonchalant mask and returns to the table.  5. track shot with him  as he walks over to the table, sits down, again smiling toward mr. misrell.  6. close shot misrell who stares back at him, totally unsmiling.  misrell well? where is your protege with the three-million—dollar automobile account?  williams he‘s due at any moment, sir. probably a big lunch crowd or something—  misrell don't be an idiot. more likely a big martini, or three or four of 'em. he was too young to put on this account — i told you that, williams. he's much too young to put on this large and important an account-  there's a knock on the door.  7. moving shot with williams  as he springs to his feet and hurries over to the big, double conference room doors. he opens it up. a young secretary hands him an envelope which he literally pulls out of her hand, slams the door behind him, rips open the envelope, and starts to read.  8. extremely tight close shot williams‘ face  as suddenly he looks white, stares up over the letter briefly toward misrell.  9. close shot misrell  reacting.  10. close shot williams  as his eyes slowly go downward and the letter in his hand drops to his side. he carries it very slowly over to the table and stands there at the far end.  11. reverse angle looking over his shoulder  down the length of the table at misrell who very slowly drums on the table in a methodical, tapping that permeates the silence of the room.  misrell well? we have now been here thirty-four minutes, mr. williams.  williams (looks up from the letter, takes a deep breath) this is a communication from jake ross.  misrell would you be so kind as to share its contents with us?  12. med. close shot williams  as he looks down at the letter, spreads it out on the top of the table, then looks up from it.  williams i can tell you the sense of it very quickly, mr. misrell. this is jake ross's resignation. he's moving over to another agency.  13. close shot misrell as his face seems to freeze.  misrell and?  14. close shot williams as his face seems to freeze. williams  and he's taking the automobile account with him.  15. pan shot down the faces of the men  at the table as each seems to catch his breath and then look from misrell and with great compassion and concern over toward williams.  misrell did you hear what i said, williams? that account represented a gross billing of something in the neighborhood of three million dollars a year. and how many times have you promised it to me?  williams (clears his throat and for a moment can't get a word out) this is as much of a shock to me as it is to you, mr. misrell.  misrell (roaring) don't con me, williams! it was your pet project! your pet project: then it was your idea to give it to that little college greeny! now get with it, williams. get with it, boy!  he rises from his seat and goes to the window, his jowled, fleshy face screwed up like a little baby about to cry; now he whirls around toward williams, points a finger at him.  misrell (cont ' d) so what's left, williams? not only has your pet project backfired but it's sprouted wings and left the premises! i'll tell you what's left to us in my view! a deep and abiding concern about your judgment in men!  16. pan shot down the faces of the men  each of whom look down at their hands in a vast, biting embarrassment.  17. close shot williams  as he closes his eyes for a moment, feels the sweat on his forehead and then unconsciously massages his stomach as an ulcer deep inside lights a match to his insides.  18. close shot misrell  as he returns to the table, pounds the flats of his hands down on it.  misrell this is a push business, williams! a push, push, push business. push and drive, but personally. you don't delegate responsibilities to little boys.  19. close shot williams  as he looks sick.  misrell's voice you should know it more than anyone else.  the camera dollies in for an extremely tight, tight close shot of misrell's face shooting at just the nose and little oval mouth that goes up and down and up and down. misrell  a push, push, push business, williams.  it's push, push, push all the way. all  the time. right on down the line— 20. extremely tight close shot williams as suddenly he can't stand it any longer and shouts out.  williams fat boy, why don't you shut your mouth!  21.—25. series of abrupt cuts from face to face  of the men at the table, then misrell, then williams who suddenly exhales and realizes that the voice that suddenly exploded in the room like shrapnel was his own!  25a. insert coffee cup  drops to floor.  26. different angle williams  as he closes his eyes for a moment, grabs at his stomach very tightly as once again the ulcer makes an assault on him, then  he turns and walks quietly out of the room.  cut to:  27. ext. conference room a line of desks  two secretaries whisper to one another as he goes past them. 28. track shot williams  as he continues to walk through the office.  cut to:  29. int. different office area  williams's secretary, helen, sits at a desk and looks up as williams approaches. she forces a smile.  helen messages on the desk, boss. and hot coffee out here. can i bring you some?  he shakes his head and starts toward the door.  helen want anything at all?  he turns from the door and stares at her.  williams yeah. a sharp razor and a chart of the human anatomy showing where all the arteries are!  he goes into the office and slams the door behind him. 30. int. williams's office  fluorescent tube lighting is on all around the room and the first thing he does is flick off the switch putting the room into a semi—darkness. then he walks over to a big, modern, expensive—looking desk, looks briefly at the picture of a beautiful woman on it, then sits down behind the desk and stares down at nothing. over this tableau we hear the narrator's voice.  narrator’s voice this is gart williams, age thirty—eight, a man protected by a suit of armor all held together by one bolt. just a moment ago, someone removed the bolt and mr. williams‘s protection fell away from him and left him a naked target. he's been cannonaded this afternoon by all the enemies of his life. his insecurity has shelled him;  (more)  (continued)  continued:  narrator's voice (cont'd) his sensitivity has straddled him with humiliation; his deep-rooted disquiet about his own worth has zeroed in on him, landed on target, and blown him apart. mr. gart williams, ad agency exec, who in just a moment will move into the twilight zone in a desperate search for survival!  fade to black opening billboard first commercial fade on:  31. int. commuter train [night] long shot down length of one of cars  a conductor comes into the frame from behind the camera collecting the tickets of the few passengers who remain. dolly in with him toward williams who sits by himself at the far end of the car. conductor takes his ticket, punches it.  32. two shot the two men  conductor one how are you tonight, mr. williams?  williams (looks up, tiredly, with a wry grin) in the absolute pink!  he turns and looks out toward the wintry, dark landscape.  conductor one cold winter this year. seems to get darker earlier than it ever has.  williams (nods) that's the way of the world. the rich get richer and the days get shorter!  the conductor chuckles, sticks the ticket into the slot in the back of the seat facing williams, then continues out of the car.  33. close shot williams  as he leans back in the chair. his face looks tired and wan. he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.  (continued)  continued:  in his subconscious he heard the voice first of misrell and then other voices that spring up from his subconscious. over the tight, close shot of his face the voices come in filtered, discordantly loud, real and yet somehow a step beyond reality.  misrell's voice it's a push, push, push business, williams. it's an absolutely push, push, push business. it's a push, push, push business. you got to get with it, boy. it's a push, push, push business. you got to get with it, boy. it's a push, push, push business. you got to get with it, boy.  34. different tight angle williams's face as his eyes go open and he shouts out.  williams that's enough!  35. reverse angle looking over his shoulder at woman in front of him  who turns around, wide—eyed, and stares at him. 36. different angle williams  as he turns away from her to stare out the window of the train.  37. angle shot over his shoulder  at the wintry landscape outside in the darkness. his eyes close as he leans his head out the window and after a moment lets his head rest on the back of the seat, his eyes closed. the sound of the train comes up to provide a humming clickety clack sound as the camera moves in for an angle shot looking down from over the head of williams as he falls asleep. gradually the sound of the train takes on a different tone. it‘s imperceptible at first and then very obvious, almost as if the train were going through a tunnel and there was an echoy effect. lights shoot by playing on williams's face and on the interior of the train. the camera starts a slow pan down until it's directly in front of williams, shooting on him. then the camera pulls back to reveal an absolutely empty car and suddenly the entire car is suffused by sunlight and then the train is suddenly coming to a stop. dolly in for close shot of williams as his eyes open and suddenly blink. he takes a deep breath, looks at his watch, then looks out the window.  38. different angle williams's face  as he suddenly starts in amazement. slow pan shot up from him to a shot out the window. outside it is suddenly bright and sunny and obviously summer. the train has stopped in front of a small railroad station with a big sign which reads  \"willoughby.\"  39. close shot williams  as again he starts and stares.  40. long shot looking out the window  of the train station. there are horse-drawn carriages. women with parasols and long dresses. men in obvious nineteenth— century costume. little boys with knickers run back and forth. one carries a fishing pole.  41. different angle looking down the street  as seen from the train car. a bandstand, carriages, all the accoutrements to a quiet summer day of almost a century ago.  42. close shot williams  as his eyes scan the scene. he shakes his head in bewilderment, amazement.  43. different angle of him inside train  as he rises, walks halfway down the car, staring out of the windows as he walks.  44. long shot over his shoulder  as the far door of the car opens. a conductor comes in, this one in old—fashioned dress. he smiles at williams and calls out in a trainman's voice.  conductor.two willoughby. this stop is willoughbyl  he starts to walk past williams who grabs him.  williams what do you mean, willoughby? where's willoughby?  conductor two (grins and winks) willoughby? that's willoughby right outside.  (continued)  10. continued:  williams whirls around to stare out the window again, then turns toward the conductor.  williams wait a minute...wait a minute, what's going on? there‘s no place called willoughby on this line. and look at it outside. the sun is out. it's...it‘s summer.  conductor two (smiles) that's what she is, mid-julyl and a real warm one, too.  he starts to walk past and again williams has to grab him and stop him.  williams wait a minute...it's november. what's going on anyway? it's november! what is this place? where are we? what‘s happened?  45. different angle the conductor  as he releases himself and continues to walk down the car. 46. reverse angle looking over his shoulder  toward williams who stands there staring after him.  47. reverse angle looking toward confuctor williams's p.o.v.  williams please...please, what's going on? where is willoughby?  48. med. close shot the conductor  as he smiles again but this time with a touch of seriousness on his face and a kind of mysterious tilt of his head. he winks.  conductor two willoughby, sir? that's willoughby right outside. willoughby. july. summer. it's 1888. it‘s a lovely little village. (and then the smile fades and there's something intense in his voice) you ought to try it sometime! (more)  (continued)  11. continued:  conductor two (cont'd) peaceful, restful, where a man can slow down to a walk and live his life full  measure! (then he turns and calls out  again) willoughy. this stop is willoughby.  he continues out the opposite door.  49. different angle williams  as he races down the length of the car to follow the conductor. he yanks open the door.  cut to:  50. shot over his shoulder of the platform between cars  which is empty, and beyond it a window leading to the next car which is also empty of anyone.  51. close shot williams  as he turns around and is tight on camera. his face is twisted and torn with confusion. his mouth opens as if to protest or question or plead for someone to give him understanding and clarity. suddenly the train lurches and he falls against the side of the door, clutching it for support. then very slowly he turns and walks back to his seat.  52. track shot with him as he walks and sits down. he looks out of the window. 53. moving shot from inside the train  as the train moves and leaves the town and station behind. the camera dollies in for extremely tight close shot of williams as he stares out the window and then suddenly the light pattern changes. the interior lights of the train take over and it is now dark and wintry and there are other people in the car. the conductor that we've seen in the beginning comes by.  conductor one westport-saugatuck next stop. (he pauses by williams) have a good sleep, mr. williams?  williams (starts and looks up at him) yeah. (after a pause, quietly) yeah, i had a good sleep. (more)  (continued)  12. continued:  williams (cont ' d) a good sleep with an idiotic dream. idiotic. (he turns to stare out the window) at least...at least i guess it's idiotic. (then he turns to look up toward conductor) ever hear of a town named willoughby?  conductor one (screws up his face thoughtfully) willoughby? willoughby where?  williams willoughby, connecticut, i guess. or willoughby, new york.  conductor one (shakes his head thoughtfully) no, not on this run. (he moves)  there's no willoughby on the line. (then he continues on, yelling) westport-saugatuck next stop. westport-  saugatuck.  he disappears through the car door as the camera pans over to williams. he rises very slowly to his feet, picks up his briefcase, starts out the car as wedddissolve to:  54. ext. suburban ranch home [night] sprawling very pretentious looking modern home  dissolve to: 55. int. living room—den  williams stands by a small bar pouring himself a large highball. he stirs the ice and very reflectively takes a sip of it. he turns as the light from the hall outside is suddenly ushered into the room with the door opening.  56. med. close shot mirror behind the bar  framed there is the reflection of williams's wife, jane. she  stands there frozen in place in the doorway looking across at him, accusing. this is a beautiful woman. but beautiful like  alabaster — just as cold, just as brittle, just as lacking in emotion. she walks slowly across the room toward him.  13.  57. different angle the two of them  jane and what are your plans this evening? to get quietly plastered and then sing old college songs?  williams (smiles at her a little wanly) it's been one of those days—  jane i know all about it. bob blair's wife called me. she said he'd been in the meeting with you. you got...you got hysterical or something. she called to find out how you were.  58. med. close shot williams as he turns away, smiles.  williams  they were all very solicitous — all the boys at the meeting.  (he looks down into his glass  and jiggles the ice) that free-flowing compassion that is actually relief! i'm the victim - not them! they've mistaken an intake of breath for an outpouring of sympathy!  he starts to pour himself another drink. she crosses over and grabs his arm, looking straight into his face, her own face white and taut.  jane would you spare me your little homilies now and just give me a little simple and frank and honest answer. did you wreck a career this afternoon? did you throw away a job?  williams it appears not. mr. misrell phoned before i left the office. he has found it in that giant, oversized heart of his to forgive. this somewhat obese, gracious gentleman will allow me to continue in his employ simply because he's such a human—type fellah-  (a pause) (more)  (continued)  continued:  l4.  williams (cont'd) with a small, insignificant, parenthetic additional reason — that if i were to go to competitive agency, i might possibly take a lot of business with me!  jane g0 on.  williams  (shrugs) that's it. that's all of it.  (he carries his drink across  the room and sits down in a  chair) i'm tired, janie. i'm tired, and i’m sick.  jane  (from across the room) then you're in the right ward! we specialize in people who are sick and tired too, gart. i'm sick and tired of a husband who lives in a kind of permanent self-pity! a husband with a heart bleeding sensitivity he unfurls like a flag whenever he decides that the competition is too rough for him.  59. close shot williams  as his head goes up and he stares across the room at her.  williams  some people aren‘t built for competition, janie.  (he rises and walks halfway  over to her) or big pretentious houses that they can't afford. or rich communities they don't feel comfortable in. or country clubs that they wear around their necks like a badge of status—  jane (on her feet, shouts at him) and you would prefer-  williams (outshouting her now) i would prefer, though never asked before, a job, any job — any job at all where i could be myself! (more)  (continued)  15. continued:  williams (cont‘d)  where i wouldn't have to climb on a stage and go through a masquerade every morning at nine and mouth all the dialogue and play the executive and make believe i‘m the bright young man on his way up. because i'm not that person, janie. you've tried to make me that person, but that isn't me.  (now his voice is quieter as he  turns away from her) that isn't me at all. i‘m...i'm a not very young, soon to be old, very uncompetitive, rather dull, quite uninspired, average type of guy—  (he whirls around toward her) with a wife who has an appetite!  jane and where would you be if it weren't for my appetite?  60. close shot williams as his eyes drop. he walks over to the chair and sits down.  williams i know where i'd like to be.  jane (challenging, her voice brittle and shrill) and where would that be?  he looks up at her. the camera moves in very close to his face.  williams a place called willoughby. a little town that i chartered inside my head. a place i manufactured in a dream. (he looks away from her now, speaks softly and reflectively, almost as if to himself) an odd dream. a very odd dream. willoughby. it was summer. very warm. the kids were barefooted. one of them carried a fishing pole. and the main street looked like...looked like a currier and ives painting. bandstand, old-fashioned stores, bicycles, wagons. (he looks toward her again) i've never seen such a...such a serenity. (more)  (continued)  16. continued:  williams (cont'd) it was the way people must have lived a hundred years ago.

(a pause) it was like...a doorway that leads to sanity. a soundproof world where shouts and cries can‘t be heard.  65. close shot jane  jane (her words like pieces of ice)  nothing serious, gart. it's just that you were born too late. that's the problem. you were born too late. and your taste is a little cheap! you're the kind of man who could be satisfied with a summer afternoon and an ice wagon pulled by a horse. my mistake, pal. my error. my miserable tragic error.

(he waits impatiently, conscious of misrell staring at him)  misrell\\'s voice (from opposite side of room) williams, we\\'re still waiting for your mr. ross!  williams (with a forced smile, over his shoulder) ) i\\'m trying to get him now, sir. (then into phone) this jake ross\\'s secretary? joanie: where is he? i know he\\'s out to lunch. but there was a conference called here at two o\\'clock. it is now two—thirty, now where is he! (he wets his lips, forces his voice down an octave) all right, check around. (more)  (continued)  continued:  williams (cont\\'d) call sardi\\'s east or the colony and tell him to get his keister back here in a hurry!  he slams down the receiver then fixes his face into a smiling, nonchalant mask and returns to the table.  5. track shot with him  as he walks over to the table, sits down, again smiling toward mr. misrell.  6. close shot misrell who stares back at him, totally unsmiling.  misrell well? where is your protege with the three-million—dollar automobile account?  williams he‘s due at any moment, sir. probably a big lunch crowd or something—  misrell don\\'t be an idiot. more likely a big martini, or three or four of \\'em. he was too young to put on this account — i told you that, williams. he\\'s much too young to put on this large and important an account-  there\\'s a knock on the door.  7. moving shot with williams  as he springs to his feet and hurries over to the big, double conference room doors. he opens it up. a young secretary hands him an envelope which he literally pulls out of her hand, slams the door behind him, rips open the envelope, and starts to read.  8. extremely tight close shot williams‘ face  as suddenly he looks white, stares up over the letter briefly toward misrell.  9. close shot misrell  reacting.  10. close shot williams  as his eyes slowly go downward and the letter in his hand drops to his side. he carries it very slowly over to the table and stands there at the far end.  11. reverse angle looking over his shoulder  down the length of the table at misrell who very slowly drums on the table in a methodical, tapping that permeates the silence of the room.  misrell well? we have now been here thirty-four minutes, mr. williams.  williams (looks up from the letter, takes a deep breath) this is a communication from jake ross.  misrell would you be so kind as to share its contents with us?  12. med. close shot williams  as he looks down at the letter, spreads it out on the top of the table, then looks up from it.  williams i can tell you the sense of it very quickly, mr. misrell. this is jake ross\\'s resignation. he\\'s moving over to another agency.  13. close shot misrell as his face seems to freeze.  misrell and?  14. close shot williams as his face seems to freeze. williams  and he\\'s taking the automobile account with him.  15. pan shot down the faces of the men  at the table as each seems to catch his breath and then look from misrell and with great compassion and concern over toward williams.  misrell did you hear what i said, williams? that account represented a gross billing of something in the neighborhood of three million dollars a year. and how many times have you promised it to me?  williams (clears his throat and for a moment can\\'t get a word out) this is as much of a shock to me as it is to you, mr. misrell.  misrell (roaring) don\\'t con me, williams! it was your pet project! your pet project: then it was your idea to give it to that little college greeny! now get with it, williams. get with it, boy!  he rises from his seat and goes to the window, his jowled, fleshy face screwed up like a little baby about to cry; now he whirls around toward williams, points a finger at him.  misrell (cont \\' d) so what\\'s left, williams?

(he shakes his head) don\\'t ask me how we got that boy. or to explain why he is the wgy he is. he just got born one june six years ago and old doc baker - god rest him — took a look at him, screamed, dropped him and tried to kill him. anthony, my...my sgg had whined then let out a cry...and then...then he done this thing.  (he looks away for a  moment) it\\'s hard to explain. real hard to explain what this thing is, but...but it appears that anthony destroyed the world and left only this village in it or he\\'d taken the village someplace away from everything. we don\\'t know exactly which. all we do know is that we\\'re alone and there aren\\'t any towns or villages or anything else left except this place. and anthony...he controls it with his mind. he controls everything. that\\'s right that...that little six— year—old boy on the porch over there. he can send people into a grave. or he can turn them into a walking horror...anything he wants.  (then very thoughtfully) that\\'s right. anything he wants. he just turns his mind against you and...  (he makes a tired  gesture of resignation  and accustomed horror) so that\\'s why when you walk down the street of the village or go past the house or any place...simply any place where anthony might be...you got to keep smiling or laughing or you got to mumble something to keep your mind clear. because anthony...ahthony can tell what you\\'re thinkin\\', and if it\\'s a bad thought...if it\\'s a bad thought...  (more)  dad fremont (cont\\'d)  (the camera moves in  for a much tighter  shot of dad fremont  as the face is  suddenly a sunburned  mask of bare,  unadulterated naked  fear) anthony\\'s mind will snap at you and he‘ll do most anything. most anything at all.  cut to:  4. long shot looking toward farmhouse where aunt amy rocks on the porch and the little boy sits a few feet away on the steps.  dad\\'s voice like with aunt amy sittin‘ on the porch there. she had more control over anthony than almost anybody. certainly more than me and his mother, but one day last winter she got angry at him and for just one instant...that\\'s all it took...just one instant...she forgot what he could do and she yelled at him.  cut to:  5. closer angle aunt amy who sits there rocking with dull lusterless, almost insane eyes.  dad\\'s voice (cont\\'d) so anthony...anthony...he just looked up at her and he...he turned her into what she is now. just a smiling, vacant thing. and she was so pretty once, too, and so bright. but when anthony\\'s mind snapped at her - that was the end of aunt amy\\'s bright eyes, and it was the end of amy fremont as everyone had known her.  cut to:  6. different shot bill soames as he pedals up to the front porch and gets off the bike.  dad\\'s voice (cont\\'d) and that‘s why...that\\'s why everyone smiles around anthony now. because you can\\'t take the risk of making the little boy angry. you just can\\'t take that risk...  ‘2.  7. moving shot bill soames carrying the groceries toward the house. we see in his face a nightmarish fear that is beyond the telling. he forces a smile that is grotesque in every aspect as he walks over toward the little boy.  bill howdy, anthony. mighty good to see you today. mighty good. and it\\'s such a good day. a real good day, isn\\'t it, anthony?  8. close shot little boy  the first close shot we\\'ve had of him. on the surface it is a little boy\\'s face, smudged with dirt, bright—eyed and not unattractive. but looking at it deeper we see that it is not really a normal face at all. perhaps it\\'s in the eyes or in the look, but whatever it is, the eyes tell that this is a  monster. he looks up at bill soames and nods. pan over to  aunt amy as she slowly turns her vacant eyes over to soames.  aunt amy (fanning herself) it‘s a terrible hot day, though. it\\'s a terrible hot day.  9. close shot bill who looks agonized at her.  bill  ((he almost cringes  when he speaks) oh, i wouldn\\'t say that...aunt amy. no, sir, i wouldn\\'t say that at all.  (with a sidelook at  anthony) it\\'s fine. it\\'s just fine. it\\'s a real good day.  10. different angle of him as he starts to carry the groceries up the steps, stops, looks off at something a few feet away, cringes, shakes, turns his head away.  bill (cont\\'d) what you doin\\', anthony? my, that\\'s  real good...whatever it is...i was just wonderin\\' what you were doin\\'.  11. close shot anthony anthony i made a gopher with three heads. see him?  12. angle shot looking up toward bill\\'s face  as his eyes look glazed.  bill yeah. yeah...he\\'s a real fine one. i ain‘t never seen a gopher with three  heads. cut to: 13. close shot anthony anthony i\\'ll make him dead now. i\\'m tired of playing with him. be dead. gopher, you be dead. cut to:  14. close shot bill\\'s face  bill now that\\'s real fine, anthony. that‘s real fine what you done. you made him dead. that\\'s good that you done that. that\\'s real good.  aunt amy rises and looks over the railing and makes a face.  aunt amy ain\\'t he an ugly thing, though. ain\\'t he... (searching for a word) ain\\'t he grotesque looking. you better bury him, anthony.  anthony i\\'ll wish him into the corn field. (he rises, looks down at something close to his feet) go into the corn field. go be in the corn field.  cut to:  16. close shot portion of ground where obviously a living, digging creature had been.  17. close shot anthony as he turns back toward bill.  anthony (cont\\'d) you don\\'t want me to wish you dead, do you?  bill (gulps, his face turns white) why...why no, anthony. no, i don\\'t. but...but you do some real fine things. real fine. you‘re a...you‘re (more)  bill (cont\\'d) a good boy. anthony. we all love you. don\\'t we, aunt amy? don\\'t we love anthony? we sure do love him. we love that boy.  the camera moves in tight on his face as tears appear in his eyes, and in just one brief, sporadic moment a sob tears itself away from his throat. he whirls around and carries a bag of groceries into the house. the camera starts a slow pan back away from the old woman, down to where anthony sits and stares out across at the field.  serling\\'s voice in just a moment we\\'ll get even a closer look at anthony fremont and the people of the village and the village itself. peaksville, ohio, in a world in which nothing exists excegt peaksville. a world that anthony fremont manufactured. a nightmare that lies at the center of...the twilight zone.  fade to black--opening billboard--first commercial--fade on: 18. int. farm kitchen fremont house [day]  anthony’s mother is just checking a roast in the oven as bill soames brings in the grocery bag.  mrs. fremont (smiles at him) howdy, bill. got everything?  bill pretty much, mrs. fremont. (he checks a list) didn\\'t have any more laundry soap, though. all out of laundry soap.  mrs. fremont well, that‘s to be expected. not even the bar soap though. huh? all out of that too?  bill oh, we been out of that for a year, you know that mrs. fremont. we ain\\'t had no bar soap for over a year. but i got a couple of cans of soup in there. didn\\'t even know we had them left. and anthony loves tomato soup, don\\'t he? so i brought that.

(he smiles happily.  then the smile fades) he shouldn\\'t have thought those bad thoughts. that‘s why i did that to him.  again the dog barks from outside. the camera moves in for an extremely close shot of anthony who turns and walks over to the window.  anthony (cont\\'d) that dog...that collie dog...he doesn‘t like me. he\\'s a bad dog.  at this moment something happens to the child\\'s eyes. they seem to burn fiercely. there\\'s a piercing, screaming yelp of pain from the animal outside that fades off in a dissonant dying whisper and then there is silence.  32. moving shot dad fremont as he walks to his son\\'s side.  dad fremont well now, anthony...did you do something to bill soames\\'s dog? did you?  as his eyes traverse the yard outside he suddenly stops, closes them and almost shakes. then his lips tremble and he tries to form words and finally words come out.  .l‘2-  dad fremont (cont\\'d)  why...why, isn\\'t that a good thing what you done, anthony. a real good thing. but it would be another good thing if you...if you...  (he closes his eyes  again and the voice  comes out as a kind  of hoarse whisper) if you wished what was left of him into the corn field. it\\'s a good thing what you did to him but...but...  the camera moves over to anthony, who nods, concentrates, then looks back at his father.  anthony i put him in the corn field. he isn\\'t outside anymore.  33. different angle anthony as he turns and walks across the room and out. pan back over for a medium close shot of dad fremont as he stands at the window, his head down, fingers clenching and unclenching. footsteps approach and mrs. fremont enters the room.  34. close shot mrs. fremont her face is white and stricken.  mrs. fremont bill soames‘s collie was out in the yard. i heard him barking and then he screamed. i didn\\'t see it happen, but aunt amy said it looked like somebody had taken a torch and—  she stops abruptly and looks down at the floor. 35. two shot  dad fremont (smiles, nods, chuckles and it all comes out like some kind of maniacal masquerade) why, anthony done that. it was a real good thing that anthony done it wasn\\'t it honey? wasn\\'t it a real good thing?  mrs. fremont (hurriedly, looking around) oh yes. yes, indeed. it was a real good thing that anthony done that. well i‘ve got to get back and get supper ready. ethel\\'s bringing over a cake for dan. she found the last box of cane sugar that there was to be found. the very last box. and dan (more)  her voice who turns  j.j-  mrs. fremont (cont\\'d) hasn\\'t got one single inkling that there\\'s a surprise party for him. not one.  dad fremont (staring out the window, softly) that\\'s good. that\\'s real good.  mrs. fremont and you know how much dan likes music. well, last week thelma dunn found a record in her attic.  dad fremont that a fact!  mrs. fremont yes! and she\\'s going to give it to him tonight, isn\\'t that a wonderful surprise?

wasn\\'t anthony\\'s television wonderful tonight?  there\\'s a chorus of forced approval that comes from tight, grim mouths.  thelma it was much better than the old television.  the chorus of voices goes up in assent with sentence fragments like, \"\"oh, it certainly was.\"\" \"\"much, much better.\"\" \"\"it was the best yet.\"\"  mrs. fremont (rises from the couch) and now the big surprise for dan\\'s birthday. go ahead, ethel. give your hubby the big surprise.  ethel goes over to a spot behind the sofa and takes a circular wrapped package. she hands it to hollis. he looks at it grinning.  hollis  what\\'s this?

(he slowly opens the  package and removes  the phonograph record.  he holds it up) perry como.  (his eyes mist) why, i haven\\'t heard perry como in years and years.  his wife hugs him.  ethel happy birthday, darling. happy birthday.  hollis  (laughs, pulling his  wife\\'s arm off of  him) hey, you better be careful. i\\'m holding a priceless object.  (he looks down at the  record again) look...do you think we could play it? gosh what i\\'d give to hear some new music...just the first part, the orchestra part, before como sings?  j_u.  there\\'s a sober silence as everyone stares at him and then looks away.  dad fremont i don‘t think we‘d better, dan. after all, we don\\'t know just where the singer comes in. it would be taking too much of a chance. better wait till you get home.  39. different angle hollis as he reluctantly puts the record down on the table.  hollis (automatically) it‘s good that i can\\'t play it here.  thelma oh yes, it‘s good. it\\'s really good.  mrs. fremdnt now i think it‘s time for pat riley to play some piano for us. how about it, pat?  riley (a youngish farmer laughs) my pleasure.  he walks over to the piano, sits down and starts to play, suddenly conscious that anthony is standing close to him, watching him.  40. close shot his fingers on the keys pan up to  angle shot:  his face as the features twist. he forces a smile and hits a flat note. then he whirls around hurriedly to anthony.  riley (cont\\'d) it would be good if you told me what to play, anthony. it would be real good if you tell me what music you  like. anthony just play. play anything. riley (forces the smile  again) all right. all right. i\\'ll play...i\\'il play \"\"night and day.\"\" that‘s a nice old tune.  j.)-  the people converge around the piano. there\\'s a chorus of voices, \"\"yes, that\\'s a good tune.\"\" \"\"it\\'s good that you\\'re going to play that.\"\" \"\"oh, that\\'s lovely tune.\"\"  41. full shot the room as riley continues to play, camera pans over for a shot of dan hollis, who\\'s drinking the brandy in long, thirsty gulps. every now and then he looks over at the record that he\\'s placed on the table and once he reaches over to touch it in almost a caress.  42. close shot dad fremont watching hollis.  43. close shot ethel his wile, as she too, with nervous fingers in her mouth, watches her husband drink.  44. close shot hollis as once again he puts the bottle to  his mouth, takes another long, long swig, then puts the bottle down, and in doing so upsets a cup. the noise of it is a shattering intrusion on the music and all eyes turn toward him. the last face to turn in his direction is that of anthony.  45. mad. close shot anthony who surveys the man coldly.  anthony don\\'t make any noise when the music is playing. i don\\'t like noise when the music is playing.  46. close shot hollis as he blinks back the enveloping pressure of the alcohol, tosses a salute, smiles and reaches down for the bottle again.  47. close shot dad fremont who slowly turns back toward the piano, but in doing so throws a look at anthony, then over to his wile who stands there, hands clenched together in front of her as riley continues to play.  48. close shot hollis as he takes another drink, giggles a little bit, then looks down at his wife who has crossed over to stand close to him. her face is a mask of fear.  etbel (in a whisper) dan...dan please...  hollis please what? i\\'m not doing anything. i\\'m just drinking this peach brandy. i\\'m just drinking one of my birthday presents. that\\'s all i\\'m doing.  there\\'s a rustle and murmur in the room as eyes move from hollis to anthony, eyes that betray the cold, clammy nightmare that enfolds all of them.  49. two shot ethel and hollis again as she grabs the front of his coat.  (1u.  ethel (in an anguished whisper) please, dan. for the love of heaven...please don‘t say anything.  hollis (now past the point of realization, takes another drink) who\\'s saying anything? i\\'m not saying anything. i\\'m not saying anything at all.  50. pan shot around the faces of the people  winding up on a shot of dad fremont who touches pat riley\\'s arm.  dad fremont go ahead, pat. play. keep playing.  51. different angle hollis as he moves away from his wife and carries the bottle to the center of the room. he looks over toward the piano.  hollis this is real good brandy. real good. do you people know something? there’s only five bottles of real whiskey left in the whole village. only five bottles. one rye, two scotch, one after-dinner liqueur, and this here. and when all that\\'s gone — there won\\'t be any left at all. none at all.  (he grins drunkenly)  no whiskey at all.  he stumbles as he turns and goes back over to the table where the record is. he picks it up and stares at it.  hollis (cont\\'d) nuts. (then shouting it suddenly) nuts. can\\'t even play my record. can\\'t even play perry como.  he suddenly takes the nearly empty bottle and throws it across the room where it smashes against the wall.  52-55. series of close—ups of the people in the room as each look reflects their own personal horror.  56. different angle hollis as he walks over to pat riley at the piano, puts his hand on his shoulder.  4.].-  hollis (cont\\'d) don\\'t play that, pat. that\\'s not what i want you to play. play this. (he then sings in a discordant, off-key drunken voice) happy birthday to me...happy birthday to me...  eteel (screaming) dan!  57. moving shot with her  as she runs over to him and tries to grab his arm. she screams again.  ethel (cont‘d) please stop-  58. close shot thelma dunn who half—whispers, half—shouts.  thelma quiet...oh please. ethel...be quiet—  59. different angle the room as two of them grab ethel and pull her away. one of them covers her mouth with his hand.  60. close shot hollis as he continues to sing.  hollis  happy birthday, dear danny, happy birthday to me.  (he stops abruptly  and looks down at  riley) play it, pat. play it so i can sing right. you know i can\\'t carry a tune unless somebody plays it.  61. angle shot looking up at pat riley his face sweaty and white, his hands shaking on the keys as he starts to play something like \"\"lover\"\" in a slow waltz tempo, but his hands fumbling so badly over the keys that every other note is flat and wrong.  62. extremely tight close shot hollis  as he turns very slowly away from the piano bench. he stares across the room at dad fremont and mrs. fremont, who stands close by. he suddenly whirls around and slams his own hand  on the keyboard, stopping all sound in one burst of discordant chord. then he straightens up and looks again toward the fremonts.  ll-  hollis (cont\\'d)  you! you and her!  (tears gleam on his  cheeks, caught by  the candlelight in  the room) you had him. you had to go have him.  (he shuts his eyes  tightly and squeezes  the tears out. then  he suddenly throws  back his head and  sings again) \"\"you are my sunshine...my only sunshine...you make me happy...when i am blue...\"\"  63. close shot eteel struggling in the embrace of the two men who hold her.  64. close shot hollis as he stops singing, looks down at the floor then looks up, a very slow pan over to the other end of the room where anthony stands there watching him, his cold eyes surveying him, the little face a mask.  hollis (cont\\'d)  you monster you. you dirty little monster. you murderer.  (he takes a step toward  the boy) you go ahead, anthony. you think about me. you think bad thoughts about me and maybe some man in this room, some man with guts, somebody who\\'s so sick to death of living in this kind of place and is willing to take a chance...will sneak up behind you and lay something across your skull and end this once and for all—  65. close shot anthony as his eyes widen.  anthony you\\'re a bad man. you\\'re a very bad man.  66. reverse angle looking toward hollis who stands there, half—swaying with the alcohol.  hollis you think that, anthony. you go ahead. i\\'m a very bad man. keep thinking that.  (more)  hollis (cont\\'d) (then turning this way and that way} somebody get behind him. somebody end this now. while he\\'s thinking about me — why doesn\\'t somebody take a lamp or a bottle or something and—  cut to:  67. close shot anthony as he slowly raises his arm and points to hollis.  anthony you\\'re a very bad man. and you keep thinking bad thoughts about me.  68. closer, tighter angle on anthony as he eyes suddenly burn bright and fierce.  cut to:  69—72. several extremely tight tilt close shots of the faces of the people  as their eyes widen. the women scream. the men turn their heads away. the last close-up is that of ethel who suddenly breaks away from the two men holding her and lets out one long, vast shriek.  cut to:  73. angle shot of the floor where the shadow of what dan hollis is now plays on the wall. it is a wiggly, cobralike thing which coils and uncoils. dad fremont takes a step toward his son.  dad fremont anthony, wish it away. wish it into the corn field. please, son. wish it into the corn field-  74. close shot anthony who nods. looks down again, concentrating.  cut to:  75. shadow on the wall as it disappears. in its aftermath there is absolute dead silence.  76. close shot anthony  anthony he was a bad man, so i turned him into a snake. a snake that still had his bad face.  l‘i-  he turns toward ethel who looks at him with an expression that cannot be described, half horror, half fear, half a burgeoning hate.  anthony (cont\\'d) you mustn\\'t think bad thoughts either or i\\'ll do the same thing to you. (he slowly turns toward pat riley) play some more music.  77. close shot dad fremont  dad fremont it\\'s a...it\\'s a good thing that you did that to dan. it\\'s a very good thing.  78. close shot pat riley who once again begins to play \"\"night and day\"\" on the piano, tears rolling down his face.  riley oh yes, it was swell. just swell. a real good thing.  79. different angle anthony as he climbs up on top of the piano and sits there quietly with his hands in his lap.  80. close shot aunt amy who sighs, looks at the piano, then the television set.  aunt amy (softly, with a sigh) i kind of liked it a little bit better when there were cities outside and we could get real television and things like that.  mrs. fremont why, amy - it\\'s good for you to say such a thing. very good. but how can you mean it? why, anthony\\'s television is much better than anything we ever used to get.  81. close shot dad fremont  dad fremont oh yes. it\\'s fine. anthony\\'s are the best shows we\\'ve ever seen.  again the chorus of assent, hopeful voices in total agreement and gargoyle smiles. the camera pans over to the window where suddenly we begin to see heavy drops of snow.  l4.  dad fremont (cont\\'d) it\\'s snowing outside. anthony, are you making it snow?  82. close shot anthony who nods.  anthony yes. i\\'m making it snow.  83. close shot dad fremont who smiles.  dad fremont  that\\'ll kill off half the crops. that\\'s what that\\'ll do, anthony.  (then his lips tremble) but it\\'s good that you\\'re making it snow. it\\'s real good. and tomorrow...tomorrow will be a good day!  84. close shot anthony again on the piano as he looks down  at pat riley playing. the camera starts to pull away from  the piano across the room toward the window. we hear serling\\'s voice.  serling\\'s voice no comment here. no comment at all. we only wanted to introduce you to one of our very special citizens — little anthony fremont, age six, who lives in a village called peaksville in a place that used to be ohio. and if by some strange chance you should run across him...you had best think only good thoughts. anything less than that is handled at your own risk. because if you do meet anthony...you can be sure of one thing. you have entered...the twilight zone.  fade to black.  \"\\r\\n2|Twilight Zone|Nick of Time|November 13, 1959|\"the twilight zone \"\"the nick of time\"\" written by richard matheson  \\x0cact one int. main street - ridgeview, ohio - day fade in and pan down from a sunny sky to a young married couple, don and pat carter, who look a little bored. they ride in a convertible that\\'s being towed through the streets of a small town. pat shakes her head in disbelief that this happening. the tow truck pulls into a garage and parks. don, glances at pat, gets out of the driver\\'s seat, stretches his stiff back, looks around at the little town -- which is dullsville. he crosses to the mechanic who has just emerged from the truck. don (to the mechanic) how long is this gonna take? mechanic like i told you, nobody stocks fuel pumps around town. i\\'ll have to send in to dayton for it. don how long will that take? mechanic (unhooking the car) oh, three, four hours. better figure on four to play safe. a disappointed don leaves the mechanic and helps pat out of the car. pat (to don) four hours? crazy. don let\\'s get some lunch. pat lunch? we can homestead. they start walking down the sidewalk hand in hand, searching for a place  \\x0cto eat. don and pat are in their twenties -- casually dressed, a nice-looking couple. pat (playfully) june, prune, honeymoon. don (smiling) quiet. pat (mocking him) quiet. don don\\'t think i should phone the office again, huh? pat you are going to lose that promotion if you keep pestering them, lover. don i\\'m gonna lose it anyway. pat ah, that\\'s a fine way to talk. and i thought i married a man with confidence. and who is the best man for the job? don me. but... pat but? don but thompson has seniority. pat ah. doesn\\'t mean a thing. don little miss sunshine, hm?  \\x0cpat (all smiles) that\\'s me. he gives her a kiss on the cheek. they approach a lamp post. for a moment, it looks as if they will pass it on opposite sides, but don grabs pat\\'s hand and pulls her around to his side of the post, to avoid getting \"\"bad luck.\"\" don bread and butter. pat (gently mocking him) yes, dear. don just trying to save your life. they step off the curb and cross the street. pat points out a diner and the couple hurries to it. dissolve to: int. diner - day moments later, don and pat enter a little diner called the \"\"busy bee cafe.\"\" shrimp: 85 cents. bacon, eggs and hot cakes: 70 cents. don gestures that they could sit at the diner\\'s counter. don shall we? but pat wants to put some money in the jukebox first. pat let\\'s have some music, shall we? don great. they cross to the jukebox. pat deposits her coin and makes a selection while don kisses the back of her neck. the music begins, a romantic tune. don takes pat in his arms and they dance. a slow dance. cheek to cheek. they are very much in love.  \\x0cpat i thought we came in here to eat. don guess we did. don looks back at the counter, but sees that they have danced over to an empty table. don (gestures to the table) shall we sit here? as they sit side by side, don\\'s attention is immediately drawn to the table\\'s odd napkin holder, which doubles as a penny fortune machine: insert a penny, ask a \"\"yes-or-no\"\" question, pull a lever, and the machine dispenses a small card with an answer to the question. sort of a 1960 version of the magic 8-ball. every table in the diner has one of these machines whose brand name is \"\"mystic seer\"\". atop each machine is the bobbing, plastic head of a horned devil, its face winking and grinning mischievously. don well, what have we got here? the mystic seer. pat the what? let\\'s try it, shall we? don have you got a penny, honey? pat i think so. don what\\'ll we ask it? pat i don\\'t know. don i got it.  \\x0cpat what? don deposits a penny. don (to the seer) does anything exciting ever happen around here? he pulls the lever and a card pops out. smiling at pat, don reads the card in his hand. don (reads aloud) \"\"it is quite possible.\"\" narrator (v.o.) the hand belongs to mr. don s. carter, male member of a honeymoon team en route across the ohio countryside to new york city. fast pan to a table opposite, where the omniscient narrator sits, gently touching the devil\\'s head on another mystic seer. he wears a dark business suit, carries a lit cigarette, and speaks directly to the audience. narrator in one moment, they will be subjected to a gift most humans never receive in a lifetime. for one penny, they will be able to look into the future. the time is now, the place is a little diner in ridgeview, ohio, and what this young couple doesn\\'t realize is that this town happens to lie on the outskirts of the twilight zone. fade out int. diner - day fade in on don and pat seated at the table, studying a menu. the diner\\'s weird old counterman sets a couple of glasses of water in front of them.  \\x0ccounterman howdy. pat hello. don hi. counterman what\\'ll it be? pat i think i\\'ll have a tomato and lettuce on whole wheat and some iced coffee, please. don i\\'ll have the same. counterman i\\'ve got some very good chicken-fried steak out there. don no, thank you. counterman no? don no. counterman (nods, off the menu) uh, you finished with that? don yes. the counterman takes the menu and departs. off the counterman, don and pat exchange glances. don takes a sip of his water and winces. don (off the water) ohh.  \\x0cpat good, hm? don great. he must\\'ve siphoned it out of a swamp. as pat digs through her purse for some make-up, don empties his pockets, putting his key ring and some coins on the table. pat what are you doing? don getting some pennies. pat (off the seer) what\\'re you gonna ask it now? don what else? as pat applies her make-up, don puts a finger under the devil\\'s chin, turns its head toward him, causing it to bob. don (to the seer) am i gonna be promoted, for pete\\'s sake? he deposits a penny, pulls the lever, takes the card, and reads it. don hey. (to pat) look. pat what? he shows her the card.  \\x0cdon (reads aloud) \"\"it has been decided in your favor.\"\" pat ah. you see? your worries are over. don looks around and sees a pay phone. don i think i\\'ll phone. pat honey! don well, i was gonna anyway. wasn\\'t i? they both grin. don picks up his spare change, crosses the pay phone, inserts a coin, and dials the operator. continues to smile at don\\'s behavior. she picks up his ring from the table and looks at the rabbit\\'s foot and leaf clover on it.  to pat key four  don (into the phone) hello, operator? give me maine one-eightnine-nine-seven in st. louis, please. that\\'s right. how much? seventy-five cents? (to pat) honey, you got another quarter on you? she nods, smiles, digs in her pocketbook for her change purse and brings him the money. pat (teasing him) is this call necessary? don (into the phone) here you are, operator. he deposits the necessary amount. a moment of tension follows, and then:  \\x0cdon (into the phone) hello? connect me with mr. weldon\\'s secretary, please. (to pat) keep your fingers crossed. pat (points to her head) i\\'m doing it up here. don (into the phone) hello? hello, pauline? it\\'s don. fine. fine. and you? (getting to the point) what\\'s the secret word, pauline? i did? (to pat, as he hugs her) i made it. (into the phone) thank you, pauline. yes, we\\'ll send you a post card from new york. as soon as we arrive. bye-bye. same to you. goodbye. (hangs up, to pat) i made it. pat darling, i\\'m so proud of you. they hug, return to the table, and sit. don you\\'re now looking at the world\\'s youngest office manager. pat and, i\\'m happy to say, i told you so. don (off the seer) so did he. pat yeah? well, i told you first. i think we ought to celebrate. (dips into her change purse) (more)  \\x0cpat (cont\\'d) here\\'s a dime for the jukebox. she hands don the dime. don some success music. don rises and goes to the jukebox. pat or the \"\"triumphal march\"\". don don\\'t know whether i can find it here. he selects a jaunty, generic version of \"\"american patrol\"\" and, doing a goofy little strut in time to the music, rejoins pat at the table. pat crazy. the counterman arrives with their sandwiches. don (to the counterman) oh. thank you. counterman you ain\\'t gonna like this as much as you would that chicken fried steak. don (affably) we\\'ll bear up. the counterman shrugs and departs. don and pat are about to dig in. pat hands don a napkin. pat ah, office manager. i think it\\'s wonderful. don (off the seer) let\\'s ask him something else. (more)  \\x0cdon (cont\\'d) he really came through on that one. pat (off her sandwich) hmmm... why don\\'t you ask him why he didn\\'t warn us the whole wheat bread is stale? printed on the front of the mystic seer are some suggested questions which don now studies. don (reads aloud) \"\"does he/she love me?\"\" (kisses pat\\'s cheek) i know the answer to that one, hm? (reads aloud) \"\"will i become rich?\"\" (to pat) i know the answer to that one, too. i\\'m gonna be the world\\'s first millionaire accountant. pat (corrects him) office manager. don right. (to the seer) is it really gonna be four hours before we get out of here? don deposits a penny, pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"you may never know.\"\" (to pat) what does that mean? pat who knows?  \\x0cdon (off the seer) he does. the devil\\'s head seems to be grinning right at don. pat um hmm. but it\\'ll cost you another penny. don snaps his fingers, a gesture of unconcern. don i\\'m an officer manager now. he deposits a penny. don (to the seer) what do you mean, we may never know? no, that\\'s not a yes-or-no question. you mean, something will keep us from knowing? something will happen to us? don pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"if you move soon.\"\" (laughs quietly, to pat) what does that mean? pat well, he\\'s a mystic. what do you expect? don starts to deposit another penny. pat i can see i\\'m going to have to be the frugal one in our family. don (to pat) just one more. (to the seer) you mean that we\\'re not supposed to move? we\\'re supposed to stay here?  \\x0cpat (imitates a phone operator) just one question per penny, please. but don is taking this seriously. a little too seriously for pat who grows visibly uncomfortable over the next few minutes. don deposits a penny, pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"that makes a good deal of sense.\"\" (to the seer) how long sh-- no, uh... don checks his watch. it\\'s almost 2:15. don (to the seer) should we stay here until two-thirty? don deposits a penny, pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"try again.\"\" don deposits a penny. don (to the seer) should we stay in here until three o\\'clock? don pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"there\\'s no question about it.\"\" pat doesn\\'t like where this is leading. pat don. let\\'s take a look around the town, hm? don every answer seems to fit.  \\x0cpat you\\'re joking, aren\\'t you? i mean -don starts to deposit another penny, but pat stops him. pat don, no more. but don gives her a look and deposits the penny anyway. don (to the seer) if we don\\'t stay in here until three o\\'clock... something bad will happen to us? don pulls the lever, takes the card, and reads it to himself. pat oh, don, for heaven\\'s sakes. don (hands pat the card) read it. pat (reads aloud) \"\"do you dare risk finding out?\"\" (to don) don, let\\'s go. but, clearly, don does not want to leave. he quickly turns to his lunch. don i haven\\'t finished my sandwich yet. (starts to eat) don\\'t you want some ice cream? an awkward silence follows. don checks his watch. it\\'s still a little before 2:15. dissolve to: int. diner - day the diner\\'s clock now reads four minutes to three. pat buys a pack of cigarettes from the diner\\'s vending machine. she  \\x0csmiles weakly at the counterman who seems to be wondering why she and don are loitering. in fact, she seems to be wondering the same thing herself. she crosses to don at the booth as he dawdles over a half-finished bowl of ice cream. pat (to don) can we go now? don don\\'t you want something cold to drink? pat please, let\\'s go. don looks first at the clock and then at the devil\\'s head, winking and grinning at him. don (to pat) all right. don kisses the rabbit\\'s foot on his key ring as he rises and goes to the counter. don (to the counterman) say, can i have my check? counterman you don\\'t need a check, i know what you had. two sandwiches, eighty cents. iced coffee, a dollar ten. two ice creams, a dollar sixty. with three cents tax. don (hands over some bills) here, keep the change. counterman thanks! and come on back now. don joins pat at the door. they exit the diner. cut to:  \\x0cext. street - day moments later, don and pat cross the street, walking hand in hand. don wipes his brow. pat hot, hot, hot. don yeah. pat maybe it won\\'t take them four hours to fix the car, think? don maybe. pat don, you didn\\'t really want to stay in there, did you? don (unconvincingly) no. pat honest? don well, why was it so specific? pat specific? sweetie... they both stop, having crossed the street. don \"\"if you move soon.\"\" \"\"that makes a good deal of sense.\"\" \"\"try again.\"\" \"\"there\\'s no question about it.\"\" \"\"you may never know.\"\" \"\"do you dare risk finding out?\"\" pat don, it\\'s just a napkin holder in a little cafe in ridgeview, ohio.  \\x0cdon oh, i know. i know... all right. what about my promotion, then? didn\\'t it tell me \"\"it has been decided in your favor\"\"? isn\\'t that...? oh, forget it. i suppose i\\'m just being stupid. pat no, you\\'re not. you\\'re just-don don\\'t say it. superstitious. it\\'s like you married an alcoholic, isn\\'t it? only instead of bottles in the chandelier, it\\'s rabbit\\'s feet and four leaf clovers in my pockets, in the car... pat and.. and you\\'re all mine. pat gives him a kiss. he puts his arm around her and again they stroll down the sidewalk hand in hand. for a moment, everything seems back to normal. until don looks around nervously. pat what are you doing? don what? pat well, you keep looking around as if-don do i? pat you are worried. you\\'re worried about that -- oh, don, i-i wonder when you act like this. don i\\'m sorry. i\\'m not trying to upset you.  \\x0cpat i know you\\'re not. don doesn\\'t change the facts, though. pat what facts? don six straight answers. pat oh, don, please. don oh, stop treating me like a retarded child or something. i didn\\'t make those answers up. a large truck is rolling slowly down the next street as don and pat step off the curb to cross. don pulls pat into the street figuring they can easily get across. pat oh, don, wait. don we can make it. but a speeding car suddenly passes the truck and nearly runs the couple down. don pulls pat to safety at the last moment. they fall against a parked car. on the sidewalk, townspeople murmur about the near accident. shaken, a relieved don and pat hug one another as don looks at the large clock over the main street jewelers: it\\'s exactly three. dissolve to: ext. street - day don and pat regroup on a nearby park bench, moments later. don you all right? quite a moment.  \\x0cpat if you hadn\\'t pulled me out of the way of that car -- one squashed honeymoon. don come on. they rise and don leads her by the hand down the street. pat well, where\\'re we going now? pat freezes when she sees they are heading back to the diner. pat we\\'re not going back to that-don why not? pat all right. i admit it was a... strange coincidence. don if it was a coincidence, well, what are you worrying about us going back, then? pat i\\'m not. don so, stop worrying. just the same, you will admit that for a coincidence it was pretty far-fetched? pat maybe. the honeymoon couple walk toward the diner, no longer hand in hand. fade out end of act one  \\x0cact two int. diner - day don and pat enter and head toward the table with the seer on it -- but stop dead in their tracks at the sight of something before them. pat seems quietly pleased but don looks pretty grim. two little old ladies sit at the table sipping sodas. pat (ironic, to don) well! someone\\'s sitting in front of our mystic seer. don\\'s in no mood for irony. pat turns and walks over to the counter. she looks up to see that don still stares at the little old ladies. pat don? a frustrated don turns to her stiffly. pat why don\\'t you try this one? or one of the others? i\\'m sure that-don joins her at the counter but keeps his eyes on the little old ladies. don and pat sit at the counter. don tries unsuccessfully to contain his frustration. pat don? don (still staring) what? pat well, look at me. don looks at her.  \\x0cpat well, you-you really don\\'t think that... that gizmo can foretell the future, do you? don it foretold ours. pat how? how did it? the counterman arrives and brings them a couple of glasses of water. counterman oh, back already. what\\'ll you have? don (to pat) honey? pat oh, i\\'ll have some iced coffee, please. counterman (to don) how \\'bout you? don same. the counterman goes to fetch the drinks. pat turns to don. pat all right. how? don when that car almost hit us it was three o\\'clock. exactly when that machine said. pat don. you said three o\\'clock. not the machine. you decided to sit in here as long as we did. you. oh, this is ridiculous. can\\'t you see that you made up all the details -- and all that-that thing did was give back generalities?  \\x0cdon what are you getting so upset about? pat you. that you could even consider the possibility that-don will you listen--? don and pat quiet down as the counterman arrives with the drinks. don (quietly, to pat) will you listen--? don suddenly sees that the little old ladies are getting up to leave. don (to the counterman) excuse me. counterman yes? don can you give me some pennies? counterman oh, sure. how many? don ten. the counterman grabs a huge jar of pennies and counts them out as the little old ladies leave the table. don (to pat) come on. don rises from the counter and hurries to the now-vacated table. one of the old ladies pays the counterman and they exit the diner. pat brings the drinks from the counter to the table where don sits, having already deposited a penny, with his finger under the devil\\'s chin. unlike  \\x0cearlier, pat sits on the opposite side of the table from don. don (to the seer) did you know about the car almost hitting us? don pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"what do you think?\"\" don looks at pat who looks away. don deposits another penny. don (to the seer) will we reach new york all right now? don pulls the lever and takes the card. he reads it silently, sighs, and smiles at pat. don (reads aloud) \"\"your chances are good.\"\" pat (ironic) very precise. don honey, what do you expect? a slip should come out and say \"\"hiya, donsy and patsy, so how\\'s by you?\"\" the counterman arrives and clears the table of the little old ladies\\' soda glasses. counterman excuse me. the counterman leaves with the dirty glasses.  \\x0cdon (quietly, to pat) i never said these slips were made for us personally. i only said-pat i heard. (tries to reason with him) don. don\\'t you realize that you could get the same kind of answers from any one of these machines in here? try and see. don the same kind, maybe, but not the same answers. don deposits a penny. don (to the seer) will it still take four hours before the car is ready? don pulls the lever and takes the card. he reads it silently, breaks into a broad grin, and shows it to pat. don hey. \"\"it has already been taken care of.\"\" pat (icily) swell. let\\'s go then. a man\\'s voice (to don) mister? don and pat turn to see the mechanic approaching them. as the mechanic speaks, don looks first at pat, who averts her eyes, and then the devil\\'s head, which merely grins at him. mechanic (to don) your car\\'s ready. got a lucky break. found a fuel pump right here in town. last one they had, too. (more)  \\x0cmechanic (cont\\'d) figured you\\'d be walking around a couple hours before you finally came to the garage so i come lookin\\' for ya. don (to the mechanic) thank you. we appreciate it. we\\'ll be right over. mechanic okey doke. the mechanic departs. don (pointedly, to pat) coincidence? pat yes. don all right, then. you ask it some questions. or are you afraid to? pat (gets an idea) all right. pat deposits a penny. pat (to the seer) will we reach columbus by tomorrow? don (to pat) we\\'re not going through colum-but pat knows this and figures she can stump the machine. she pulls the lever. don takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"if that\\'s what you really want.\"\" only a little discouraged, pat deposits a penny.  \\x0cpat (to the seer) will i ever be married? pat pulls the lever. don takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"the answer to that is obvious.\"\" pat deposits a penny. she\\'s a little fazed. pat (to the seer) it\\'s not possible to foretell the future, is it? don pulls the lever and takes the card. don (reads aloud) \"\"that\\'s up to you to find out.\"\" pat deposits a penny. she\\'s almost hysterical now. pat (to the seer) you\\'re just a stupid piece of junk, aren\\'t you? pat pulls the lever. don takes the card. don (almost gloating, reads aloud) \"\"it all depends upon your point of view.\"\" pat i don\\'t want to stay here anymore, don. pat rises abruptly and starts to leave. don grabs her arm. don even if it\\'s true?  \\x0cpat especially if it\\'s true. don what are you talking about? i think you are afraid of it. pat not of it. don of what then? pat don\\'t you know? but don doesn\\'t know. pat turns and starts to walk away. don doesn\\'t follow. he stays at the table and fanatically starts asking a series of questions, rapidly depositing pennies, pulling the lever and reading the cards to himself. pat watches in horror. don (to the seer) are we always gonna live in st. louis? are we going to live in the east? are we going to live in the west? are we going to live in this country? pat don. don. don what? pat let\\'s go. don (stares at the seer) no. pat are you just gonna stay here?  \\x0cdon i... don\\'t know. pat (crosses to him) oh, sweetheart. listen to me. please, if you love me, just listen to me... don cradles her face in his hands. don no, you listen to me. this machine is predicting our future. do you think i could just walk away from it? don cradles the seer. pat i\\'m not talking about that machine anymore. i\\'m talking about you. don is stung by this. pat are you just going to sit here and let that... that... that thing run your life? pat stalks away and turns her back on don. don run my life? don stares at the seer for a long moment, then rises and crosses to pat. don run my life? pat (turns to face him) isn\\'t that exactly what you\\'re letting it do? don, it made you call the office before. it made you stay here instead of leave. it made you afraid to walk down the street. and now it\\'s telling you where you\\'re going to live. why, it\\'s as if every superstitious feeling you ever had is (more)  \\x0cpat (cont\\'d) wrapped up in that one machine. it doesn\\'t matter whether it can foretell the future. what matters is whether you believe more in luck and in fortune than you do in yourself. well, you can decide your own life. (reaches out to him) you have a mind, a wonderful mind. don\\'t destroy it trying to justify that cheap penny fortune machine to yourself. don pat... pat (seems dazed) we can have a wonderful life together, if we make it wonderful... ourselves. i... pat buries her face in don\\'s chest. he embraces her. don pat... pat (sobs) i don\\'t want to know what\\'s going to happen. i want us to make it happen. don don\\'t cry, darling. don\\'t cry. the counterman approaches, concerned. counterman (to don) is there something wrong? don (to the counterman) no. no, no, it\\'s all right. the counterman withdraws.  \\x0cdon (to pat) don\\'t cry. we\\'ll go. we\\'ll go. you\\'re right, i\\'m a jerk. pat no, you\\'re not. you\\'re wonderful. don yes, yes, i am. i\\'m the world\\'s biggest jerk. come on. let\\'s go get our car. (more to the seer than to pat) yes, that\\'s right. let\\'s go get our car, we\\'ll drive out of this town and go where we want to go... anytime we please. pat oh, don, i love you. don i love you, too, baby. don kisses her on the mouth and leads her toward the door, stopping only to pay off the counterman. don (to the counterman) keep the change. counterman (to don) thanks! come on back now. don and pat exit. the door hasn\\'t even shut behind them when another couple, older and rather desperate looking, enter the diner, and move directly to the table where don and pat have spent much of the afternoon. the man places a handful of pennies on the table as they sit. an awkward pause follows. desperate woman (resignedly, to the man) go ahead. the man deposits a penny in the mystic seer.  \\x0cdesperate man (to the seer) can we ask some more questions now? the man pulls the lever and takes the card. he and the woman silently read it. she sighs in relief. he deposits a penny. desperate man (to the seer) do you think we might leave ridgeview today? the man pulls the lever and takes the card. he and the woman silently read it. she sighs again, this time in despair. he deposits a penny. desperate man (to the seer) is there any way out? any way at all? under the narration, the man pulls the lever and takes the card. the woman can\\'t bear to look. he reads the card silently and puts his hand to his mouth. he deposits a penny, asks a question and pulls the lever. narrator (v.o.) counterbalance in the little town of ridgeview, ohio. two people permanently enslaved by the tyranny of fear and superstition, facing the future with a kind of helpless dread... cut to: ext. main street - day don and pat in their convertible as they leave town via main street. narrator (v.o.) two others facing the future with confidence, having escaped one of the darker places of the twilight zone. don and pat turn a corner and disappear from view. the main street clock reads a little after 3:20.  \\x0cpan up to the sunny sky, dissolve to a starry night sky and fade out.  \\x0c \"\\r\\n3|Twilight Zone|Nightmare At 20000 Feet|October 11, 1963|\"the twilight zone episode 503: \"\"nightmare at 20,000 feet\"\"  by richard matheson  \\x0cact one fade in on an airplane cabin, one dark and stormy night in the early 1960s. airplane and crowd noise drowns out much of the conversation between the passengers getting on the plane and the blonde, clipboard-carrying stewardess who checks their boarding passes. a uniformed policeman, possibly a sheriff, enters and the stewardess sees that he\\'s wearing a gun on his hip, so he shows her his badge as well as his boarding pass. stewardess all right. fine. enjoy your flight. the policeman heads for his seat. one passenger later, an attractive couple enter. this is bob and julia wilson. bob gives the plane an apprehensive look while showing their passes to the stewardess. she clears them to go through. there\\'s no assigned seating so julia, leading the way, points out a couple of likely seats to bob. julia those all right? bob yeah. be fine. (off julia\\'s coat) here, give me that. bob stows their coats in the overhead bin. bob and julia start to sit -- julia on the aisle, bob by the window. julia (suddenly concerned) do you want me to sit next to the window? bob (reassuring) no. they sit. bob i\\'m fine. i can sit--  \\x0cbob sees that he\\'s seated by the auxiliary exit and tenses up. julia honey, what is it? the emergency window? you want to move? bob no, no, no. doesn\\'t matter. what\\'s the difference where i sit? it\\'s not the seat. it\\'s the airplane. bob takes out a pack of cigarettes and starts to light up. julia notices the non-smoking sign is lit. julia honey, don\\'t smoke that now. wait till the plane takes off. bob (puts the cigarette away) i\\'m not acting much like a cured man, am i? julia honey, you are cured. doctor martin wouldn\\'t let you fly if you weren\\'t, would he? bob i suppose not. julia (takes his arm) i mean if you weren\\'t well, doctor martin just wouldn\\'t let you fly all the way back home. it\\'s just that simple. bob well, you make it sound simple, anyway. julia it is, bob.  \\x0cbob yeah. here i am hogging the whole stage and you\\'re so tired. i\\'ve missed you... these last six months. bob kisses julia. they hold hands. julia it\\'s all over now, bob. and mama\\'s taking you home. julia steals a kiss. bob it must have been awful for you. taking care of the kids. bearing the full responsibility. julia well, everything is still intact. bob except me. the flight engineer gets ready to shut the cabin door. julia now, bob, i\\'m not going to let -the loud thump of the cabin door slamming shut startles bob. flight engineer (on the phone to the cockpit) cabin door secured. julia (off bob\\'s jumpiness) what? bob just a little... abject cowardice, that\\'s all. i\\'m gonna be all right. had a teensy weensy breakdown. now, i\\'m cured. understanding -- it\\'s wonderful. (more)  \\x0cbob (cont\\'d) it isn\\'t the airplane at all. overtension and overanxiety due to underconfidence. the cabin lights dim as the stewardess makes a final walk down the aisle before take-off. stewardess (to bob) seat belt, sir. a very nervous bob buckles himself. he glances around uncertainly, turns on the little lights above his seat, offers a smile to julia, and tries to stay calm. narrator (v.o.) portrait of a frightened man: mr. robert wilson, thirty-seven, husband, father, and salesman on sick leave. mr. wilson has just been discharged from a sanitarium where he spent the last six months recovering from a nervous breakdown, the onset of which took place on an evening not dissimilar to this one, on an airliner very much like the one in which mr. wilson is about to be flown home... a fast pan to the omniscient narrator, in suit and tie, standing beneath an airport direction sign that reads: \"\"terminal --->\"\" narrator ...the difference being that, on that evening half a year ago, mr. wilson\\'s flight was terminated by the onslaught of his mental breakdown. tonight, he\\'s traveling all the way to his appointed destination which, contrary to mr. wilson\\'s plan, happens to be in the darkest corner of the twilight zone. fade out  \\x0cfade in on the unlit no smoking and fasten seat belt signs at the front of the airplane\\'s cabin. the seat belt sign pops on just as the stewardess enters through the cockpit door just beneath them. she closes the door behind her and smiles at a few of the passengers, working her way up the aisle, eyeing everyone carefully. stewardess (to a passenger) fasten your seat belt, sir. the stewardess approaches bob and julia. stewardess (to a bob) fasten your seat belt, sir. bob starts to fasten his seat belt. cut to: the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- lots of wind and rain and lightning and thunder.  cut to:  the cabin where bob tries to fasten julia\\'s seat belt while she sleeps, only to wake her. bob sorry, darling. go back to sleep. julia i shouldn\\'t\\'ve taken that sleeping pill. i should stay awake with you. bob no, no, i don\\'t want you to, sweetheart. go back to sleep. i\\'m all right.  \\x0cjulia can\\'t you sleep? bob i will. don\\'t worry about me. julia okay. julia pulls her jacket over her and nods off while bob turns to his newspaper. he glances out the window which directly overlooks the wing of the plane. it\\'s dark and rainy but two prop engines are clearly visible. as bob continues to stare, he spots something besides wind-swept rainwater moving on the wing. it looks like the figure of a man. an ape-like man skulking slowly across the wing. the wind ought to have blown this creature away, but it easily stands upright, unaffected by the weather or the airspeed. bob is wild-eyed in disbelief. he turns to julia twice, but she\\'s asleep. he looks out the window. the creature squats and seems to be staring back at him, sort of taking an interest in bob, the way a man might take an interest in an animal locked up in a cage at the zoo. an alarmed bob starts looking around for the stewardess. she\\'s nowhere to be seen. bob frantically pushes the button above his seat to summon her. he stops only to check that the creature on the wing is still there. it is. it watches bob with curiosity. the stewardess enters the cabin and bob beckons to her. bob here. quickly! stewardess may i help you? bob there\\'s a man out there! stewardess what? bob look, look, he\\'s crawling on--  \\x0cbob turns back to the window. the creature is gone. bob\\'s eyes widen. he stares out the window for a long moment and then, turns apologetically to the stewardess just as julia wakes up. bob sorry. it must have been... julia bob? what is it? stewardess (to julia) oh, it\\'s nothing, mrs. wilson. (to bob) can i get you anything? bob a glass of water. stewardess surely. the stewardess departs. julia rubs her eyes. bob stares out the window and tries to come to grips with what he\\'s just seen. julia something wrong? bob no. i-i thought i saw something out there. julia what? bob realizes he can\\'t tell her. she\\'ll think he\\'s cracking up. he shakes his head. bob nothing. bob closes the window\\'s curtain to block his view of the wing. bob i guess i need a little sleep.  \\x0cjulia are you all right? bob yeah, fine. julia (checks her watch) don\\'t you think you ought to take a sleeping pill now? bob (rubs his eyes) yeah, i-i\\'ll take one of those, uh... julia digs the pills out of her purse as the stewardess arrives with a paper cup of water. bob lets out his breath, trying to compose himself. stewardess here you are. bob thank you. stewardess you\\'re welcome. can i get you a blanket? bob no. (to julia) honey? julia hands bob the sleeping pills. julia (to the stewardess) oh, no thanks. the stewardess leaves. bob swallows the pill and the entire cup of water. cut to: the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- more wind and rain and lightning and thunder.  \\x0ccut to: the airplane\\'s cabin, a little later, where julia is ready to go back to sleep. julia you\\'ll be all right now? bob yeah, fine. julia will you wake me if you need me? bob i will. julia shuts her eyes and dozes off. bob takes a deep breath and shuts his eyes. but they don\\'t stay shut. the thing on the wing is still bothering him. he glances at julia. seeing that she\\'s asleep, bob hesitantly lifts his hand to the window curtain. but he immediately lowers it, afraid of what he might see on the other side. after a long moment, he comes to a decision. very slowly, he reaches for the curtain. abruptly, he whips the curtain away to reveal the creature\\'s hideous face pressed against the glass, staring at bob curiously. bob freaks. he shuts his eyes, rears his head back, opens his mouth, and starts whispering to himself. bob it isn\\'t there. it isn\\'t there. bob opens his eyes but does not look at the window. bob (weakly, to julia) honey? would you wake up, honey? but she\\'s fast asleep. bob sees the creature hasn\\'t moved. panicking, bob sees the stewardess. bob (gestures to the stewardess) quickly! while bob turns to the stewardess, the creature nonchalantly flies straight up and out of view. the  \\x0cstewardess arrives just as bob turns back to the window. stewardess yes, mr. wilson? bob doesn\\'t respond. he\\'s staring out the window at the empty wing. stewardess can i help you, mr. wilson? bob tries to regain his composure. bob are we going into a storm? stewardess (smiles) just a small one. nothing to worry about. the stewardess walks off. bob shuts his eyes and tries to get a grip. bob (to julia) honey? would you wake up please, honey? as he says this, the creature flies down to the wing and lands just behind one of the engines. bob sees it as it lands and their eyes meet. bob watches and winces as the creature saunters forward, sits casually astride an engine, and pokes curiously at the rapidly spinning propellers with its fingers. the creature backs away from the propellers and begins to pry up a cowling plate that covers the engine. bob stares in horror as the creature easily pulls up the metal plate to reveal the hot, glowing engine underneath. as it does so, the creature shoots bob a glance. fade out on a terrified bob mouthing the word \"\"no.\"\" end of act one  \\x0cact two fade in on the plane flying through dark storm clouds -- still more wind and rain and lightning and thunder. cut to: bob trying to awaken julia. bob honey... julia, wake up. julia awakes with a start. julia what? bob turns to the window just in time to see the creature take off into the air. julia, of course, fails to see anything. julia what are you looking at? bob? is it the storm? does it bother you? bob no. honey, you remember what i told you before about seeing something outside? julia yes. bob julia, there\\'s a man out there. julia gives bob a blank, uncomprehending look. thunder roars. bob i-i don\\'t mean a man, i mean... i don\\'t know what i mean. i mean, maybe a... what\\'d they call them during the war? you know, the p-pilots? gremlins! gremlins. you remember the stories of the...  \\x0cjulia just stares at him. bob julia, don\\'t look at me like that. julia bob... bob i am not imagining it. i\\'m not imagining it. he\\'s out there. julia glances at the window. bob don\\'t look. he\\'s not there now. he... (realizes all too well how crazy this sounds) he jumps away whenever anyone might see him. except me. honey, he\\'s there. i realize what this sounds like. do i look insane? julia no, darling, no. bob i know i had a mental breakdown. i know i had it in an airplane. i know it looks to you as if the same thing\\'s happening again, but it isn\\'t. i\\'m sure it isn\\'t. look, the reason i\\'m telling you this... isn\\'t just to worry you. you notice i didn\\'t tell you before. julia well, i want you to tell me. bob i didn\\'t tell you before because i wasn\\'t sure whether it was real or not. but i am sure now. it is real. there\\'s a man out there. or a ... a gremlin, or... whatever it... (almost laughs) (more)  \\x0cbob (cont\\'d) if i described him to you, you\\'d really think i was gone. julia (already thinks he\\'s gone) no, darling, it\\'s all right. it\\'s all right. bob julia, i know your intentions are good. i know you love me. and sympathize with me. but don\\'t patronize me. i am not insane. julia did i say --? bob does it have to be said? it\\'s in your face, in your--look, for the last time, that creature\\'s out there. and the reason i\\'m telling you is, he\\'s starting to tamper with one of the engines. look, look. look. think anything you want. think i belong in a straitjacket, if it pleases you. julia if it pleases me!? bob no, no, i-i-i-i didn\\'t mean that. what i mean is, whatever you think of me--that i\\'m losing my mind, anything -- all i\\'m asking you to do is to tell the pilots what i\\'ve said. ask them to keep an eye on the wings. if they see nothing... all right. all right, then i\\'ll... commit myself. but if they do... julia tries very hard not to look at bob as if he were a madman. bob won\\'t you even allow the possibility--?  \\x0cjulia i\\'ll tell them. bob i know it\\'s asking a lot. i-- i-iit\\'s like asking you to... advertise your marriage to a lunatic. julia no, i\\'ll tell them. you just sit tight and i\\'ll go tell them. julia unbuckles her seat, rises, heads down the aisle to the cockpit door, and urgently knocks. the stewardess rushes to her from the rear of the plane. stewardess mrs. wilson, what\\'s the problem? may i help you? julia oh-oh, yes, my husband wants to see the flight engineer. stewardess all right, if you\\'ll stay right here, i\\'ll have him see you. julia oh, thank you, it\\'s very important. still in his seat, bob glances out the window just as the gremlin lands on the wing. julia (to the stewardess) hurry, please. bob watches the creature as it reaches to pry up the cowling plate again. bob (to julia) hurry! hurry! the flight engineer stands talking with julia at the cockpit door. he rushes over to bob. julia follows.  \\x0cbob (to the flight engineer) he\\'s out there! flight engineer what\\'s going on? bob he\\'s pulling up one of the cowling plates. flight engineer he? bob didn\\'t my wife--? there\\'s a man out there! flight engineer listen, keep your voice down. bob i\\'m sorry, i\\'m sorry, i-i-i-flight engineer i don\\'t know what\\'s going on here. bob will you look? flight engineer mr. wilson, i\\'m warning you. bob will you please look? in the name of -bob, julia and the flight engineer all peer out the window at the empty wing. the cowling plate appears untouched. a long pause. flight engineer well? bob oh, now wait a minute. i saw him pull that plate up.... julia and the flight engineer just look at bob with blank  \\x0cstares. bob (insistent) i said, i saw him pull that plate up. flight engineer mr. wilson, please. all right, you saw him, but there are other people aboard. we mustn\\'t alarm them. bob (surprised) you mean you\\'ve seen him too? flight engineer of course we have. but we don\\'t want to frighten the passengers. you can understand that? bob of course... (bob suddenly realizes he\\'s being humored) i understand. flight engineer now, the thing we gotta remember... bob (darkly) you can stop now. julia bob! flight engineer sir... bob get out of here. flight engineer mr. wilson... bob i said, you can stop.  \\x0cjulia honey, what is it? bob (turns away from them) i won\\'t say another word. i\\'ll see us crash first. julia bob! flight engineer mr. wilson, try to understand our position. julia honey, i\\'ll be right back. julia and the flight engineer head to the back of the plane, leaving bob to bang his fists into his temples. bob (whispers to himself) he did pull it up. he did. in the rear of the cabin, the flight engineer hands julia some pills--sedatives. meanwhile, bob watches as, once again, the gremlin pulls up the cowling plate. bob looks back at julia, realizes he can\\'t say anything, and pounds his fist into his chair. julia starts to walk back down the aisle to bob. bob turns back to the window to see the gremlin, on cue, playfully stick out its arms and fly away. julia sits down next to bob. julia honey, i was going to tell them when you-bob were you? julia hands bob the sedative and a cup of water. bob for me? julia please, bob.  \\x0cbob puts the pill in his mouth and drinks the water. julia you\\'ll sleep--you\\'ll sleep now, darling. hm? bob sure. the two of them lean back in their chairs and an uneasy silence ensues. bob closes his eyes. a deeply concerned julia gazes at him. the flight engineer makes his way down the aisle and confers with the stewardess. flight engineer oh, boy. stewardess what\\'d you do? get his wife to give him one of those pills? flight engineer he\\'ll be out for hours. stewardess well, i hope so, the way the storm\\'s coming up. flight engineer don\\'t worry, betty, everything\\'s fine. stewardess i hope so. the stewardess heads for the rear. the flight engineer heads for the cockpit. julia sleeps. bob sleeps. ah, but he only appears to sleep. he opens his eyes and looks out the window. nothing. he puts his hand to his mouth and removes the unswallowed sedative from his cheek -- just as the gremlin flies down to the wing. bob reacts by throwing the sedative on the floor in disgust. the gremlin immediately pries up the cowling plate and  \\x0cstarts tinkering with the engine. bob looks around the cabin helplessly. suddenly, his eye falls on the holstered gun of the policeman, who sleeps in an aisle seat, a few rows behind bob. bob formulates a plan. he unbuckles his seat belt, rises, and slowly walks down the aisle toward the sleeping policeman, clearly intending to steal the gun. but before bob can reach the seat, the policeman shifts his arm, covering the holster. bob backs off, turns, and pulls out his pack of cigarettes. the policeman moves his arm off the gun and bob makes his move. pretending to drop the cigarettes in the aisle next to the policeman, bob kneels down and recovers the pack, then gently lifts the gun out of the holster, and hides it in his jacket. quickly returning to his seat, bob draws the gun, and then stops. the gremlin continues its interminable sabotage operation on the engine. bob realizes he can\\'t shoot through the plane window. he sees the auxiliary exit handle and knows he must open the door to get a clear shot. he pockets the weapon and buckles himself in. he is about to draw the gun when he thinks of julia\\'s safety. bob honey? honey, would you get me a glass of water, please? julia wakes up with a start, surprised to find bob wide awake. bob a glass of water. please? hurry. without a word, a confused julia heads for the rear of the plane and talks with the stewardess. seeing that she\\'s safely in the rear of the plane, bob draws the gun, releases its safety catch, removes the plastic guard from the auxiliary exit handle, takes one last look around, notes the location of the gremlin--still leaning over the engine--and, steeling himself, releases the emergency door. the door flies off instantly and bob is nearly sucked out, his seat belt barely securing him to the plane. julia, the stewardess, and everybody else in the cabin start screaming.  \\x0cbob, in excruciating pain--half in his seat and halfway out the door--is pressed against the outside of the airplane by the tremendous wind, trying to get a two-fisted grip on the gun and bring it to bear on the gremlin. the startled creature stands a few feet away and starts walking toward bob. slowly, bob struggles to aim the weapon. the creature is closing in. with a herculean effort, bob aims and fires, emptying the gun into the gremlin. it topples backward onto the wing. after the sixth shot, bob lets go of the gun and screams. cut to: the inside of the nearly empty cabin, sometime later that night. all is quiet. the policeman puts his hat on. a peaceful, smiling bob, straitjacketed and strapped to a stretcher, is carried down the aisle and out of the plane by two attendants. cut to: an airport runway at night, seconds later. the plane is on the ground. the storm is over. the policeman silently leads the stretcher-bearers and julia off the plane to a waiting ambulance and police car. the police radio chatters. the flight engineer and the stewardess watch the preparations to load bob into the ambulance. flight engineer (to the stewardess) nuttiest way of trying to commit suicide i\\'ve ever heard of. julia stands over the stretcher, comforting bob. julia (to bob) it\\'s all right now, darling. a triumphant bob struggles to sit upright. bob i know. but i\\'m the only one who does know... right now. tired but happy, bob lies back down. the attendants lift  \\x0chim into the ambulance. narrator (v.o.) the flight of mr. robert wilson has ended now, a flight not only from point a to point b, but also from the fear of recurring mental breakdown. mr. wilson has that fear no longer... slow pan from the ambulance to the plane\\'s wing, where the pried-up cowling plate is plainly visible. narrator (v.o.) ...though, for the moment, he is, as he has said, alone in this assurance. happily, his conviction will not remain isolated too much longer, for happily, tangible manifestation is very often left as evidence of trespass, even from so intangible a quarter as the twilight zone. fade out  \\x0c \"\\r\\n4|Twilight Zone|Nothing in the Dark|January 5, 1962|\"the twilight zone \"\"nothing in the dark\"\" written by george clayton johnson  \\x0cact one fade in and pan down to a large, darkened basement room in a decrepit tenement building, just before sunrise. through the half-boarded up windows, falling snow is visible. the room is cluttered with worse-for-wear furniture including a table with a teapot on top, an ornate mirror, and, against one wall, an old-fashioned bed. the bed is surrounded by wooden chairs that are meant to act as a sort of makeshift barrier. in the bed, an old woman sleeps, white-haired and wrinkled. her name is wanda dunn. just outside her window, at street level, the figure of a uniformed police officer appears and crouches near a lamp post, apparently taking cover while he observes someone or something across the street from the tenement building. the sound of breaking glass from the street awakens wanda. she looks up, fear in her face, and turns to the window. the backs of the wooden chairs cast shadows on her that resemble prison bars. she sees the policeman and tenses up. pushing a chair aside, she puts on a pair of slippers, rises from her bed, and crosses to the only door, to make sure that its locks are secure. satisfied, she turns to the window where the policeman still waits and watches. a noise from the street stirs the policeman who rises and disappears from view. wanda wraps a shawl around herself and breathes a sigh of relief at his departure. she is on her way back to bed when a piercing whistle blows, followed by two loud gunshots. startled, wanda turns to see and hear the policeman stagger into view and fall from street level, down a flight of steps, to just outside her door. she moves to the door, fearfully, and presses herself against it. the policeman’s gasping voice calls out. his name is harold belden. belden (offscreen) help. please, help. wanda who is it? go away.  \\x0cbelden (offscreen) i’ve been shot. i need help. wanda who are you? belden (offscreen) officer... police... please, open the door. i need help. she makes no move to help him. wanda you’re lying to me. i know you. you can’t fool me. belden (offscreen) help. wanda you’re lying. you’re no policeman. why can’t you leave me alone? i know who you are. i know what you are. her chin trembles. a fast pan off of wanda reveals the ornate mirror opposite her -- in which stands the omniscient narrator, wearing a suit and tie. narrator an old woman, living in a nightmare. an old woman who has fought a thousand battles with death and always won. now she’s faced with a grim decision. whether or not to open a door. and in some strange and frightening way, she knows that this seemingly ordinary door leads to the twilight zone. fade out fade in on wanda, still pressed against the door.  \\x0cbelden (offscreen) won’t somebody help? wanda hesitatingly opens the door -- but leaves the chain bolted. through the crack, wanda sees the handsome, young, uniformed officer harold belden lying on his back in the snow, gasping for breath, and in great pain. belden unless... you help me, i’m going to die. ii don’t think i can move. wanda don’t say that. it isn’t fair. you’re trying to trick me. (abruptly) don’t move. i-i-i-i’ll close the door. belden what? listen, i’ve been shot. i’m bleeding to death. please. my name is harold belden. i need a doctor. please, call the hospital. wanda i haven’t got a telephone. i’d have to unlock the door. you can’t ask me to do that. i don’t want to die. you understand? i know who you are. belden (incredulous) you’re not going to help me? you’re going to let me die? i don’t understand. but -(wincing in pain) it hurts... it hurts... wanda stop. stop. why do you torture me? it isn’t fair. belden i can’t move. it hurts.  \\x0cwanda it isn’t fair. it isn’t fair. but she knows she has no choice. reluctantly, wanda unchains the door and lets it swing wide open. she hesitates a moment and then scurries outside to belden, bends down, and touches his shoulder. in awe, she draws her hand away, looks at it, and then stares at belden. wanda i’m still alive. a wave of joy sweeps over her face. at once, she helps belden to crawl into her room. once safely inside, she quickly shuts and locks the door. dissolve to wanda’s basement room, a few minutes later. belden rests in a bed on the opposite side of the room as wanda’s. wanda fixes him some hot tea. belden listen, you should try and get some rest. really, i feel much better. when the doctor gets here, he’ll take me off your hands. belden sees the tense expression on wanda’s face. belden you didn’t call the doctor? wanda shakes her head. belden why not? wanda i haven’t got a telephone. belden but couldn’t you go to one of the neighbors? wanda there aren’t any. they’ve all moved away. trucks came and took away their furniture.

(touches her face) people said i’d spoil my fine complexion. i didn’t care. i loved outdoor things. i lived out in the sunlight. wanda looks down and sees that, beside her on the floor, a small patch of sunlight has found its way through her boarded up windows. she reaches out and puts her hand in its warmth. wanda i’ve always hated the dark and the cold. i’m old. i’ve lived a long time. but i don’t want to die. (more)  \\x0cwanda (cont\\'d) i’d rather live in the dark than not live at all. belden leans forward to hand her his empty teacup and winces in pain. belden here. there’s nothing to be afraid of. we’re alone here. and there’s nobody at the door. you need some rest-the pain becomes too much for him and he leans back in his bed. belden and i need help. at a loss as to what to do, wanda rises and walks away from him, wringing her hands. she closes a cabinet door, sits on a table, and paces nervously about. suddenly, her attention is drawn to something outside a window. a burly man is walking down the stairs to her door. he knocks. belden gives wanda a look, but she is paralyzed with fear, clutching her bed frame, and shaking her head. the knocking continues throughout. wanda no. belden there’s nothing to be afraid of. you’d better answer it. wanda moves slowly to the door. belden go on. that’s right. go ahead. go ahead, answer it. wanda leaves the chain on, but opens the door a crack. the burly man’s face appears. he tries to push the door in. man i’m sorry, lady, but i’ve got my orders. wanda panics and tries to slam the door shut, but the man gets his foot in.  \\x0cman i can’t fool around any longer. he’s too strong for her. the chain breaks and he forces the door in and wanda collapses to the floor. she lies completely still. is she unconscious? dead? the man moves to her body at once and places his hand on her neck. fade out on the image of the man’s hand is this the touch of death? end of act one  \\x0cact two fade in on the man standing over wanda, minutes later. she is in her bed now. and the man is rubbing her hand as she regains consciousness. man easy, lady. just lie quiet till you get your strength back. you gave me quite a scare when you caved in like that. wanda stares at the man’s face and then at her hand in his. wanda and still i live. man well... you’ve got to understand, ma’am. ii don’t get no pleasure out of bustin’ in doors. you don’t seem to realize how important this is. i’ve got a crew and equipment coming in an hour to pull this tenement down. beggin’ your pardon, ma’am, but it’s long overdue. i-i’m surprised it’s still standing. wanda and you’re really... not mister death? man i don’t know what you’re talking about. all i know is i got a contract to demolish this row of buildings. everybody else moved out long ago. until the other day, i thought this building was deserted. i-i seen them windows boarded up and i-i figured you moved when the rest of them did. wanda you want me to go outside? you want me to leave here? i can’t. man you were notified months ago, right? i’m just trying to do my job. these buildings were condemned by the city and i’m the one (more)  \\x0cman (cont\\'d) who’s got to tear them down. wanda how can you? man this building has had it. it’s worn out. used up. all these buildings have got to come down. wanda clutches the bars of her bed frame in a way that suggests she is trapped in a cage. man i ain’t a monster, lady. i’ve got a heart just like anybody else, but, uh -- i can see how you could get attached to a place and not want to see it wrecked but when a building is old, it’s dangerous. it’s gotta come down to make room for a new one. that’s life, lady. old make room for the new. people get the idea that i’m some kind of destroyer but -- they think i get kicks out of, uh, tearing stuff down. that ain’t the way it is. i just clear the ground so that other people can build. in a way, i help them do it. look around, it’s the way things are. a big tree falls and new ones grow right out of the same ground. old animals die and young ones take their places. even people step aside when it’s time. wanda i won’t. wanda suddenly notices that her door is wide open. wanda the door! she rises at once and shuts it. the man confronts her.  \\x0cman there’s no need in... wanda turns from him and presses herself against the door. man what’s the sense of locking a door that won’t even be here in an hour? if you’ve got any possessions you’d want to keep, ii’d move them out. i’ll help ya. wanda turns to glare at him. man now, look, i’ve been trying to go easy but if you insist on staying here, i’ll have to call a cop. please cooperate, lady. the mention of the police reminds wanda of something. she leaves the door and crosses halfway to the mysteriously silent belden, still lying in bed on the other side of the room. wanda (to herself) of course. (to belden) explain to him. tell him the reason i can’t go out there. you’ll help me, won’t you? belden merely looks at her, saying nothing. the man joins wanda in the middle of the room and stares right at belden, but is somehow unable to see him. man (to wanda) what are you doing? who’re you talking to? wanda (to the man) mister belden is a policeman. (to belden) please tell him. but belden remains silent. and the man sees no one. the man looks at wanda as if she’s crazy.  \\x0cman (to wanda) i’m sorry, but if you’re still here when the crew arrives, i-i’ll have to call a cop. the man crosses to the door, opens it, pauses to look back sympathetically at wanda, then exits, leaving the door wide open. wanda watches him go, then turns to belden. wanda why didn’t you help me? she hurriedly crosses to the door. wanda i thought you understood. she shuts the door and, as she does so, it begins to dawn on her. she turns back to belden. wanda you. he looked right at you... and didn’t see you. (full realization) no! belden look in the mirror, wanda. wanda turns, walks to the ornate mirror, and looks. in the mirror, belden’s bed is empty. she turns quickly to see -and a fast pan reveals -- belden still lying in the bed. wanda you tricked me! it was you all the time. belden yes. i tricked you. wanda but why? the moment i let you inside, you could have taken me. anytime. but you were nice. you made me trust you. slowly, belden sits up in bed, no longer in pain.  \\x0cbelden but i had to make you understand. am i really so bad? am i really so frightening? you’ve talked to me. you’ve confided in me. have i tried to hurt you? belden rises. belden it isn’t me you’re afraid of. you understand me. what you’re afraid of is the unknown. don’t. don’t be afraid. wanda but i am afraid. belden takes a step toward wanda. belden the running’s over. it’s time to rest. (offers his hand) give me your hand. wanda i don’t want to die. belden trust me. wanda no. no. belden (gently) mother... (steps forward) give me your hand. an odd expression crosses wanda’s face. very slowly, she takes his hand. belden smiles. belden you see? no shock. no engulfment. no tearing asunder. what you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper. what you thought was the end is the beginning.  \\x0cwanda when will it happen? when will we go? belden go? look. he nods toward her bed. she turns and sees... her body lying on the mattress, a peaceful smile on its face. she turns back to belden and grins. belden we have already begun. belden opens the door and leads wanda to the doorway. the room magically darkens behind them as belden offers wanda his arm and she takes it. they walk into the sunshine, up the stairs, and down the street, chatting amiably. narrator (voice over) there was an old woman who lived in a room and, like all of us, was frightened of the dark. but who discovered in the minute last fragment of her life that there was nothing in the dark that wasn’t there when the lights were on. object lesson for the more frightened amongst us -- in or out of the twilight zone. pan up and dissolve to to a field of stars in a night sky and fade out.  \\x0c \"\\r\\n5|Twilight Zone|One for the Angels|October 9, 1959|\"102: \"\"one for the angels\"\" written by rod serling  \\x0cact one ext. sky [night] shot of the sky... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp, sparkling relief. as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens -narrator\\'s voice there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. it is a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity. it is the middle ground between light and shadow -- between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man\\'s fears and the summit of his knowledge. this is the dimension of imagination. it is an area which we call the twilight zone. the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot (each week the opening shot of the play) ext. city street [day] long angle shot looking down at lew bookman -- dumpy, shabby little man in a mangled seersucker suit, the pants too short and the coat too long. a flamboyant tie askew at the neck with a misshapen knot and a summer pork pie hat tilted rakishly and idiotically at an angle on his head -- these set off the odd, bizarre quality of the little man. he has a pitch stand set up in front of him with perhaps two dozen items -- everything from toys to needles and thread, cheap ties, can openers, radio tubes, et al. it\\'s a sweltering july afternoon and lew goes through a half-hearted, stumbling pitch that attracts no one. lew here you are, ladies and gentlemen... nice things for the home... wearing apparel, toys... everything. special july clean-up sale!  \\x0clong angle shot looking down on lew as he continues to talk. over this tableau we hear the narrator\\'s voice. narrator\\'s voice street scene... summer... the present. man on a sidewalk -- age, sixtyish; occupation -- pitchman. name -- lew bookman. a fixture of the summer. a rather minor component to a hot july. a nondescript, commonplace little man whose life is a treadmill built out of sidewalks.

(he takes a deep breath) i just never will understand you people. you get this idiotic notion that life goes on forever, and of course it doesn\\'t. everyone has to go sometime. lew go? you mean -stranger (nods, walking around the room, surveying things) that\\'s right. he stops and looks down at the flowers on the windowsill. lew i won second prize last year at the ymha flower show. wisteria, open class. stranger how nice. (he turns and looks at lew) and what i further don\\'t understand is how little you appreciate the nature of your departure. (more)  \\x0cstranger (cont\\'d) think of the poor souls who go in violent accidents. these are the non- precognition victims. we\\'re not permitted to forewarn them. you, mr. bookman, fall into the category of -(he clears his throat) natural causes. lew (takes a step toward him) natural causes? (he points a slightly wavering finger at the stranger) i find you a very devious sort. this is not to say dishonest. why don\\'t you say what you mean? stranger mr. bookman, i have done everything but phone your own undertaker. how much clearer do you want it? if you still don\\'t know who i am -(he turns toward the flowers) then you are the most dense man i\\'ve come up against. closer shot stranger as he touches one of the flowers. it wilts under his touch, falls forward on its stem and dies. extremely tight close shot the flower the camera pans up for a shot of lew as he reacts. lew you\\'re... death? stranger (another deep sigh) exactly, mr. bookman. now shall we get down to business? time of departure is midnight tonight. i trust that will suit you. (more)  \\x0cstranger (cont\\'d) the preordination is for death during nap. i presume this too will meet with your approval. you\\'ll find this a relatively simple and painless and barely noticeable -close shot lew nervous fingers beat a tattoo all over his face and finally he shouts. lew please! i don\\'t want to go! two shot stranger (to himself) they never do. lew but i can\\'t go yet. there\\'s nothing wrong with me. i\\'m a healthy man. outside of a cold last winter and an infected sliver, i don\\'t think i\\'ve been sick a day in the past twenty years. stranger that\\'s as it may be, but departure time is set for midnight and departure time will be at midnight. lew don\\'t i have anything to say about that? stranger we do listen to appeals. (he opens the ledger) but frankly, mr. bookman, i must tell you quite frankly that there\\'s very little here in the way of an extenuating circumstance. there are three major categories of appeals. one is hardship cases. now do you have a wife or family who might suffer your (more)  \\x0cstranger (cont\\'d) demise beyond a reasonable point? lew (shakes his head) no, no family. stranger second category is priority cases. statesmen, scientists. men on the verge of discoveries. (he looks up at lew then over to the pitchman\\'s satchel) i take is you\\'re not working on any major scientific pursuit at the moment. lew (in a whisper) no, i\\'m not. (then after a pause) what about the third category? stranger well, mr. bookman, that would be unfinished business of a major nature. lew (turns to look at the stranger) i\\'ve never made a truly successful pitch. i mean... i mean a big pitch. i mean a pitch so big the sky will open up. (and then with intensity) a pitch for the angels. (a pause) i guess that wouldn\\'t mean much to you. (he turns away again) but it would mean a great deal to me. it would mean... it would mean that -(his face is very soft now and reflective) i could have one moment in my whole life when i was successful at something. just one moment when the children would be able (more)  \\x0clew (cont\\'d) to... would be able to feel proud of me. stranger (displaying no emotions at all) the children? lew (nods, his face suddenly carries with it a peculiar brightness) i\\'ve always had rather a fondness for children. close shot stranger stranger (dispassionately) that\\'s in the record here. (then there\\'s barely a perceptible softening of his face as he stares intently at lew) problem here, mr. bookman, is that you\\'d require a delay until -two shot lew and stranger lew until i could make a pitch. i mean the kind of pitch i told you about. stranger (with a half-smile) one for the angels, you mean? (there\\'s a brief pause) i\\'m terribly sorry, mr. bookman... you see these categories are fairly specific and when reference is made to unfinished business of a major nature, well the only interpretation to be made here is simply that... what i mean is that unfortunately, mr. bookman, the ability to achieve success in a given professional venture is really (more)  \\x0cstranger (cont\\'d) hardly of a major -he stops abruptly, suddenly conscious of the face of lewis j. bookman. suddenly aware of the poignance of it, the pathos of it, the infinite sadness, and with it the infinite gentleness and kindness. the stranger clears his throat, looks away, drums with his fingers on the ledger, then looks back at bookman. stranger mean a great deal to you, does it? lew (intensely) a great deal. stranger uh huh. (purses his lips, drums again with his fingers, walks over to the window then turns back to lew) all right, mr. bookman. under the circumstances i believe we could grant you a delay. lew until? stranger (pettishly) what do you mean, \"\"until?\"\" until you\\'ve made this... this \"\"pitch\"\" you\\'re talking about. lew i can stay alive until then? stranger that\\'s the arrangement. close shot lew as his eyes narrow and a very wise, rather cat-got-canary look covers his face. then he smiles.  \\x0clew i think that\\'s a fine bargain. it\\'s been awfully nice talking to you... mr... i didn\\'t get your name. he opens the door and motions. two shot stranger (heading toward the door) now about this pitch, mr. bookman. when might we expect it? lew when?

(then he giggles again and slams the door shut and shouts) because i am!

(a pause) got a cigarette?  a pack of cigarettes passes in front of the camera. janet‘s nurse‘s hand moves toward the pack and takes out a cigarette, then moves out of the frame. there‘s the sound of a match being struck o.c., then a cloud of smoke exhaled into the  air. the camera moves around so that it is shooting through the smoke across the desk, down toward the corridor and janet\\'s room. at this moment we freeze frame. two nurses walking down the corridor away from the camera stop and become immobile, and over this tableau we hear serling\\'s voice.  serling\\'s voice suspended in time and space for a moment .  out of janet tyler\\'s room now walks serling. behind him we still see the stationary figures of the nurses.  serling  you have been introduced to miss janet tyler, who lives in a very private world of darkness; a universe whose dimensions are the size, thickness, length of a swathe of bandages that cover her face. in a moment we\\'ll go back into this room, and also in a moment we\\'ll look under the bandages.  (a pause) keeping in mind, of course, that we\\'re not to be surprised by what we see, because this isn\\'t just a hospital. and this patient 307 is not just a woman. this happens to be the twilight zone...and miss janet tyler, patient number 307...with you, is about to enter it!  fade to black--opening billboard-—first commercial--fade on:  16. int. hospital room [night] extremely tight profile shot bandaged face of janet tyler  beyond, at the far end of the room, are the shadowy figures of the doctor and the nurse. we hear them indistinctly and muffled. occasionally words like \"\"temperature,\"\" \"\"pressure,\"\" \"\"thyroid,\"\" \"\"injection\"\" can be heard above the general indistinct rumble of their voices. finally the doctor takes a step toward the camera and the bed, his face still in the shadows.  doctor (over his shoulder) come back about eleven, nurse. give her the usual sedative then.  nurse all right, doctor.  the camera arcs around so that it is shooting behind the doctor as he approaches the bed. he reaches it, picks up janet\\'s arm, briefly checks her pulse while he looks down at her.  doctor warm this evening, miss tyler.  janet i thought it was. i couldn\\'t be sure, though.  doctor (running a hand through his collar) very warm. you can take my word for it. we\\'ll have those bandages off you very shortly. i expect you\\'re uncomfortable.  janet i\\'m used to bandages on my face.  doctor i\\'ve no doubt. this is your...ninth visit here? is it the ninth?  janet  the eleventh.  (a pause as she turns  her bandaged face  toward him) sometimes i think i\\'ve lived my whole life inside a dark cave. the walls are gauze. and the wind that blows in from the mouth of the cave always smells of ether and disinfectant.  (a pause) there‘s a kind of a comfort though, doctor, to living in this cave. it\\'s so wonderfully private.  (she turns her head  away) no one can ever see me.  (another pause) it\\'s hopeless, isn\\'t it, doctor? i‘ll never look any different.  doctor  (putting her wrist  down) that\\'s hard to say. up to now you haven\\'t responded to the medication or to the shots or any of the proven techniques. frankly, you\\'ve stumped us, miss tyler. nothing we\\'ve done so far has made any difference at all. but we\\'re hopeful of what this last treatment may have accomplished. there\\'s no telling, of course - not till we get the bandages off. unfortunately your case is one that can\\'t be handled with plastic surgery. bone structure, flesh type...many factors prohibit this kind of approach.  i .  he turns away. the camera arcs around with him so that he\\'s never full on camera.  doctor (cont\\'d) your eleventh visit.  a pause. he moves over to the table, taps on it tentatively. 17. close shot his fingers as they tap.  18. angle shot looking across janet toward the slouched figure of the doctor there‘s a silence and finally janet breaks it.  janet no more after this, are there? no more tries.  doctor eleven is the mandatory number of experiments. (he shrugs) no more are permitted after eleven.  janet now what?  doctor well you\\'re kind of jumping the gun, miss tyler. you may very well have responded to these last injections. there\\'s no way of telling till we get those bandages off.  janet but if i haven\\'t responded — then what?  doctor  there are alternatives.  janet like?  the doctor starts to turn. we cut abruptly before he gets to face the camera to:  doctor don\\'t you know?  janet (very softly) i know.  doctor (approaching the bed) you realize, of course, miss tyler, why these rules are in effect? (more)  doctor (cont\\'d) each of us is afforded as much opportunity as possible to fit in with society. in your case, think of the time and money and effort expended to make you look—  he stops abruptly. his head goes down as if searching for a word.  janet to make me look like what?  doctor normal. the way you\\'d like to look.  20. different angle janet as she rises in bed, supporting herself on her elbows.  janet  doctor? may i walk outdoors? may i sit out on the lawn? just for a little while. just to smell the flowers. just to...just to feel the air. just for...just for...  (she bolts upright in  bed now. her voice  takes on a different  tone, a strained,  tight, close—to-  breaking harshness) to make believe, doctor! to make believe that i ag normal. if i sit outside in the darkness, then i kn0w the whole world is dark. i\\'m more a part of it that way. not just one grotesque, ugly, deformed woman with a bandage around her face...with a special darkness that belongs to her.  the camera moves in for a very close shot of her bandaged face and now her voice is high, shrill, and unsteady.  janet (cont\\'d) i want 39 belon ! i want to be like other people. please help me, doctor. (now her voice catches in a sob) please help me.  the camera moves around so that it is shooting toward the doctor who stands in the shadows. he is silent for a moment and then his voice is soft.  doctor you‘re not alone, miss tyler. you realize that, don‘t you? you\\'re hardly alone. there are many others who share your misfortune. people who look much as you do. one of the alternatives...should this last treatment prove unsuccessful...well, this is simply to allow you to move into a special area in which people of your own kind have been congregated.  janet  people of my own kind!  (a pause) congregated, doctor? you don\\'t mean congregated, you mean segregated. you mean imprisoned. you\\'re talking about a ghetto now.  (and then plaintive,  anguished, and more  as a cry, she shrieks  this out) a ghetto designed for freaks!     doctor  (shouting) miss tyler! the state is not unsympathetic. your presence here in this hospital attests to this. it‘s doing all it can for you. but you\\'re not being rational, miss tyler. you can\\'t expect to live any kind of life amongst...  (again he gropes, but  picks it up quickly) amongst normal people.  cut to:  21. close shot janet the bandages twitch as if, underneath, her face were contorting.  janet  i could try. i could wear a mask or this bandage. i wouldn\\'t bother anyone. i\\'d just go my own way. i\\'d take a job. gny job.  (her voice breaks  again) who are you people anyway? what is this state? who makes up all the rules and the statutes and the traditions? the people who are different have to stay away from other people who are normal. the state isn\\'t god, doctor.     .lu.  doctor (firmly and obviously concerned) miss tyler, please!  janet the state is not god. it hasn\\'t the right to penalize people for an accident of birth. it hasn\\'t the right to make ugliness a crime—     doctor (shouting) miss tyler, i must ask you to stop this kind of talk immediately! 59w, miss tyler, now!  the camera moves back over to a shot of janet, who gets out of bed and stands there for a moment motionless with her head down, then very slowly, a hand out in front of her, she moves across the room over to a window. she touches it, then puts her bandaged cheek against it.  cut to:  22. reverse angle looking at her through the glass one hand moves down the pane until it reaches the open section at the bottom. she moves her hand back and forth.  jznet  (softly) i feel the night out there. i feel the air. i can smell the flowers.  (she turns slowly to  face the doctor.  both hands go up to  touch the bandage,  in a very small,  still voice) please take this off me. please take this off me.  (then screaming) take this 9:: me!  she starts to clutch and scrabble at the bandage, screaming as she does so.  abrupt cut to: 23. int. corridor room indicator on wall over reception desk  a light \"\"307\"\" flashes over and over again. in the b.g. we hear janet\\'s screaming voice pleading for the removal of the bandage. the nurse passes the camera hurriedly. camera pans around so that it is looking at her as she races down the corridor toward janet\\'s room.  abrupt cut to:  1.1..  24. int. hospital room as seen through the window from outside  the doctor is holding a fighting, squirming janet as the nurse barges in, takes her other arm and the two of them move her back over to the bed. the scene is played in pantomime and finally janet quiets down. we then see the nurse walk back over to the door and exit.  cut to: 25. int. corridor med. shot reception nurse  reading a magazine that covers up her face. janet‘s nurse walks in front of camera so that we see most of her back and part of the nurse sitting behind the magazine.  janet\\'s nurse the doctor\\'s decided to remove the bandages in 307. he wants to have the anesthetist stand by.  26. different angle the reception nurse she turns just at the moment of the camera cut so that we actually don\\'t see her face.  nurse two of course, it\\'s not for me to say, but i think they spend an awful lot of time and trouble on some of these face oases — these throwbacks: why not ship them out in the beginning?  she reaches for her magazine again and starts to turn in her chair, at which point  the camera again cuts to: 27. shot of her back looking over her shoulder. jhnet\\'s nurse is that what you\\'d want? if it were you? the second nurse flicks the intercom impatiently. nurse two anesthesia, please. wanted for 307. yes. she may get violent. fade to black-—end act one—-act two*—fade on: 28. int. corridor reception desk [night]  a nurse and an orderly lounge around, backs to camera. the orderly looks at his watch, then across at a large television  .ll-  set perched on the far end of the counter which fronts the reception desk.  orderly leader‘s speaking tonight. goes on in just a few minutes.  he rises, flicks on the set, then lights a cigarette.  29. top hat shot the match as it goes into the ashtray. directly across on a direct line is the front of the television set which shows an extremely long shot of a desk with an official seal behind it. a man sits behind it, too far off to distinguish clearly beyond a general outline. an off—camera voice announces portentously.  announcer and now, ladies and gentlemen, our leader.  there is cheering and offstage applause, and we now hear the stentorian tones of the gentleman just announced.  leader\\'s voice good evening, ladies and gentlemen. tonight i shall talk to you about glorious conformity...about the delight and the ultimate pleasure of our unified society. you recall, of course, that directionless, unproductive, over-sentimentalized era of man\\'s history when it was assumed that dissent was some kind of natural and healthy adjunct to society. we also recall that during this period of time there was a strange over—sentimentalized concept that it mattered not that people were different, that ideas were at variance with one another, that a world could exist in some kind of crazy, patchwork kind of makeup, with foreign elements glued together in a crazy quilt. we realize, of course, now, that...  his voice continues underneath as the camera moves away from him and shoots down the hall. the leader\\'s voice continues through the bandage—removal scene. 30. different angle the door of janet\\'s room  dissolve to: 31. int. hospital room night  janet now sits in a chair in the center of the room. a single overhead light has been turned on so that she alone is  j.j-  illuminated almost as if by a spotlight. there\\'s a low murmur of voices underneath as other shadowy figures in the room walk back and forth in front of her, their shadows playing briefly on her bandaged face as they move. behind this scene, intermittently, we can hear the voice of the leader on the television set outside. then the voices of the doctor and  the people in the room die off. the doctor\\'s body steps in front of the camera. camera pans down to a shot of his right hand. it holds a scissors.  doctor now i have to ask you once again, miss tyler. i must insist that you promise to remain rational. no tantrums. no temperament. and no violence. you understand?  janet nods.  doctor (cont\\'d) now i\\'ll tell you precisely what i\\'m going to do. i\\'m going to cut the bandage at a point on the left side of your head. i\\'ll start to unwind the bandage very gradually. the process has to be slow so that you can become accustomed to the light. as you know, the injections may have had an effect on your vision. now as i unwrap, i want you to keep your eyes open and i want you to describe to me the different shading of light as you perceive it as each layer of bandage comes off.  janet (softly) all right.  32. different angle profile shot janet we see the doctor\\'s body from the neck down, the scissors now held in front of him.  doctor now if you make any movement or if you start getting emotional on us, miss tyler, i\\'m going to have to have the nurses hold you down and have the anesthetist put you under sedation. is that understood?  janet (falteringly) i promise...i won\\'t.  doctor all right then.  j_‘l-  the scissors come out in front of him and move toward the camera. from this angle they are disproportionately large and almost fill the screen. we see them perform some movement and the bandages start to move in sections across the screen as if being unwound from a head.  doctor (cont\\'d) do you see any light new, miss tyler?  janet just a little. it looks...it looks gray.  doctor  all right now, just be very quiet. again bandage swirls across the screen and then stops.  doctor (cont\\'d) now, miss tyler?  janet much brighter. very bright.  doctor look up toward the light.  cut to:  33. angle shot looking up toward light a diffuse sun as seen through layers of bandage.  34. reverse angle over the doctor\\'s shoulder looking down toward janet\\'s face as once again he starts to unwrap bandage.  doctor (cont\\'d) how about now, miss tyler?  janet it\\'s bright. it\\'s very bright.  doctor good. (he continues to unwrap then stops) i‘m at the last layer now, miss tyler.  janet\\'s face goes up.  janet i can...i can just distinguish your outline. just vaguely...but i can see you.  doctor now i‘m going to remove the last bandage, miss tyler. now do you want a mirror?  .de there\\'s a silence.  janet no. no, thank you. no mirror.  again she looks up as if trying to scan the faces of the others in the room.  35. pan shot past the faces of the anesthetist, and two nurses in the shadows as they watch motionlessly and tensely.  36. different angle janet as seen from the back of her head. the doctor once again reaches for the last of the bandages.  doctor now i\\'m going to remove the last bandage, miss tyler. and i want you to remember this please. miss tyler? are you listening?  janet yes, i\\'m listening.  doctor we have done all we could. if we were successful - all well and good. there are no problems. if, however, this final treatment has not achieved the desired results, keep in mind that you can still live a long and fruitful life among people of your own kind. as soon as we discover these results, we\\'ll either release you...or...  he pauses for a moment.  37. another pan shot past the shadowy faces of the other people in the room, winding up on a shot of janet’s thinly bandaged face through which we can now see the outline of her features, eyes, nose, mouth, but no definitive portrait of a face.  janet doctor?  doctor yes.  jinet  if i\\'m still...if i\\'m still terribly ugly, is there any other alternative? could i...could i be put away?  doctor under certain circumstances, miss tyler...the state does provide for (more)  doctor (cont\\'d) extermination of undesirables. there are many factors to be considered, though, that bear on the decision. under the circumstances, considering your age...your general physical condition...i doubt very much if we could permit anything but your transfer to a communal group of people with your...your disability.  janet you‘ll make me go then?  doctor that will probably be the case. all right, miss tyler. remain very quiet please. keep your eyes open.  38. different angle from behind the doctor as he reaches forward and starts to unwind the last bandage. the first strip of bandage comes off the top of her forehead, another layer revealing her forehead, another layer uncovering just the upper part of her eyebrows and eyes.  doctor (cont\\'d) all right, miss tyler. now here comes the last of it. i wish you every good luck!  again he reaches over and starts to unwind as we  cut to:  39. shadowy faces of the other people in the room  there‘s a moment‘s absolute silence, then one of the nurses lets out a gasp. another involuntarily throws a hand and arm across her face to blot out what is obviously an incredible spectacle.  40. flash close shot doctor\\'s hand as he drops the scissors and they land on the floor. he then steps back into the shadows to stand close to the others.  doctor‘s voice no change! no change at all!  41. closeup janet she raises her head. if she is not startlingly beautiful, we have missed our point entirely.  42. different angle from behind janet  as she slowly rises. her hands come up from her side to touch her face, then remain there as her head bends over and she buries her face in her hands. in the silence we hear one rasping sob that is finally and painfully controlled. then she looks up, scanning the faces that confront her, then  .llo  suddenly she breaks away and races toward the door. the doctor hurriedly and expertly steps in front of her way and grabs her.  doctor (curtly to the other man in the room) needle, please. i was afraid of this. (then to the nurse) turn on the lights!  the shadowy form of the nurse moves over to the light switch. 43. close shot her hand as she turns on the switch.  44.—47. abrupt flash closeups of the two nurses, the anesthetist, and then the doctor each face is more grotesque than the other. noses, eyes, mouths, ears, everything, almost as if they were cartoons; almost as if they were caricature drawings come to life.  48. med. close shot the anesthetist a syringe in his hand, as he walks slowly toward the struggling girl whose face is buried against the doctor. he holds up the needle and at this moment janet breaks free, opens the door wildly and races out into the corridor.  49. long shot as she races down the corridor past amazed nurses and doctors, each of whom has the same odd ugliness of those we have already seen.  50. close shot door of janet\\'s room as the doctor barges out.  doctor (cont\\'d) (shouts) stop that patient! stop her!  51.-53. series of shots of janet as she races down empty corridors.  54. close shot elevator operator he opens the doors to the elevator just as janet passes. he, like all the others, is a cartoon—looking character.  55. close shot doctor coming out of operating room, removing his mask just as janet runs by him. his face is like that of the elevator operator.  (the following covers janet\\'s running through the corridor.)  leader\\'s voice i say to you now...i say to you now that there is no such thing as a permissive society, because such a society cannot exist!  (more)  leader\\'s voice (cont\\'d) they will scream at you and rant and rave and conjure up some dead and decadent picture of an ancient time when they said that all men are created equal! but to them equality was an equality of opportunity, an equality of status, an equality of aspiration! and then, in what must surely be the pinnacle of insanity, the absolute in inconsistency, they would have had us believe that this equality did not apply to form, to creed. they permitted a polyglot, accident-bred, mongrel—like mass of diversification to blanket the earth, to infiltrate and weaken!  (now he shrieks) well, we know now that there must be a single purpose! a single norm! a single approach! a single entity of peoples! a single virtue! a single morality! a_single frame of reference! a single philosophy of government! (shrieking again)  we cannot permit...we must not permit the encroaching sentimentality of a past age to weaken our resolve. we must cut out all that is different like a cancerous growth:     56. running shot janet as she races down the corridor.  57.-59. different angles television screens as she runs by them. each with a different angle of the face of the leader as he continues to speak, his voice droning, unintelligible, but persistent and gradually taking on a build of excitement.  60. different angle janet as she stops in the middle of an empty hall and looks left, right, in front and then back.  cut to: 61.—63. interspersed shots of the television screen  as each shot shows it in larger and larger perspective. the face of the leader is incredibly ugly as it shouts down at her.  64. zoom in to close shot janet‘s back as her hands go to the sides of her head, as if trying to shut out the noises.  65. long angle shot looking down as she races down the last corridor and turns a corner then stops dead. whip pan up to giant television screen. the leader\\'s face fills it up entirely, screaming, ranting, contorting.  j.j-  66. close shot janet\\'s hand as she instinctively reaches for an ashtray near a bench which is against one wall.  67. different angle as she picks it up and flings it across the corridor.  68. extremely tight close shot television screen the ashtray hits the face of the leader head on and splinters the set, and from the broken, smoking remnant of the machine, we hear the voice of the leader.  leader\\'s voice (cont\\'d) it is essential in this society that we not only have a norm, but that we conform to that norm. differences weaken us. variations destroy us. an incredible permissiveness to deviation from this norm is what has ended nations and brought them to their knees. conformity we must worship and hold sacred. conformity is the key to survival.  the voice persists as we cut to:  69. different angle janet as she races down the corridor past the screen.  70. close shot double doors unlabled, as janet runs in and smashes through them.  71. int. room med. shot  janet bursts in and recoils in shock and horror at something she sees o.s. she shrieks and slides slowly down to the ground in a huddled heap and begins to cry. the camera moves down. the legs and feet of whatever monstrosity she has seen move into f.g. janet is terrified. then the doctor enters from another direction and bends down to her soothingly.  doctor don\\'t be afraid, miss tyler. this is a representative of the group you\\'re to live with. oddly enough, you\\'ve come right to him. come on now — he won\\'t hurt you.  he lifts the terrified girl to her feet. 72. closeup janet  forces herself to look at the newcomer, her face full of revulsion.  lu.  73. full shot walter smith steps into the light. we see a youthful, tremendously attractive young man, dressed plainly in simple trousers and shirt.  doctor (cont\\'d) this is mr. smith, janet. walter smith. he\\'s in charge of the village group in the north. he\\'ll take you there tonight. you can live among your own kind now.  74. different angle smith as he walks over to janet. we\\'re looking across her back and up into smith\\'s face. in addition to being attractive, it\\'s a gentle face, a compassionate face, an infinitely kind face. he smiles, his voice is gentle and soft.  smith miss tyler?  the girl\\'s head is raised.  smith (cont\\'d) we have a lovely village and wonderful people. i think you\\'ll like it where i\\'m going to take you. you\\'ll be with your own kind, and after a little while — you‘d be amazed how little a while — you\\'ll feel a sense of great belonging. you\\'ll feel a sense of being loved. and you will be loved, miss tyler.  the girl remains motionless now. smith looks up and gestures with his head.  75. different angle the room as the doctor leaves and shuts the door behind him.  76. close shot smith  smith (cont\\'d) miss tyler? would you get your things now? we can leave any time.  the camera starts a very, very slow arc until finally it is shooting directly into the face of janet tyler. she\\'s like a beautiful living portrait. a face carved into the mold of all things woman. gentle, beautiful, feminine, and young.  janet mr. smith?  smith yes?  l;-  janet why...why are some of us born so ugly?  smith  (smiles sadly) i don\\'t know, miss tyler. i really don\\'t know.  (a pause) but do you know something? it doesn\\'t really matter. there\\'s an old saying...a very, very old saying. beauty is in the eye of the beholder. when we leave here...when we go to the village...keep that in mind. try, miss tyler. say it over and over in your mind. beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  (a pause as he takes  her hand) come on, now. we‘ll get your things and we\\'ll leave.  the two of them walk to the double doors. he opens them for her and they walk out into the corridor, a vast empty passageway that stretches out almost to infinity. the camera remains stationary as they walk away from it down the corridor.  serling\\'s voice  now the questions that come to mind: where is this place and when is it? what kind of world, where ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation from that norm? you want an answer? the answer is...it doesn\\'t make any difference. because the old saying happens to be true. beauty is in the eye of the beholder. in this year or a hundred years hence.  (a pause) on this planet...or wherever there is human life, perhaps out amongst the stars.  (a pause) beauty is in the eye of the beholder. lesson to be learned...in the twilight zone.     fade to black.  \"\\r\\n8|Twilight Zone|The Howling Man|November 4, 1960|\"the twilight zone \"\"the howling man\"\" written by charles beaumont  \\x0cact one int. ellington\\'s room - night fade in and pan down to a dark and stormy night. a man looks out of an open window at the storm and then turns to reveal his anguished face. this is david ellington -- grim, wild-eyed, graying around the temples -- as he addresses some unseen person urgently, amid the roar of thunder, the howl of the wind, and the patter of rain. ellington i know. it\\'s -- it\\'s an incredible story. i, of all people, know this. and you won\\'t believe me. no, not at first. but i\\'m going to tell you the whole thing. then, you will believe, because you must. you must believe. it happened many years ago, after the first world war. i was on a walking trip through central europe. but one night, i... one night, i got lost in a storm. ellington turns back to the open window just over his shoulder where the storm rages. dissolve to: ext. the castle a similar stormy night, decades earlier. a flashback to central europe, where an imposing, ornate, medieval castle looms out of the darkness. a younger david ellington staggers through the blinding rain to the huge wooden door of the castle and knocks. a heavily-accented voice from behind the door answers. christophorus yes? who is it? the door swings open to reveal brother christophorus, a bearded giant in robes, carrying a long wooden staff and an ancient lantern. ellington please, please let me in. i\\'m lost.  \\x0cchristophorus i\\'m sorry. we don\\'t allow visitors in the hermitage. ellington oh, i-i-i-i\\'m not a visitor. i-i\\'m a stranger here. i-i got lost. ellington tries to enter but christophorus blocks the way with his staff. ellington oh, you don\\'t understand. i\\'m lost. christophorus looks ellington over warily and with a barely perceptible nod, clears the way for him to unsteadily enter, and closes the door behind him. cut to: int. entry hall the castle\\'s torch-lit entry hall, primitive, like something out of the middle ages. a soaked, shivering ellington, clutching a traveling bag, looks the entry hall over as christophorus leads him through it. other men, dressed like christophorus and carrying staffs, appear in adjacent doorways, staring at ellington. ellington, already weak, suddenly grows dizzy, staggers against a stone doorway, and has a coughing fit. christophorus turns to look at him. ellington i-i\\'ll be all right once i dry out. christophorus wait here. i have to speak to brother jerome. christophorus disappears through a doorway as ellington drops his traveling bag and puts his back to the doorway, trying to regain his composure. his eyes widen at the sound of a wicked howl. is it a wolf? is he dreaming? the storm continues to rage. ellington looks around for the source of the howling as christophorus returns.  \\x0cchristophorus brother jerome will see you now. a puzzled ellington reacts to another evil-sounding howl. ellington what was that? christophorus the wind. come. unconvinced, ellington gives christophorus a long look before they proceed. int. office christophorus leads ellington into what passes for an office. seated at an ancient wooden desk before huge windows that reveal the ongoing storm is brother jerome -- flowing white hair and beard and robes, very much like moses -- a commanding presence even while sitting. jerome glances at christophorus and then at ellington. jerome why have you come here? ellington my-my name is ellington. i-i\\'m on a walking trip. i got lost in the storm. ellington has another coughing fit. he is clearly in bad shape, and getting worse. ellington excuse me. i saw light here. jerome what do you want from us? ellington shelter. maybe some food. jerome shakes his head sorrowfully.  \\x0cjerome we cannot help you. you will have to leave. (rises majestically) now, mr. ellington. now. in disbelief, a silent ellington slowly turns and staggers out of the office. int. entry hall but the effort becomes too much for him. ellington collapses and passes out. jerome, christophorus and the other men gather around him, making no move to help. an omniscient narrator has a few things to say about this. narrator (voice over) the prostrate form of mr. david ellington, scholar, seeker of truth and, regrettably, finder of truth. a man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time.... an image of the narrator, in suit and tie, hands folded before him, magically appears over the scene, as he finishes his comments. narrator ... a man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary and found instead the outer edges of the twilight zone. fade out int. entry hall fade in on a now-conscious ellington in the empty entry hall, later that night. he touches his brow and unsteadily crosses to an ornate window to look out at the still raging storm. no one else is present. at the sound of more howling, ellington turns and follows the noise. he staggers along, occasionally leaning against a wooden beam or doorway for support until he comes to a wooden door, held shut by a staff similar to the ones carried by jerome, christophorus, and the other men. he approaches it cautiously and peers through the barred window in the door.  \\x0cit is a prison cell. ellington sees a man whose back is turned towards him -- it is the howling man, gaunt, dirty and dressed in rags. but as the howling man turns, sees ellington, and rushes to him, he reveals a gentle, bearded face and a gentle voice. the howling man reaches through the barred window and clutches ellington\\'s shoulder. ellington tries to pull away. the howling man help me. no, please. in the name of mercy, help me. you\\'re not one of them. ellington no. my name\\'s ellington. i\\'m an american. the howling man (releases his grip) sshh! we have only moments. come closer. come. ellington does so. the howling man they\\'re mad, mister ellington. all of them. raving mad. listen. i was in the village in schwartzof. i was walking in the street with my woman. we paused to rest by a tree. and we kissed. is it wrong to kiss? tell me. ellington i-i don\\'t think so. the howling man of course, you don\\'t. you don\\'t think so, i don\\'t think so. but jerome -- the lecherous old fool -- we looked up and i saw him standing close by. i tried to open my mouth to speak but before i could utter a sound, he raised that heavy staff he carries -you\\'ve seen it? -- and he hit me, again and again. ellington why?  \\x0cthe howling man for revenge. because she refused his advances. he took his fury out on me. ellington i-i\\'m sorry. i find this difficult to believe. the howling man of course, you do, mister ellington. that\\'s the strength of the man. he makes his madness seem a harmless thing. the-the-the madness of a religious zealot. this is not a religious order, mister ellington. these so-called brothers of truth -- they\\'re outcasts, misfits, cut off from the world because the world won\\'t have them. mister ellington, please, you must believe me. i don\\'t say they\\'re evil. i say they\\'re mad. ellington starts to walk away. the howling man grabs him by the shoulder. the howling man where\\'re you going? ellington i\\'ll speak to jerome. the howling man noooo. he\\'s the greatest maniac of them all. ellington then, how can i help you? a deep voice rings out. jerome mister ellington! jerome, christophorus, and a few others stand a few feet away. ellington approaches them.  \\x0cjerome i did not know that you were well enough to walk. come with me, please. ellington i-i must talk with you. jerome (pointing) this way. the other men watch as jerome and ellington silently head back to jerome\\'s office. the storm grows worse. christophorus gives the howling man\\'s cell a long look. cut to: int. office jerome and ellington enter. jerome i must ask you to leave the hermitage, mister ellington. we have no facilities for the care of the ill. arrangements can be made at schwartzof -ellington now, just a minute... jerome no, not a minute, not another second, mister ellington. now! ellington why? jerome i\\'ve already explained that. ellington no, you\\'ve explained nothing. jerome shuts the door.  \\x0cellington no one asked me to come here. i realize that. but that\\'s no excuse for your behavior. jerome my son... ellington i\\'m not your son. jerome you don\\'t understand. ellington that\\'s right. i-i don\\'t. so why don\\'t you tell me? why are you in such a hurry to have me leave? what are you afraid i\\'ll find out? it\\'s the man you have locked up in the cell, isn\\'t it, brother? well, that isn\\'t a secret anymore. i know about him. jerome what man is this, mister ellington? ellington the one we just left. the one who\\'s been screaming his head off. jerome i\\'m not sure you know what you\\'re saying. ellington, growing dizzy, takes a seat. ellington look, brother, i -- i don\\'t know much about this cult of yours, what\\'s permitted, what isn\\'t permitted. i seriously doubt if you have the authority to imprison a man against his will. jerome that is quite true. we have no such authority.  \\x0cellington then why have you done it? jerome no man has ever been imprisoned in the hermitage, mister ellington. ellington i was just talking with him. jerome you talked to no man. you have been very ill, mister ellington. you\\'ve suffered delirium. jerome puts a sympathetic hand on ellington\\'s shoulder just as a piercing howl causes ellington to bolt out of his chair. he backs away from jerome. ellington oh, no. don\\'t tell me you didn\\'t hear that. honest men make unconvincing liars. a wicked clap of thunder punctuates the comment. ellington i\\'ll find out eventually, you know. jerome what do you mean? ellington just what i said. the police will be very interested to learn that you\\'re keeping a man imprisoned here -jerome i tell you, there is no man. ellington all right, all right. just... forget it. jerome watches with concern as ellington crosses to the door, opens it, and starts to leave.  \\x0cjerome mister ellington. ellington stops and turns. ellington yes? jerome would you really go to the police? ellington would you? another clap of thunder. jerome very well. i told you the truth but only part of it. now, i see i shall have to tell you the whole truth. shut the door, mister ellington. ellington shuts the door just as a particularly long, sad howl causes jerome to wince and put his hand to his ears. ellington looks relieved. ellington then you do hear it. jerome as i have heard it every hour of every day for five long years. jerome crosses to the window. ellington why did you lie? jerome i didn\\'t. when i told you that no man howled at the hermitage, i was being perfectly honest. what you saw is not a man. it is the devil himself! this rates two claps of thunder and a fade out on jerome\\'s ominous, lightning-lit face.  \\x0cend of act one  \\x0cact two int. office fade in on jerome, still at the window, moments later. jerome yes, the devil himself. what you saw in the cell is satan, otherwise known as the dark angel, ahriman, asmodeus, belial, diabolus, the devil. you asked for the truth. now you have it. you do believe me, don\\'t you? ellington ah, sure. of course. ellington starts backing away from a wild-eyed jerome who rants on. jerome no. now, it is you who are lying, mister ellington. you don\\'t believe me at all. quite to the contrary. you\\'re now quite certain of what you suspected, that i am mad. sit down, mister ellington. and we\\'ll see. ellington sits. jerome let me tell you a story and we\\'ll see how certain you are that i am mad. how certain you are of anything. jerome walks away from ellington and begins pacing around the room through the following: jerome i suppose you fancy yourself a sophisticated man. you consider us to be primitive because we live here in solitude, away from the so-called real world. we are misfits. ellington oh, no, no.  \\x0cjerome oh, please. i know all the theories. ellington i assure you, brother, that-jerome no, mister ellington, it is i who am assuring you that i am not the ignorant fanatic i would appear. oh, i coped with your world for forty years, and rather successfully, at that. the best schools, a degree in philosophy, a job that took me to the ends of the earth. this beard, this staff, and this faith are merely the results of a different point of view. if you can understand that, you can listen to what i have to say with an open mind. another wicked howl unnerves ellington, but jerome takes it in stride. jerome five years ago, there were no howls in the hermitage. it was simply the bombed-out ruin of an old castle belonging to the family wulfran. baron wulfran gave it to the brotherhood of truth as a gesture of charity. our job was to tend the vineyards and save what souls we could by constant prayer. ellington but this isn\\'t a religious order, is it, brother? jerome we feel that we are recognized by god. truth is our dogma. we believe it to be man\\'s greatest weapon against the devil, who is the father of all lies. ellington rises.  \\x0cellington all right, go on with your story. you were tending the vineyards. jerome at that time, shortly after the great war, the world was in chaos. everywhere was unhappiness. except in this little village below. jerome points a finger toward a rain-streaked window. jerome for some reason the people of schwartzof refused to yield to despair. they lost none of their faith. they continued as they had been for centuries. honest, god-fearing, and happy. this village was a plum to satan, one he could not resist. so, he came here and embarked upon a program of corruption. ellington but you stopped him. jerome yes! you see, mister ellington... a quick clap of thunder for punctuation. as jerome approaches ellington ominously. jerome ... he made the same mistake that you have made. he underestimated me. he thought he would have no difficulty in tempting the old fool. ellington backs away and sits again. jerome but i had him in a cell before he knew what happened.  \\x0cellington but, if he\\'s the devil, how do you keep him locked up? jerome with the staff of truth! a wild-eyed jerome flourishes his staff above his head dramatically and then lowers it. jerome the one barrier he cannot pass. ellington tell me, how did you recognize him? he doesn\\'t look evil. jerome the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape. i had seen him before, in all parts of the world. in all forms and guises. wherever there was sin. wherever there was strife. wherever there was corruption. and persecution. there he was also. sometimes he was only a spectator, a face in the crowd. but, always, he was there. jerome pounds his staff on the floor insistently. all this is too much for ellington who again grows dizzy, swaying in his chair. jerome now... you see, i hope, why you must say nothing of what you\\'ve seen and heard here. ellington rises again. ellington brother... not that i doubt you, you understand, only... well, isn\\'t it possible you might have made a mistake? jerome no! think, mister ellington. think of the peace of the world these last five years. think of this country now. (more)  \\x0cjerome (cont\\'d) is there another like it? ellington you haven\\'t put an end to-to suffering. there\\'s still murders, robberies. even now while we\\'re talking, people are starving. jerome the suffering man was meant to endure. we cause most of our own grief. we need no help from him. it is the unnatural catastrophe, the great wars, the overwhelming pestilences, the wholesale sinning that we have stopped. ellington i believe you, brother. jerome do you truly? ellington yes. i-i admit i was doubtful at first but you\\'ve convinced me. absolutely. i-i promise to keep your secret. jerome good, my son. tomorrow, if you feel well enough, you may leave. jerome crosses to the door and opens it for ellington. jerome in the meantime, brother christophorus will look after you. ellington starts out the door. jerome please. go directly to his room. ellington good night, brother. int. outside the howling man\\'s cell ellington, sick and dizzy, rubs his stiff neck as he makes  \\x0chis way to the howling man\\'s cell. ellington grins when he sees the man\\'s scared, hopeful face in the barred window. the howling man he lied to you, didn\\'t he? i can see that. what\\'d he say? ellington he said that you were the devil. the howling man (nearly laughs) the devil! that\\'s good. that\\'s wonderful. what a dream for an old devil, to catch the devil and lock him up. (suddenly concerned) you don\\'t believe him, do you? ellington no, of course not. the howling man then help me. ellington look, why don\\'t i just go get the authorities? the howling man it would be my death warrant. the authorities would return and find nothing. jerome is mad, but he\\'s shrewd, too. a hand appears on ellington\\'s shoulder. he turns to see it belongs to brother christophorus. christophorus (politely) brother jerome was fearful you might lose your way. come. christophorus leads ellington away. the howling man watches them go, a mixture of hope and fear in his face. cut to:  \\x0cint. christophorus\\' room moments later, christophorus enters with ellington and shuts the door behind them. christophorus starts to put a key in the lock but ellington grabs his arm. ellington why are you locking the door? christophorus (as if it were obvious) to protect you. rest now, mister ellington. (locks the door) remember, you\\'re still a very sick man. dissolve to: int. christophorus\\' room later that night. as christophorus sleeps, ellington carefully steals the key chain from around his neck. collecting his coat, ellington stealthily unlocks the door, opens it, exits, closes it, and then takes one last look at the sleeping christophorus through the door\\'s window before hurrying away. cut to: int. outside the howling man\\'s cell a weakened, dizzy ellington approaches. the howling man you\\'ve come. good. ellington what do you want me to do? the howling man lift off the wooden bolt. ellington looks at the wooden staff that bolts the door shut. it appears easily removable and well within the howling man\\'s reach.  \\x0cellington (astonished) is this all that holds you in? the howling man yes. lift it off. ellington (confused) why haven\\'t you done it yourself? the howling man please. there\\'s no time for talk. mister ellington, in the name of mercy -- if you fail now, they\\'ll kill both of us. don\\'t you understand that? cut to: int. christophorus\\' room christophorus awakes with a start, sees that the keys and ellington have vanished, rises and crosses to the door. it\\'s locked. cut to: int. outside the howling man\\'s cell ellington starts to remove the staff. he is suddenly having serious doubts. he lets go of the staff. the howling man hurry. hurry. cut to: int. christophorus\\' room christophorus pounds on the door and yells. christophorus stop! stop! stop! stop! cut to:  \\x0cint. outside the howling man\\'s cell ellington, hearing the yells, panics and quickly removes the staff. the cell door slowly swings open and there is a horrific moment of uncertainty as the howling man steps out, a wide grin on his face. ellington hands him his coat. ellington put this on, the storm. the howling man drapes the coat over his shoulders as ellington looks around nervously. ellington is about to lead him to safety when, to the accompaniment of a long roll of thunder, the howling man points a bony finger at ellington\\'s back, whereupon ellington instantly loses control of his body and collapses to the floor. after a sidelong glance to assure himself that his captors are too late, the howling man allows a dark look to cross his face. his features begin to subtly change. he smiles, strokes his beard, and strides off. a prostrate ellington watches in horror as, with every step, the howling man slowly transforms himself into a hideous horned demon. the coat draped over his shoulders transforms into a cloak. when at last the devil reaches the wall opposite his cell, he turns back to ellington, wraps the cloak about himself, smiles grimly, and disappears in a puff of smoke. a stunned ellington passes out. jerome and christophorus arrive. jerome peers into the empty cell while christophorus glances sympathetically at ellington. jerome and christophorus exchange looks. christophorus walks off while jerome crosses to ellington, now regaining consciousness. jerome puts an arm around him. jerome i\\'m sorry for you, my son. all your life, you will remember this night. and you\\'ll know, mister ellington, whom you have turned loose upon the world. ellington i-i didn\\'t believe you. i saw him and didn\\'t recognize him.  \\x0cjerome that is man\\'s weakness... and satan\\'s strength. ellington stares hard in the direction of the devil\\'s escape. ellington (voice over) in that moment, i decided to spend the rest of my life tracking him down. to recapture the evil i\\'d released. dissolve to: ext. the castle a view of the castle in the storm that night. ellington (voice over) the evil that soon took the shape of the second world war, the korean war, the hideous new weapons of war. i swore i\\'d find him again, as brother jerome had done. dissolve to: int. ellington\\'s room a very small version of the wooden staff of truth as it keeps a 1960s-style door shut. ellington (voice over) it took many years but i did it. see? i have him in there now. a hand gestures toward the door. the hand belongs to ellington -- he appears now as he did in the first scene: older and grayer and as wild-eyed as brother jerome. he turns and crosses to his housekeeper. ellington has been telling his story to her, apparently in a room of ellington\\'s house.  \\x0cellington you understand now. you understand why you must not under any circumstances go near that door. you see how important it is that he stay locked up? the housekeeper looks at him as if he\\'s crazy but nods her assent. ellington good. i\\'m sending him back to brother jerome. he\\'ll do a bit of howling but, heh, pay no attention to that. it\\'s a trick. i know. yes, i must go now. ellington crosses to his raincoat and puts it on. ellington must go. i-i have preparations to make. ii\\'ll be back in just a few minutes. ellington grabs his hat and heads for the door. the storm continues. he pauses and turns back to the housekeeper. ellington (gravely) remember. remember. keep that door locked. ellington leaves, shutting the door behind him. the housekeeper turns and stares for a long moment at the bolted door in disbelief -- until a wicked, piercing howl emerges from the other side. startled, she crosses to the door and hesitantly removes the wooden staff. narrator (voice over) ancient folk saying: \"\"you can catch the devil, but you can\\'t hold him long.\"\" ... the housekeeper turns the knob and opens the door. narrator (voice over) ... ask brother jerome. ask david ellington. ... the door swings open to reveal part of the darkened,  \\x0cshadowy room on the other side. narrator (voice over) ... they know, and they\\'ll go on knowing to the end of their days... and beyond... in the twilight zone. pan up, dissolve to and fade out on a starry night sky. the end  \\x0c \"\\r\\n9|Twilight Zone|The Lonely|November 13, 1959|\"107: \"\"the lonely\"\" written by rod serling  \\x0cact one ext. sky [night] shot of the sky... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp, sparkling relief. as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens -narrator\\'s voice (o.s.) there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. it is a dimension as vast as space and timeless as infinity. it is the middle ground between light and shadow -- between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man\\'s fears and the summit of his knowledge. this is the dimension of imagination. it is an area which we call the twilight zone. the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot. we are now looking at an empty patch of desert, an arid, dull nondescript piece of land, its monotony broken only by an occasional scrubby, dying cactus, and a few sand dunes that shift nervously and sporadically in a wind that provides the only motion and the only sound to an otherwise stagnant scene. the camera pans left very slowly until it is on a -long shot a cottage that sits alone in the desert. this is a ramshackle, tworoom affair made of corrugated steel, driftwood and other nondescript material. alongside is a beat-up vintage 1930\\'s sedan. beyond and behind this is a tiny tool shed that houses a small generator. a limp wire extends from the shed to the shack. narrator\\'s voice (over the pan) witness, if you will, a dungeon, made out of mountains, salt flats, and sand that stretch to infinity. the dungeon has an inmate, james a. corry. and this is his residence, a metal shack. (more)  \\x0cnarrator\\'s voice (cont\\'d) an old touring car that squats in the sun and goes nowhere -- for there is nowhere to go. at this point we see corry come out of the house. he\\'s dressed in jeans and a threadbare shirt. he looks up toward the pale sky and the strange, sick, white gleam of the sun, shades his eyes, walks over toward the car and stops, looks at it, touches it with his hand, then leans against it and stares once again toward the horizon. medium close shot across the car looking at corry. he\\'s a man in his early forties of medium height, perhaps a little more muscular than most men. his face was once a strong face; it is no longer. there is no will left and no resolve. what we see on it now is resignation; a sense of dull, pervading hopelessness. he rather aimlessly opens the car door and leaving it open, slides in to sit in the driver\\'s seat and look out the front windshield. the camera moves around so that it\\'s shooting through the front windshield toward him. close shot corry as he gets out of the car and stares across toward the horizon. narrator\\'s voice for the record let it be known that james a. corry is a convicted criminal placed in solitary confinement. confinement in this case stretches as far as the eye can see, because this particular dungeon is on an asteroid nine million miles from the earth. the camera pans slowly up toward the sky to where we see a shot of the earth. narrator\\'s voice now witness, if you will, a man\\'s mind and body shriveling in the sun, a man dying of loneliness.  \\x0cmed. shot corry corry, shoulders slumped walking in a kind of draggy, aimless shuffle, goes back toward the shack and walks inside. cut to: int. shack full shot the room the inside, like the exterior, is makeshift and looks temporary. the furniture is made out of packing cases. there\\'s an aged wind-up victrola, an icebox. the bed is disheveled and dirty. he walks over to a small rickety table, takes out a dog-eared ledger, opens it and rifles through the pages slowly and rather aimlessly. then he takes a pencil, sits down, and starts to write. the camera moves in very slowly as he voices aloud that which he is writing. corry\\'s voice entry, fifteenth day, sixth month... the year four. and all the days and the months and the years the same. (a pause. now he sits as he writes) there\\'ll be a supply ship coming in soon. i think. they\\'re either due or overdue, and i hope it\\'s allenby\\'s ship because he\\'s a decent man and he brings things for me. (he stops writing for a moment, looks down at the ledger, then continues to write) like he brought in the parts to that antique automobile. i was a year putting that thing together -- such as it is. a whole year putting an old car together. (a pause) but thank god for that car and for the hours it used up and the days and the weeks. i can look at it out there and i know it\\'s real and reality is what i need. because what is there left that i can believe in? the desert and the wind? the silence? (more)  \\x0ccorry\\'s voice (cont\\'d) or myself -- can i believe in myself anymore? (another pause) disjointed thought... a little crazy... but maybe i\\'ll become like that car. inanimate. just an item sitting in the sand -- and then would i feel loneliness? would i feel misery? i wonder... he slowly lets the pencil drop out of his fingers, looks down at the book. his eyes close, then he slumps forward burying his face in his arms, leaning against the table. dissolve to: ext. shack [day] through the window we can see corry sleeping, still by the table. there\\'s the distant roaring sound of engines, a flash of light that shines against the side of the shack and enters the window. we see corry start, and rise and race to the door, flinging it open, peering out over the landscape. cut to: ext. desert long shot a group of three men dressed in simple uniforms not unlike pilots of today. the camera stays directly on them as they approach. into the frame from behind the camera comes corry, who is racing out to meet them. his fingers clench and unclench at his side. he takes a few fast stumbling steps toward them, then thinking better of it stops and then, giving in again, runs toward them again. close shot as they suddenly meet a few feet from one another. the head of the space group stops. this is allenby, a man in his fifties. he nods a little curtly. allenby how are you, corry?  \\x0ccorry all right. there\\'s a silence now. adams, one of the other two spacemen, looks around. adams quite a place you got here, corry. corry i\\'m so glad you like it. adams i didn\\'t say i liked it. i think it stinks. corry you don\\'t have to live here now, do you? adams no, but i\\'ve got to come back here four times a year. and that\\'s eight months out of twelve, corry, away from earth. sometimes my kids don\\'t even recognize me when i come home. corry (very simply) i\\'m sorry. adams (with a look) i\\'ll bet you are! but you\\'ve got it made, don\\'t you. corry? makes for simple living, doesn\\'t it? (he bends down and picks up a handful of sand) this is corry\\'s kingdom. (he lets the sand run through his fingers) right here. six thousand miles north to south. four thousand miles east to west -and all of its just like this! the camera is on corry\\'s face now. he wets his lips. he wants to say something with desperate urgency. allenby sees the look, looks away a little uncomfortably for a moment.  \\x0callenby we\\'ve only got a fifteen-minute layover, corry. corry wets his lips and tries to keep the supplication out of his voice. corry nobody\\'s checking your schedule out here. why don\\'t we have a game of cards or something? allenby (shakes his head) i\\'m sorry, corry. this isn\\'t an arbitrary decision. if we delay our time of departure any more than fifteen minutes, that places us in a different orbital position. we\\'d never make it back to earth. we\\'d have to stay here at least fourteen days before this place was in position again. corry so, fourteen days? why not have us a ball? i\\'ve got some beer i\\'ve saved. we could play some cards, tell me what\\'s going on back there -allenby (with an embarrassed look at the others) i wish we could corry, but like i said -we\\'ve only got fifteen minutes... corry (his voice rising and getting shaky as if losing control) well... well what\\'s a few lousy days to you? couple of card games. (he nods toward the others) how about you guys? you think i\\'ll murder you or something over a bad hand?  \\x0callenby (quietly and firmly) i\\'m sorry, corry. (he starts to take corry\\'s arm) let\\'s go to the shack -corry flings off his arm, not in anger, but in desperation. corry all right. two minutes are gone now. you\\'ve got thirteen minutes left. i wouldn\\'t want to foul up your schedule, allenby. not for a... (he looks away) not for a lousy game of cards. not for a few bottles of crummy beer. then he looks up slowly, turns to lock eyes with allenby. he seems to catch his breath for a moment. corry allenby... what about the pardon? adams (squinting up toward the sky, his voice very matter of fact) you\\'re out of luck, corry. sentence reads fifty years and they\\'re not even reviewing cases of homicide. you\\'ve been here four now. that makes forty-six to go, so get comfortable, dad huh? he laughs until his eyes reach allenby\\'s. allenby stares at him, then wets his lips and looks away. adams\\'s laugh dies out. track shot as the three men head toward the shack. corry\\'s eyes are down, staring at the sand where his feet make crunchy sounds as they sink down over the crust of the top layer. allenby, alongside of him as they walk, looks at him intermittently.  \\x0cdifferent angle as they reach a small knoll. over their shoulder we see the shack and car sitting here in mute, ugly loneliness. corry stops instinctively to stare at them. allenby touches his arm compassionately with an instinctive gentleness. allenby (quietly) i\\'m sorry, corry. unfortunately, we don\\'t make the rules. all we do is deliver your supplies and pass on information. i told you last time there\\'s been a lot of pressure back home about this kind of punishment. there are a whole lot of people who think it is unnecessarily cruel. well who knows what the next couple of years will bring? they may change their minds, alter the law, imprison you on earth like the old days. corry (turns to stare intently into the older man\\'s face) allenby, i have to tell you something. every morning... every morning when i get up i tell myself that this is my last day of sanity. i won\\'t be able to live another day of loneliness. not another day, and by noon when i can\\'t keep my fingers still and the inside of my mouth feels like gun powder and burnt copper and deep inside my gut i\\'ve got an ache that won\\'t go away and seems to be crawling all over the inside of my body, prickling at me, tearing little chunks out of me -- and then i think i\\'ve got to hold out for another day, just another day. (then he turns to stare down at the shack) but i can\\'t keep doing that day after day for the next forty-six years. i\\'ll lose my mind, allenby.  \\x0cadams you\\'re breakin\\' my heart -corry whirls around to stare at him. his features contort. there\\'s an animal-like growl that shouts out deep from his throat and suddenly, losing all control he lunges at adams, hitting him twice, crunching, desperate blows that smash against adams\\'s face and propel him backwards to sprawl face- first in the sand. allenby and the other officer grab corry\\'s arms. allenby (shouting) easy, corry, easy! gradually corry lets his body relax, going the route from a trembling, shaking ague to a heavy, tired motionlessness. med. close shot adams as he rises from the sand, gingerly touches the bruise on his face. adams i wouldn\\'t worry about going off my rocker, corry. it\\'s already happened. stir crazy, they used to call it. well, that\\'s what you are now. stir crazy. allenby (taking a step toward him to keep him back) back off, adams. you and carstairs go back and get the supplies. bring them over to the shack. adams (bridling) mr. corry has a broken leg or something? he points to corry. allenby go ahead, do as i tell you. and the big crate with the red tag -- handle that one (more)  \\x0callenby (cont\\'d) gently. carstairs how about the use of his buggy there? some of the stuff\\'s heavy. corry (as if shaken out of a dream softly) it isn\\'t running today. adams (laughs) it isn\\'t running today! what\\'s the matter, corry -- use it too much, do you? (to carstairs) you know, there\\'s so many places a guy can go out here. there\\'s the country club over the mound there and the seashore over that way, and the drive-in theater, that\\'s someplace around here, isn\\'t it, corry? allenby knock it off, adams, and go get the stuff. adams and carstairs turn with another look toward corry and start back across the desert. allenby takes corry\\'s arm and the two men walk toward the shack. long shot corry and allenby as they walk past the car and the shed and into the shack. int. shack full shot the room corry goes over to sit on the bed to stare numbly across the room at nothing. allenby crosses over to the icebox, takes out a jug of water, looks around the room and then over to corry. allenby glasses?  \\x0ccorry (motions) paper cups. on the shelf there. allenby unscrews the jar and sniffs, makes a face, then pours some water into a cup, takes it in a quick gulp. allenby we\\'ve got some fresh on board. they\\'ll be bringing it over. corry nods numbly. allenby pulls up a chair so that he\\'s sitting directly opposite corry. allenby brought you some magazines, too. strictly on my own. corry (nods) thanks. allenby and some old vintage movies. sciencefiction stuff. you\\'ll get a kick out of it. corry (nods, looks up unsmiling) i\\'m sure i will. allenby bites his lip and looks at corry for a long, silent moment, then he rises and crosses to the window. allenby i brought you something else, corry. it would mean my job if they suspected. (then he turns toward corry) it would be my neck if they found out for sure. corry look, allenby, i don\\'t want gifts now. i don\\'t want tidbits. it makes me feel like an animal in a cage and there\\'s a nice old lady out there who wants to throw peanuts at me. (more)  \\x0c(cont\\'d) (he suddenly lashes out and grabs allenby) a pardon, allenby, that\\'s the only gift i want. i\\'m not a murderer, i killed in selfdefense. a lot of people believe me and it happens to be the truth. i killed in selfdefense -allenby (gently takes corry\\'s hands off of him) i know, corry. i know all about it. (he retraces his steps back over the chair and sits down) i doubt if it\\'ll be much consolation to you, but it\\'s not easy handling this kind of assignment. stopping here four times a year and having to look at a man\\'s agony. corry you\\'re quite right. that\\'s precious little consolation. there\\'s a long, long silence. allenby rises. allenby well, i can\\'t bring you freedom, corry. all i can do... all i can do is to try to bring you things to help keep your sanity. (a pause) something... anything so you can fight loneliness. he looks across the room and out the window. long shot through the window adams and carstairs are both lugging a small metal cart loaded down with crates and supplies. they enter the area of the shack to bring the cart up close to the front door. the two of them take a heavy crate off the top of the pile, a red tag fluttering from one end. they lay it down in the sand.  \\x0ccarstairs (calls) you want this big crate opened up, captain? med. close shot allenby allenby (calls out) not yet. stay out there. i\\'ll be right out. two shot corry and allenby corry i\\'ll bite, captain. what\\'s the present? (he looks briefly through the window) what is it? he rises, goes over to the window to stare out at the long, rectangular box. med. long shot through the window of the box as it lies in the sand. med. close shot corry as he turns back toward the room. corry if it\\'s a twenty-year supply of puzzles, i\\'ll have to decline with thanks. i don\\'t need any puzzles, allenby. if i want to try to probe any mysteries -- i can look in the mirror and try to figure out my own. allenby (crosses over to the door, opens it, turns back to corry) we\\'ve got to go now. we\\'ll be back in three months. (a pause) are you listening to me, corry? this is important. corry stares at him.  \\x0callenby when you open up the crate there\\'s nothing you need do. the... item has been vacuumpacked. it needs no activator of any kind. the air will do that. there\\'ll be a booklet inside, too, that can answer any of your questions. corry you\\'re mysterious as hell. allenby i don\\'t mean to be. it\\'s just like i told you, though -- i\\'m risking a lot to have brought this here. (he points to the door) they don\\'t know what it is i brought. i\\'d appreciate your waiting until we get out of sight. corry (unemotionally) all right. have a good trip back... give my regards to... (he wets his lips) ...to broadway. and every place else while you\\'re at it. allenby sure, corry. i\\'ll see you. he goes out the door, motions to the other two men. they start to follow him. cut to: med. close shot corry standing at the door. corry allenby! cut to: reverse angle allenby and the other two corry\\'s p.o.v. the three men pause to look toward the shack. in the  \\x0cforeground in front of them we see the long crate lying all by itself in the sand. cut to: med. close shot corry he walks down the step and stands near the box, points to it. corry i don\\'t much care what it is. for the thought, allenby, for the... for the decency of it... i thank you. med. shot allenby allenby you\\'re quite welcome, corry. he turns and the other two follow him. long angle shot looking down at them as they slowly tramp across the sand and disappear over the line of dunes. med. close shot corry he watches them go, shading his eyes again at the sun, then very slowly he looks down at the box. he stares at it for a long moment, then he kneels down to feel its sides and finally finds the two release catches. his hands go out to touch them simultaneously. he pushes them, and very slowly the top of the box opens. tight close angle shot looking up as from inside the box toward corry\\'s face as he stares into it. his eyes suddenly widen with astonishment. cut abruptly to: med. close shot insert section of a space craft what we are seeing is just part of a hatch and a metal ladder. carstairs is just clambering up them to disappear inside this ship. adams starts to follow him. he pauses  \\x0chalfway up to look toward allenby, who in turn is staring off into the distance. adams captain -- just man to man, huh? allenby what? adams what did you bring him? what was in the box? med. close shot allenby as he slowly scratches the beard stubble of his square jaw. allenby (very softly as if to no one in particular) i\\'m not sure really. maybe just an illusion -- or maybe salvation. then he turns, motions adams up the ladder, and then follows him up. dissolve to: ext. the shack the top of the box has been opened and as the camera pans over it toward the shack we see that it is empty. the camera continues to pan over to the shack. dissolve through to: int. shack corry stands at the far end of the room staring off beyond the camera. he has a book in his hand which he suddenly seems to remember. he looks down at it, stares at the cover for a long moment, then opens it with both his hands. he studies it perplexed for a long moment; then he looks up again. then he looks down at the book again and slowly he reads aloud.  \\x0ccorry you are now the proud owner of a robot built in the form of a woman. to all intent and purpose this creature is a woman. physiologically and psychologically she is a human being with a set of emotions, a memory track, the ability to reason, to think, and to speak. she is beyond illness and under normal circumstances should have a life span similar to that of a comparable human being. her name is alicia. very slowly corry\\'s head rises. slow pan shot across the room to a shot of alicia who sits in a chair looking back at him. while she looks human, there is something too immobile, too emotionless about her features. there is a deadness to the eyes when they look back at him, showing neither resignation nor interest and only bare awareness. she\\'s dressed in a simple loose, flowing garment that neither adds to nor detracts from her femininity. corry takes a few hesitant steps toward her, his eyes wide, a fright working its way out. his mouth moves but nothing comes. close shot the girl alicia that\\'s my name -- alicia. what\\'s yours? close shot corry he stops dead in his tracks and suddenly he looks horrified, sick with distaste. he shakes his head from side to side and backs away. corry (in a very low voice) get out of here. (now a shout) get out of here! i don\\'t want any machine in here! go on, get out of here! with an effort he grabs the girl and propels her out the door and slams it behind her. then he leans against the door, eyes closed, breathing heavily and gradually his composure comes back. he takes a few steps back toward the center of the room. in the process he looks toward the  \\x0cwindow. long shot through the window the girl stands there in the yard staring at him. fade to black: end act one  \\x0cact two fade on: ext. desert corry\\'s shack in foreground int. shack corry is in the process of putting up a shelf. he stands on a small aluminum ladder, pounding with hammer and nails. the sweat pours down his face. he tests the shelf, then gets down off the ladder, picks up a towel and wipes his face, suddenly looks down at his feet. close shot bucket of water camera pulls back for shot of alicia standing there. corry well? alicia i brought you some water. where shall i put it? corry just leave it there and get out. alicia it will get warm just sitting there. corry (takes a glass, dips it in the water) you\\'d know, huh? he takes a drink. alicia i can feel thirst. corry wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and looks at her intensely. close shot corry as he stares at her. the same look of abhorrence as if clinically examining some foreign object.  \\x0cclose shot the girl her eyes go down and she turns away. two shot corry what else can you feel? alicia i don\\'t understand -corry i suppose you can feel heat and cold? how about pain? can you feel pain? alicia (nods softly) that too. corry takes a step over toward her, looking down at her. corry how? how can you? you\\'re a machine, aren\\'t you? alicia (whispering) yes. corry of course you are. so why didn\\'t they build you to look like a machine? why aren\\'t you made out of metal with nuts and bolts sticking out of you? with wires and electrodes and things like that? (his face contorts now and his voice rises) why do they turn you into a lie? why do they cover you with what looks like flesh? why do they give you a face? a face that if i look at long enough makes me think... makes me believe that... his hands grab her shoulders and go up past her neck to cup her face in a hard, painful grasp. alicia closes her eyes against the pain.  \\x0calicia corry -he releases her, strides past her and out the door. cut to: ext. the shack corry stands halfway to the car, his back to the shack. corry you mock me, you know that? when you look at me. when you talk to me -- i\\'m being mocked. alicia i\\'m sorry. (then she slowly reaches up, feels of her neck and shoulders) you hurt me, corry. corry (turns to her, walks over very close to her) hurt you? how could i hurt you? (he grabs her again) this isn\\'t flesh. there aren\\'t any nerves under there. there aren\\'t any tendons or muscles. he suddenly pushes her bodily away. cut to: flash shot as she sprawls head first into the sand. two shot then in the same fury that knows neither logic nor understanding, he searches wildly around and then picks up a shovel. he holds it by the handle and brandishes it up high. he shouts at her.  \\x0ccorry you know what you are? you\\'re like that broken-down heap i\\'ve got sitting in the yard. you\\'re a hunk of metal with arms and legs instead of wheels. but that heap doesn\\'t mock me like you do. it doesn\\'t look at me with make-believe eyes and talk to me with a make-believe voice. (he takes a step toward her, now the shovel up high) well listen you... listen machine, i\\'m sick at being mocked by a ghost. by a memory of women. and that\\'s all you are. you\\'re a reminder to me that i\\'m so lonely i\\'m about to lose my mind. and now his face is completely contorted, wild-eyed. he raises the shovel and is about to bring it down on her. angle shot looking down at her she looks up at him and then her eyes close and tears appear. then when she opens her eyes again we look at her as from a new and fresh perspective. the face is no longer inanimate, no longer immobile. it now has depth, emotion. it is filled with the nuances and mysteries of the woman and there is a beauty now that shines out. reverse angle looking up at corry as he reacts. he hesitates and then lets the shovel drop out of his hand onto the sand. very, very slowly he kneels down to crouch very close to her. his hand reaches out and touches the tears on her face and now his voice is gentle. corry you can cry too, can\\'t you? alicia (nods) with reason. and i can feel loneliness, too. corry takes her arm and helps her to her feet, then stands very close to her, looking down at her face.  \\x0ccorry we\\'ll go back inside now. we\\'ll eat our dinner. alicia all right. she starts to walk on ahead of him. corry alicia. she turns to look at him. corry i don\\'t care... i don\\'t care how you were born... or made. you\\'re flesh and blood to me. you\\'re a woman. (a pause) you\\'re my companion, alicia. i need you desperately. close shot alicia she smiles. alicia and i need you, corry. he goes up to walk alongside of her. long angle shot looking down on them as they walk toward the shack. lap dissolve to: ext. shack porch [day] med. close shot corry as he sits in the homemade rocker. he looks off toward the horizon and then slowly begins to write as we hear his voice.  \\x0ccorry\\'s voice alicia has been with me now for eleven months. twice when allenby has brought the ship in with supplies i\\'ve hidden her so that the others wouldn\\'t see her and i\\'ve seen the question in allenby\\'s eyes each time. it\\'s a question i have myself. it\\'s difficult to write down what has been the sum total of this very strange and bizarre relationship. it is man and woman, man and machine, and there are times even when i know that alicia is simply an extension of me. i hear my words coming from her. my emotions. the things that she has learned to love are those things that i\\'ve loved. he stops abruptly as he listens to alicia singing from inside the shack, he smiles and then continues to write again. corry\\'s voice but i think i\\'ve reached the point now where i shall not analyze alicia any longer. i shall accept her here simply as a part of my life -- an integral part. he continues to write silently now, turning the page to continue on the other side, and then he stops, puts the book and pencil down, rises, goes to the door and stands there looking at alicia, she turns to smile at him and he enters the room. the camera moves back so that it is shooting at them through the open door and across the ledger book which lies face up. we hear corry\\'s voice. corry\\'s voice because i\\'m not lonely any longer. each day can now be lived with... (a pause) i love alicia. nothing else matters. dissolve to: ext. desert [night] long shot looking up toward a mound of sand as hand in hand alicia and corry race down toward the  \\x0ccamera. he stops her abruptly and points to the sky. corry alicia, look. that\\'s the star, betelgeuse. it\\'s in the constellation of orion. and there\\'s the \"\"great bear\"\" with its pointer stars in line with the northern star. and there\\'s the constellation hercules. you see, alicia? he traces a path across the sky with his upraised hand and her eyes follow it. then he turns to look down at her face upturned in the half-light. alicia (softly) god\\'s beauty. corry (nods) that\\'s right, alicia. god\\'s beauty. suddenly the girl\\'s eyes stop as they traverse the sky. she points. alicia that star, corry? what\\'s that star? close shot corry as he stares at something in the sky. corry that\\'s not a star. that\\'s a ship, alicia. alicia a ship? very slowly there\\'s a ray of light that plays on both their faces and gets brighter and larger. alicia moves closer to him. alicia there\\'s no ship due here now, corry. you said not for another three months. you said after the last time it wouldn\\'t be for (more)  \\x0calicia (cont\\'d) another -corry (thoughtfully) it must be allenby\\'s ship. it\\'s the only one that ever comes close. they stop at other asteroids, then come here. (he looks away again, pensively) that means they\\'ll probably be here in the morning. (another pause) i wonder why. alicia (takes a few steps toward him, concerned) corry -- what\\'s it mean? corry (turns to her and smiles) in the morning... we\\'ll find out. come on, let\\'s go back to the house. dissolve to: ext. desert [day] long shot top of dunes three space-suited figures appear. allenby\\'s in the foreground. he suddenly stops and looks toward the camera as corry steps in front of it and into the frame. allenby hello, corry. we wondered where you were. corry you have trouble? allenby no, we had no trouble. he motions the others to follow him and they walk down the dune to stand close to corry.  \\x0callenby this is a scheduled stop. adams we\\'ve got good news for you, corry. corry (looks from face to face) i\\'m not interested. the others exchange looks of surprise. allenby you better hear what it is. corry you heard me, allenby. i\\'m not interested. allenby you will be. this i guarantee! corry takes a few backward steps looking paranoically from one to the other. corry allenby, give me a break, will you? i don\\'t want trouble. allenby we don\\'t either. adams (to one of the others) he gets worse! if we\\'d come a month later he\\'d have been eating sand or something. corry now turns and starts to walk away from them, occasionally looking over his shoulder. allenby (calls out to him) corry! track shot corry as he walks faster and faster and is about to break into a dead run. cut to:  \\x0clong shot over corry\\'s shoulder looking at allenby who now shouts. allenby corry! he runs, crunching on the hard sand, to come up close to corry, he grabs him, whirls him around. allenby it\\'s this way, corry, all the sentences have been reviewed. they\\'ve given you a pardon, we\\'re to take you back home on the ship, but we\\'ve got to take off from here in exactly twenty minutes, we can\\'t wait any longer. we\\'ve been dodging meteor storms all the way out. we\\'re almost out of fuel. any longer than twenty minutes we\\'ll have passed the point of departure and then i don\\'t think we\\'d ever make it. corry stares at him and then at the other men who have come down the dune behind him. tight close shot corry his eyes dart about, going wide as the sense of what\\'s been said to him seeps in. he tries to speak, but for a moment nothing comes out. corry wait a minute, allenby. wait just a minute. (he closes his eyes tightly, then opens them) what did you just say? what did you just say about a -allenby (filling it in) a pardon. adams (coming up alongside) but it won\\'t do any of us any good unless you get your stuff together and get ready (more)  \\x0cadams (cont\\'d) to move, corry. we\\'ve picked up seven other men off asteroids and we\\'ve only got room for about fifteen pounds of stuff, so you\\'d better pick up what you need in a hurry and leave the rest of it behind. (then with a grin, looking off in the direction of the shack) such as it is. corry (struggling to keep his voice firm but already it begins to shake with joy and excitement) stuff? my stuff? i don\\'t even have fifteen pounds of stuff! he laughs uproaringly, turns, and again starts to walk toward the shack. track shot all of them as they walk corry\\'s voice goes up and down in uncontrollable laughter, a combination of nerves, relief and almost unbeatable excitement. the words spew out as he walks. corry i\\'ve got a shirt, a pencil and a ledger book. a pair of shoes. (then he throws back his head and laughs again) the car you can keep here. that\\'ll be for the next poor devil. allenby (evenly) there won\\'t be any next poor devil. there won\\'t be any more exiles, corry. this was the last time. corry good! wonderful! thank god for that! they continue to walk again.  \\x0ccorry we\\'ll let it rest here then. the farthest auto graveyard in the universe! and alicia and i will wave to it as we leave. we\\'ll just look out of a porthole and throw it a kiss goodbye. the car, the shack, the salt lakes, the range. the whole works! alicia and i will just -he stops abruptly, suddenly conscious of the silence and the looks. pan shot across the faces of the other men as they stare at him. adams (his eyes narrow) who? who, corry? tight close shot allenby his eyes close for a moment. allenby (sotto) oh my dear god, i forgot her! group shot corry\\'s eyes move around from face to face. corry allenby -(and then accusative) allenby, it\\'s alicia -carstairs (whispers under his breath to adams) he\\'s out of his mind, isn\\'t he? adams who\\'s alicia, corry?  \\x0ccorry (laughs uproariously) who\\'s alicia? adams, you idiot! who\\'s alicia! you brought her! you brought her here in a box! she\\'s a woman -(and then he stops, looks away for a moment, softly, then looks toward allenby) a robot. (and then once again looks at allenby) but closer to a woman. she\\'s kept me alive, allenby. i swear to you -- if it weren\\'t for her -he looks around again at the circle of silent faces that stare at him. close shot corry corry what\\'s the matter? you worried about alicia? (he shakes his head) you needn\\'t be. alicia\\'s harmless. i tell you she\\'s like a woman. and she\\'s gentle and kind and without her, allenby, i tell you without her i\\'d have been finished. i\\'d have given up. (a long pause and then very quietly) you would have only had to come back to bury me! group shot adams (to allenby) that\\'s what you wouldn\\'t let us look at, huh? the crate with the red tag -corry (to allenby) sorry, captain, but i had to let it out --  \\x0callenby that\\'s all right, corry. that\\'s all over with, but unfortunately that\\'s not the problem -corry (again with a high uncontrollable laugh) problem? there aren\\'t any problems! there are no more problems left on heaven or earth! we\\'ll pack up fifteen pounds of stuff and we\\'ll climb in that ship of yours and when we get back to that beautiful green earth -tight close shot corry corry (he whispers it) fifteen pounds. (and then he shouts it) fifteen pounds? (he looks from face to face again) you\\'ve got to have room for more than that. throw out stuff. throw out equipment. alicia weighs more than fifteen pounds. group shot allenby (quietly) that\\'s the point, corry. we\\'re stripped now. we\\'ve got room for you and nothing else except that ledger of yours and the pencil. (he shakes his head) you\\'ll have to leave the robot here. corry (shouting) she\\'s not just a robot, allenby. you don\\'t understand. you leave her behind -- that\\'s murder.  \\x0callenby (shakes his head) i\\'m sorry, corry -- i don\\'t have any choice -corry (backing away, his voice desperate) no, allenby. you don\\'t understand. you can\\'t leave her behind. (and then he screams) alicia, come here! (then he turns to them) you\\'ll see. you\\'ll see why you can\\'t leave her behind. (then he shouts again) alicia! long angle shot looking down as corry races toward the shack followed by the others. cut abruptly to: int. shack as corry smashes open the door and races inside only to find the room empty. he stands in the middle of the room looking around and then over toward the door as allenby enters followed by the other men. allenby where is she, corry? corry i don\\'t know. but when you see her you\\'ll know why you can\\'t leave her behind. adams look, corry. we just want you to get your gear packed and get out of here. (he looks at his watch, nervously to allenby) we\\'ve only got about ten minutes. how about it, captain?  \\x0callenby (gently) come on, corry. corry (backs further into the room) no! i\\'m not leaving, allenby. i told you that. i can\\'t leave. allenby you don\\'t understand. this is our last trip here. this is anybody\\'s last trip. this is off the route now. that means no supplies, no nothing. that means it you stay here you die here. and that way, there\\'d be a day, corry, when you\\'d pray for that death to come quicker than it\\'s bargained for -corry (illogically, half- wildly) i can\\'t help it allenby. i can\\'t leave her behind. and you won\\'t take her. so that means i stay. (and then looking over his shoulder wildly, he screams) alicia! come here, alicia! let them see you. don\\'t be afraid -close shot allenby allenby corry, listen to me. i saw this... this thing get crated, shoved into a box. corry (shakes his head) i don\\'t care. allenby she\\'s a machine, corry. she\\'s a motor with wires and tubes and batteries.  \\x0ccorry (screaming) she\\'s a woman! allenby wets his lips, bites his lip for a moment standing there unsure, not knowing what to do. through the window, outside in the yard, we see another member of the crew walk through the yard, pause near the shack. crewman captain? captain allenby? allenby what? crewman captain, we\\'ve got just four minutes left. we\\'ve got to take off! if we wait longer than that, sir, we\\'ll have moved to a point too far out. i don\\'t think we\\'ll make it, sir. adams (his voice frightened) how about it, captain allenby, leave him here! allenby we can\\'t leave him here. sick mad, or halfalive, we\\'ve got to bring him back. those are the orders. he takes another step toward corry who backs against the wall. allenby corry, now it isn\\'t just you. now it\\'s all of us. so that means we can\\'t talk any more and we can\\'t argue with you. we simply just have to take you! he makes a quick motion with one hand. adams and carstairs take a step into the room to flank allenby and to converge on corry. corry, with a kind of animal shout bulls his way past them pushing adams out of the way and bolts out of the door.  \\x0ccut to: long angle shot looking down on the desert at the figure of corry as he races, stumbling, falling, picking himself up again. his voice can be heard shouting over and over again. corry (shouting) alicia! alicia! different angles of him running the others in pursuit. long angle shot looking up toward a dune as he suddenly appears at the top and stares down. camera sweeps to the left and down for a shot of alicia standing alone down in the depression of the sand. full shot the place corry alicia! behind him allenby and the others appear, corry starts toward the girl, carstairs tackles him and then adams pounces on him, they hold him tight as he shouts. corry alicia, talk to them. tell them you\\'re a woman -allenby takes a few steps down the dune and stops halfway down. he looks back at corry. allenby i\\'m sorry, corry, i don\\'t have any choice.

[the camera slowly pans across the porches again. we see a man screwing a light bulb on a front porch, then getting down oﬂ the stool to ﬂick the switch and ﬁnding that nothing happens.  another man is working on an electric power mower. he plugs in the plug, ﬂicks on the switch of the power mower, oﬂ and on, with nothing happening. through the window of a front porch, we see a woman pushing her ﬁnger back and forth on the dial hook. her  voice is indistinct and distant, but intelligible and repetitive] woman operator, operator, something\\'s wrong on the phone, operator! [mrs. brand comes out on the porch and calls to steve]  mrs. brand [calling.] steve, the power\\'s off. i had the soup on the stove and the stove just stopped working.  woman same thing over here. i can\\'t get anybody on the phone either. the phone seems to be dead.  [ we look down the street as we hear the voices creep up from down below, small, mildly  disturbed voices, highlighting these kinds of phrases: ]  voices electricity\\'s off. phone won\\'t work. can\\'t get a thing on the radio. my power motor won\\'t move, won\\'t work at all.  radio\\'s gone dead. [pete van horn, a tall, thin man is seen standing in front of his house.]  van horn i\\'ll cut through the backyard...see if the power\\'s still on floral street. i\\'ll be right back.  [he walks past the side of his house and disappears into the backyard. the hammer on van horn\\'s hip as he walks. the camera pans down slowly until we \\'re looking at ten or eleven people standing around the street and overﬂowing to the curb and sidewalk. in the  background is steve brand \\'5 car.]  steve doesn\\'t make sense. why should the power go off all of a sudden, and the phone line? don maybe some sort of an electrical storm or something.  charlie that don\\'t seem likely. sky\\'s just as blue as anything. not a cloud. no lightning.  no thunder. no nothing. how could it be a storm? woman i can\\'t get a thing on the radio. not even the portable. [ the people again murmur softly in wonderment and question]  charlie well why don\\'t you go downtown and check with the police, though they\\'ll probably think we\\'re crazy or something. a little power failure and right away  we get all ﬂustered and everything.  steve it isn\\'t just the power failure, charlie. if it was, we\\'d still be able to get a  broadcast on the portable. [there\\'s a murmur of reaction to this. steve looks from face to face and then over to his car.]  steve i\\'ll run downtown. we\\'ll get this all straightened out.  [he walks over to the car, gets in it, turns the key. beyond it we see the crowd watching him  from the other side. steve starts the engine. it turns over sluggishly and thenjust stops dead.  he tries it again and this time he can \\'1‘ get it to turn over. then, very slowly and reﬂectively,  he turns the key back to \"\"oﬁ\"\" and then slowly gets out of the car. as they stare at steve. he  stands for a moment by the car, then walks toward the group.]  steve don steve woman  charlie  steve  i don\\'t understand it. it was working fine before...  out of gas?  [shakes his heacﬂ i just had it filled up.  what\\'s it mean?  it\\'s just as if...as if everything had stopped... [then he turns toward steve] we\\'d better walk downtown. [another murmur of assent at this.]  the two of us can go, charlie. [he turns to look back at the car.] it couldn\\'t be  the meteor. a meteor couldn\\'t do this.  [he and charlie exchange a look, then they start to walk away from the group. we see  tommy, a serious-facedfourteen-year—old in spectacles who stands a few feet away from  the group, halfway between them and the two men who start to walk down the sidewalk]  tommy steve  tommy  steve tommy steve charlie  tommy  mr. brand...you better not! why not?  they don\\'t want you to. [steve and charlie exchange a grin and steve looks back toward the boy.]  who doesn\\'t want us to?  [jerks his head in the general direction of the distant horizon] them! them?  who are them?  [very intently] whoever was in that thing that came by overhead.  [steve knits his brows for a moment, cocking his head questioningly. his voice is intense]  steve  what?  tommy whoever was in the thing that came over. i don\\'t think they want us to leave  here.  [steve leaves charlie and walks over to the boy. he kneels down in front of him. he forces  his voice to remain gentle. he reaches out and holds the boy.]  steve what do you mean? what are you talking about?  tommy they don\\'t want us to leave. that\\'s why they shut everything off. steve what makes you say that? whatever gave you that idea?  woman [from the crowd.] now isn\\'t that the craziest thing you ever heard?  tommy [persistently but a little intimidated by the crowd.] it\\'s always that way, in  every story i ever read about a ship landing from outer space.  woman [ to the boy\\'s mother, sally, who stands on the fringe of the crowd.] from outer space, yet! sally, you better get that boy of yours up to bed. he\\'s been  reading too many comic books or seeing too many movies or something. sally tommy, come over here and stop that kind of talk.  steve go ahead, tommy. we\\'ll be right back. and you\\'ll see. that wasn\\'t any ship or  anything like it. that was just a...a meteor or something. likely as no ——  [he turns to the group, now trying to weight his words with an optimism he obviously  doesn\\'tfeel but is desperately trying to instill in himself as well as the others.]  steve no doubt it did have something to do with all this power failure and the rest of  it. meteors can do some crazy things. like sunspots.  don [picking up the cue.] sure. that\\'s the kind of thing — like sunspots. they raise cain with radio reception all over the world. and this thing being so close — why there\\'s no telling the sort of stuff it can do. [he wets his lips, smiles nervously] go ahead, charlie. you and steve go into town and see if that isn\\'t what\\'s  causing it all.  [steve and charlie again walk away from the group down the sidewalk. the people watch  silently. tommy stares at them, biting his lips and ﬁnally calling out again.] tommy mr. brand!  [ the two men stop again. tommy takes a step toward them.]  tommy mr. brand...please don\\'t leave here.  [steve and charlie can be seen beyond them. they stop once again and turn toward the boy. there\\'s a murmur in the crowd, a murmur of irritation and concern as if the boy were bringing up fears that shouldn\\'t be brought up; words which carried with them a strange kind of validity that came without logic but nonetheless registered and had meaning and eﬁ‘ect. again the murmur of reaction from the crowd. tommy is partlyfrightened and  partly deﬁant as well.]  tommy you might not even be able to get to town. it was that way in the story. nobody  could leave. nobody except—— steve except who?  tommy except the people they\\'d sent down ahead of them. they looked just like humans. and it wasn\\'t until the ship landed that— [ the boy suddenly stops again, conscious of the parents staring at them and of the sudden hush of the  crowd.]  sally [in a whisper, sensing the antagonism of the crowd.] tommy, please  son...honey, don\\'t talk that way——  man one that kid shouldn\\'t talk that way...and we shouldn\\'t stand here listening to him. why this is the craziest thing i ever heard of. the kid tells us a comic book plot  and here we stand listenin—— [steve walks toward the camera, stops by the boy.]  steve go ahead, tommy. what kind of story was this? what about the people that  they sent out ahead?  tommy that was the way they prepared things for the landing. they sent four people. a mother and a father and two kids who looked just like humans...but they  weren\\'t.  [there\\'s another silence as steve looks toward the crowd and then toward tommy. he  wears a tight grin.]  steve well, i guess what we\\'d better do then is to run a check on the neighborhood  and see which ones of us are really human.  [there\\'s laughter at this, but it\\'s a laughter that comes from a desperate attempt to lighten the atmosphere. i t\\'s a release kind of laugh. the people look at one another in the middle of  their laughter.]  charlie there must be somethin\\' better to do than stand around makin\\' bum jokes about it. [rubs his jaw nervously] i wonder if floral street\\'s got the same deal we got. [he looks past the houses.] where is pete van horn anyway? didn\\'t he  get back yet? suddenly there\\'s the sound of a car\\'s engine starting to turn over.  [suddenly there is a sound of a car’s engine starting to turn over. we look across the street  toward the driveway of les goodman’s house. he’s at the wheel trying to start the car.] sally can you get it started, les? goodman no dice.  [he walks toward the group. he stops suddenly as behind him, inexplicably and with a noise that inserts itselfinto the silence, the car engine starts up all by itself. goodman whirls around to stare toward it. the car idles roughly, smoke coming from the exhaust, the frame shaking gently. goodman’s eyes go wide, and he runs over to his car. the people stare at the car.]  man one he got the car started somehow. he got his car started! [the people stare,  somehow caught up by this revelation and somehow, illogically, wildly,frightened. woman how come his car just up and started like that? sally all by itself. he wasn\\'t anywheres near it. it started all by itself.  [don approaches the group, stops a few feet away to look toward goodman\\'s car and then  back toward the group.]  don and he never did come out to look at that thing that ﬂew overhead. he wasn\\'t even interested. [he turns to the faces in the group, his face taut and serious.] why? why didn\\'t he come out with the rest of us to look?  charlie he always was an oddball. him and his whole family. real oddball. don what do you say we ask him?  [ the group suddenly starts towards the house. in this brieffraction of a moment they take the ﬁrst step toward performing a metamorphosis that changes people from a group into a  mob. they begin to head purposefully across the street toward the house at the end. steve  stands in front of them. for a moment their fear almost turns their walk into a wild  stampede, but steve\\'s voice, loud, incisive, and commanding, makes them stop.] steve wait a minute...wait a minute! let\\'s not be a mob!  [the people stop as a group, seem to pause for a moment, and then much more quietly and slowly start to walk across the street. goodman stands there alonefacing the people]  goodman i just don\\'t understand it. i tried to start it and it wouldn\\'t start. you saw me. all  of you saw me.  [and now, just as suddenly as the engine started, it stops and there\\'s a long silence that is  gradually intruded upon by the frightened murmuring of the people. ] goodman i don\\'t understand. i swear...i don\\'t understand. what\\'s happening?  don maybe you better tell us. nothing\\'s working on this street. nothing. no lights,  no power, no radio. [and then meaningfully] nothing except one car — yours!  [ the people pick this up and now their murmuring becomes a loud chant ﬁlling the air with accusations and demands for action. two of the men pass don and head toward goodman  who backs away, backing into his car and now at bay.]  goodman wait a minute now. you keep your distance — all of you. so i\\'ve got a car that starts by itself — well that\\'s a freak thing, i admit it. but does that make me some  kind of criminal or something? i don\\'t know why the car works — it just does!  [ this stops the crowd momentarily, and now goodman, still backing away, goes toward his front porch. he goes up the steps and then stops to standfacing the mob.  we see steve as he comes through the crowd.]  steve [quietly] we\\'re all on a monster kick, les. seems that the general impression holds that maybe one family isn\\'t what we think they are. monsters from outer space or something. different that us. fifth columnists from the vast beyond. [h e chuckles] you know anybody that might fit that description around here on maple street?  goodman what is this, a gag or something? this a practical joke or something?  [ we see a close up of a porch light that suddenly goes out. there\\'s a murmur from the  group.]  goodman  woman  goodman steve charlie  woman  now, i suppose that\\'s supposed to incriminate me! the light goes on and off. that really does it, doesn\\'t it? [he looks around the faces of the people] ijust don\\'t understand this—— [he wets his lips, looking from face to face. ] look, you all know me. we\\'ve lived here five years. right in this house. we\\'re no different than any of the rest of you! we\\'re no different at all. really...this whole thing is  just...j ust weird——  well, if that\\'s the case, les goodman, explain why—[she stops suddenly,  clamping her mouth shut]  [softly] explain what?  [interjecting.] look, let\\'s forget this——  [overlapping him.] go ahead, let her talk. what about it? explain what?  [a little reluctantly] well...sometimes i go to bed late at night. a couple of times...a couple of times i\\'d come out on the porch and i\\'d see mr. goodman here in the wee hours of the morning standing out in front of his house...looking up at the sky. [she looks around the circle of faces. ] that\\'s right. looking up at the sky as if...as if he were waiting for something. [a pause.] as if he were  looking for something.  [there\\'s a murmur of reaction from the crowd again. as goodman starts toward them, they back awayfrightened.]  goodman  you know really...this is for laughs. you know what i\\'m guilty of? [h e laughs.] i’m guilty of insomnia. now what\\'s the penalty for insomnia? [at this point the laugh, the humor, leaves his voice.] did you hear what i said? i said it was insomnia. [a pause as he looks around, then shouts.] i said it was insomnia! you fools. you scared, frightened rabbits, you. you\\'re sick people, do you know that? you\\'re sick people — all of you! and you don\\'t even know what you\\'re starting because let me tell you...let me tell you — this thing you\\'re starting — that should frighten you. as god is my witness...you\\'re letting something begin here  that\\'s a nightmare!  act 11  [ we see a medium shot of the goodman entry hall at night. on the side table rests an unlit candle. mrs. goodman walks into scene, a glass of milk in hand. she sets the milk down on the table, lights the candle with a match from a box on the table, picks up the glass of milk,  and starts out of scene.  mrs. goodman comes through her porch door, glass of milk in hand. the entry hall, with  table and lit candle, can be seen behind her.  outside the camera takes a slow pan down the sidewalk, taking in little knots of people who stand around talking in low voices. at the end of each conversation they look toward les goodman\\'s house. from the various houses we can see candlelight but no electricity, and there\\'s an all-pervading quiet that blankets the whole area, disturbed only by the almost whispered voices of the people as they stand around. the camera pans over to one  group where charlie stands. he stares across at goodman\\'s house. two men stand across the street in almost sentry-like poses.]  sally [a little timorously.] it just doesn\\'t seem right, though, keeping watch on them. why...he was right when he said he was one of our neighbors. why, i\\'ve known  ethel goodman ever since they moved in. we\\'ve been good friends——  charlie that don\\'t prove a thing. any guy who\\'d spend his time lookin\\' up at the sky early in the morning — well there\\'s something wrong with that kind of a person. there\\'s something that ain\\'t legitimate. maybe under normal circumstances we could let it go by, but these aren\\'t normal circumstances. why, look at this street! nothin\\' but candles. why, it\\'s like goin\\' back into the dark ages or  somethin\\'!  [from several yards down as steve walks down the steps of his porch, walks down the street  over to les goodman\\'s house, and then stops at the foot of the steps. goodman stands there, his wife behind him, veryfrightened.]  goodman j ust stay right where you are, steve. we don\\'t want any trouble, but this time if  anybody sets foot on my porch, that\\'s what they\\'re going to get — trouble!  steve look, les——  goodman i\\'ve already explained to you people. i don\\'t sleep very well at night sometimes. i  get up and i take a walk and i look up at the sky. i look at the stars!  mrs. goodman  steve  that\\'s exactly what he does. why this whole thing, it\\'s...it\\'s some kind of  madness or something.  [nods grimly] that\\'s exactly what it is — some kind of madness.  charlie\\'s voice  steve  woman  charlie  steve  charlie  don  charlie  [ shrill, from across the street] you best watch who you\\'re seen with steve!  until we get this all straightened out, you ain\\'t exactly above suspicion yourself. [whirling around toward him.] or you, charlie. or any of us, it seems. from age eight on up!  what i\\'d like to know is, what are we gonna do? j ust stand around here all night?  there\\'s nothin\\' else we can do! [he turns back looking toward steve and  goodman again.] one of \\'em\\'ll tip their hand. they got to.  [raising his voice.] there\\'s something you can do, charlie. you could go home and keep your mouth shut. you could quit strutting around like a self—appointed  hanging judge and just climb into bed and forget it.  you sound real anxious to have that happen, steve. i think we better keep our  eye on you too!  [as if he were taking the bit in his teeth, takes a hesitant step to the front. ] i think everything might as well come out now. [he turns toward steve] your  wife\\'s done plenty of talking, steve, about how odd you are!  [picking this up, his eyes widening.] go ahead, tell us what she\\'s said.  [steve walks toward them from across the street]  steve  go ahead, what\\'s my wife said? let\\'s get it all out. let\\'s pick out every idiosyncrasy of every single man, woman, and child on the street. and then we might as well set up some kind of a kangaroo court. how about a firing squad at dawn, charlie, so we can get rid of all the suspects? narrow them down. make it  easier for you.  don  there\\'s no need gettin\\' so upset, steve. it\\'s just that...well...myra\\'s talked about how there\\'s been plenty of nights you spend hours down in your basement workin\\' on some kind of radio of something. well, none of us have ever seen that radio——  [by this time steve has reached the group. he stands there deﬁantly close to them.]  charlie  steve  go ahead, steve. what kind of \"\"radio set\"\" you workin\\' on? i never seen it. neither has anyone else. who you talk to on that radio set? and who talks to you?  i\\'m surprised at you, charlie. how come you\\'re so dense all of a sudden? [a pause.] who do i talk to? i talk to monsters from outer space. i talk to three—  headed green men who ﬂy over here in what look like meteors.  [steve’s wife steps down from the porch, bites her lip, calls out]  mrs. brand  steve  charlie  steve  steve! steve, please. [then looking around frightened, she walks toward the group. it\\'s just a ham radio set, that\\'s all. i bought him a book on it myself. it\\'s just a ham radio set. a lot of people have them. i can show it to you. it\\'s right  down in the basement.  [whirls around toward her.] show them nothing! if they want to look inside  our house — let them get a search warrant. look, buddy, you can\\'t afford to——  [interrupting.] charlie, don\\'t tell me what i can afford! and stop telling me who\\'s dangerous and who isn\\'t and who\\'s safe and who\\'s a menace. [he turns to the group and shouts.] and you\\'re with him too — all of you! you\\'re standing here all set to crucify — all set to ﬁnd a scapegoat — all desperate to point some kind of a finger at a neighbor! well now look, friends, the only thing that\\'s  gonna happen is that we\\'ll eat each other up alive——  [he stops abruptly as charlie suddenly grabs his arm.]  charlie  [in a hushed voice.] that\\'s not the only thing that can happen to us.  [cut to a long shot looking down the street. a figure has suddenly materialized in the gloom  and in the silence we can hear the clickety—clack of slow, measured footsteps on concrete as  the ﬁgure walks slowly toward them. one of the women lets out a stiﬂed cry. the young  mother grabs her boy as do a couple of others.] tommy [shouting,frightened.] it\\'s the monster! it\\'s the monster!  [another woman lets out a wail and the peoplefall back in a group, staring toward the darkness and the approaching ﬁgure. people stand in the shadows watching. don martin  joins them, carrying a shotgun. he holds it up.] don we may need this.  steve a shotgun? [he pulls it out of don\\'s hand.] good lord — will anybody think a thought around here? will you people wise up? what good would a shotgun do  against—— [now charlie pulls the gun from steve\\'s hand.]  charlie no more talk, steve. you\\'re going to talk us into a grave! you\\'d let whatever\\'s  out there walk right over us, wouldn\\'t yuh? well some of us won\\'t!  [he swings the gun around to point it toward the sidewalk.  the dark ﬁgure continues to walk toward them.  the group there,fearful, apprehensive, mothers clutching children, men standing in front of wives. charlie slowly raises the gun. as the ﬁgure gets closer and closer he suddenly pulls the trigger. the sound of it explodes in the stillness. there is a long shot looking down at the figure, who suddenly lets out a small cry, stumblesforward onto his knees and thenfalls forward on his face. don, charlie, and steve raceforward over to him. steve is thereﬁrst  and turns the man over. now the crowd gathers around them.] steve [slowly looks up.] it\\'s pete van horn.  don [in a hushed voice.] pete van horn! he was just gonna go over to the next  block to see if the power was on—— woman you killed him, charlie. you shot him dead!  charlie [looks around at the circle of faces, his eyesfrightened, his face contorted.] but...but i didn\\'t know who he was. i certainly didn\\'t know who he was. he comes walkin\\' out of the darkness — how am i supposed to know who he was? [he grabs steve] steve — you know why i shot! how was i supposed to know he  wasn\\'t a monster or something? [he grabs don now.] we\\'re all scared of the  same thing. i was just tryin\\' to...tryin\\' to protect my home, that\\'s all! look, all of you, that\\'s all i was tryin\\' to do. [he looks down wildly at the body.] i didn\\'t  know it was somebody we knew! i didn\\'t know—  [there\\'s a sudden hush and then an intake of breath. we see a medium shot of the living room window of charlie\\'s house. the window is not lit, but suddenly the house lights come on behind it.]  woman [in a very hushed voice.] charlie...charlie...the lights just went on in your house. why did the lights just go on?  don what about it, charlie? how come you\\'re the only one with lights now? goodman that\\'s what i\\'d like to know. [a pause as they all stare toward charlie.]  goodman you were so quick to kill, charlie, and you were so quick to tell us who we had to be careful of. well, maybe you had to kill. maybe peter there was trying to tell us something. maybe he\\'d found out something and came back to tell us who there  was amongst us we should watch out for—— [charlie backs away from the group, his eyes wide with fright. ]  charlie no...no...it\\'s nothing of the sort! i don\\'t know why the lights are on. i swear i  don\\'t. somebody’s pulling a gag or something. [he bumps against steve who grabs him and whirls him aground.]  steve a gag? a gag? charlie, there\\'s a dead man on the sidewalk and you killed him! does this thing look like a gag to you?  [charlie breaks away and screams as he runs toward his house.] charlie no! no! please!  [a man breaks away from the crowd to chase charlie.  as the man tackles him and lands on top of him. the other people start to run toward them. charlie is up on his feet, breaks away from the other man\\'s grasp, lands a couple of desperate punches that push the man aside. then he forces his way, ﬁghting, through the  crowd to once again breakfree,jumps up on his front porch.  on the front porch as a rock thrown from the group smashes a window alongside of him,  the broken glass ﬂying past him. a couple of pieces cutting him. he stands there perspiring,  rumpled, blood running down from a cut on the cheek. h is wife breaks away from the group to throw herselfinto his arms. he buries his face against her. we can see the crowd  converging on the porch now.]  voices it must have been him. he\\'s the one.  we got to get charlie.  [another rock lands on the porch. now charlie pushes his wife behind him,facing the  group.]  charlie look, look i swear to you...it isn\\'t me...but i do know who it is...l swear to you, i do know who it is. i know who the monster is here. i know who it is that doesn\\'t  belong. i swear to you i know. charlie [shouting] what are you waiting for? woman [shouting] come on, charlie, come on. man one [shouting] who is it, charlie, tell us! don [pushing his way to the front of the crowd.] all right, charlie, let\\'s hear it! [charlie’s eyes dart around wildly.] charlie lt\\'s...it\\'s... man two [screaming] go ahead, charlie, tell us. charlie it\\'s...it\\'s the kid. it\\'s tommy. he\\'s the one.  [there\\'s a gasp from the crowd as we cut to a shot of sally, holding her son tommy. the boy at ﬁrst doesn\\'t understand and then realizing the eyes are all on him, buries his face  against his mother.] sally [backs away.] that\\'s crazy. that\\'s crazy. he\\'s a little boy.  woman but he knew! he was the only one who knew! he told us all about it. well, how  did he know? how could he have known?  [ the various people take this up and repeat the questions aloud, registeringfear, hate,  bewilderment]  voices how could he know? who told him? make the kid answer.  man one what about goodman\\'s car? don it was charlie who killed old man van horn.  woman but it was the kid here who knew what was going to happen all the time. he was  the one who knew! [steve shouts at his hysterical neighbors.] steve are you all gone crazy? [pause as he looks about] stop. [a ﬁst crashes at steve\\'sface, staggering him back out of shot.  there are several close up camera shots suggesting the coming of violence. a hand ﬁres a riﬂe. a ﬁst clenches. a hand grabs the hammer from van horn\\'s body, etc. meanwhile, we  hear the following lines.] don charlie has to be the one — where\\'s my riﬂe—— woman les goodman\\'s the one. his car started! let\\'s wreck it. mrs. goodman  what about steve\\'s radio — he\\'s the one that called them—— mr. goodman  smash the radio. get me a hammer. get me something. steve stop — stop—— charlie where\\'s that kid — let\\'s get him. man one get steve — get charlie — they\\'re working together.

(he drums his fingers  on the desk) ultimatum, mr. bemis. you will henceforth devote your time to your job and forget reading — or you\\'ll find yourself outdoors on a park bench reading from morning to night - for want of having a job: do i make myself perfectly clear?  bemis (nods humbly) yes, sir, you do. it\\'s just that-  carsville (impatiently) just that what, bemis? make it quick and then get back to your cage.  bemi s (forlornly, softly) it\\'s just that...my wife doesn‘t allow me to read at home. when i come home at night and pick up the paper, she yanks it out of my hand. after dinner when i try to look at a (more)  bemis (cont\\'d) magazine, she hides them. it\\'s gotten so that...i find myself trying to read the labels on condiment bottles on the dinner table. now she won\\'t even let me use catsup.  carsville unasked i give you my reaction to this. your wife is an amazingly bright woman. i remember last november you spent the better part of the days reading campaign buttons on customer\\'s lapels. you\\'ll recall, mr. bemis, the young woman who took considerable offense at this and tried to hit you with the umbrella.  bemis (unhappily) i remember that very well, mr. carsville. she never gave me a chance to tell her that i was only looking at who she was voting for.  carsville (rises and turns his back, folds his hands behind him) good day, mr. bemis.  bemis (sighs) good day, mr. carsville.  10. track shot as he turns and starts toward the door. he pauses momentarily by a table near the door that has some magazines on it. he tilts his head so that he can read the cover of one of the magazines.  11. different angle mr. carsville who looks over his shoulder, clears his throat warningly. bemis hurriedly takes his eyes off the magazines, smiles a little sick, and then hurries  out of the office.  dissolve to: 12. int. bemis living room [bax]  slow pan shot across the room, which is small, tidy, and antiseptically unattractive, as if furnished by a woman yoga whose basic tenant of living is self—denial. the camera winds up its pan on a shot of mr. bemis sitting in the corner of the room with a newspaper. his wife\\'s voice pierces the quiet.  helen\\'s voice henry? hen—ry?  bemis puts the paper down and forces a smile.  bemis yes, dear, i\\'m in the living room.  13. full shot the room as helen enters. this is a woman in severe clothes and severe shoes and a severe face. she strides purposefully over to henry, back hands the paper out of his hands.  helen do you want more coffee or don\\'t you?  bemis  no thank you, dear.  helen  then tell me that and don\\'t sneak off into the living room to bury yourself in newsprint! i think we‘ve gone over this quite enough, henry. i won\\'t countenance a husband of mine sacrificing the art of conversation—  (she stops, staring  at him) all right! what\\'s so funny?  bemis nothing dear. it\\'s just that that sounded sort of funny. a husband of yours. (smiles) how many husbands have you had? i\\'m the only one.  helen (throws the paper aside) i would appreciate that not being rubbed in: we\\'re playing cards tonight. i want you to change your shirt.  bemis cards?  helen (challengingly, ready to pounce) that\\'s quite right — cards! we\\'re going over to the phillips\\' house. (a pause) well, henry? anything to say?  bemis  (looks up at her  tiredly, takes off  his glasses and puts  them aside, rubs his  eyes) no, dear. nothing to say. what time are we due there?  helen in about fifteen minutes. that\\'s why i want you to change your shirt. try to look at least remotely respectable!  14. med. close shot henry as with open and blind eyes he feels around for the glasses.  15. close shot helen as she watches him, just a suggestion of some strange and almost malevolent enjoyment of his disability.  16. close shot henry\\'s hand as it gets close to the glasses. 17. close shot helen\\'s hand as it moves them away.  18. close shot henry as he finally reaches them, picks them up, puts them on. he looks up smiling at helen.  henry i\\'ll be ready, dear.  helen stares at him again with an undisguised dislike. she whirls around and walks out of the room.  helen see that you are!  19. full shot the room as henry rises, starts to walk out, suddenly stops, bites his lip in deep concentration, cranes his neck to look off into the foyer and the distant dining room to make sure he\\'s not being watched. then he goes over almost on tiptoe to the corner of the room to a small end table, opens the drawer, feels deep into the back of the drawer, and takes out a small pocket book. we can see its cover which reads, \"\"a book of modern poetry.\"\" he looks at the cover and smiles, puts it under his coat, then starts to walk out of the living room.  20. flash shot helen as he almost bumps into her. she stands towering over him like a prison guard.  21. two shot helen (cont\\'d)  (in a very soft voice) henry?  bemis (forces a smile) yes, my dear?  helen what have you got, henry? bemis got? helen got. bemis  why nothing, dear—  helen reaches in almost gleefully to take out the small pocket book hidden in his coat.  helen what\\'s this, henry?  bemis that?  helen  (nods)  this.  bemis  that’s odd. how did that get there?  helen i could only hazard a guess. (she looks at the cover and reads) \"\"a book of modern poetry.\"\" (a pause) yours, henry?  bemis nods miserably.  helen (cont\\'d) would you like to read me some, henry?  bemis (his eyes go bright) _ read you some? aloud? from the book?  helen do you want to?  bemis takes the book from her proffered hand.  bemis why...why, helen, i\\'d be delighted to. this has lovely things in it, (more)  bemis

should thank me, really! a grown man who reads silly, ridiculous, nonsensical doggerel!  bemes it isn\\'t doggerel! there were some beautiful things here-  helen i say it\\'s doggerel. i also say it\\'s a waste of time.  she grabs the book from him, rips at it with her hands, tearing out pages that flutter out. bemis goes down on his knees, grappling for the pages.  bemis helen, please. please, don‘t-  she continues to rip at the book and the pages continue to flutter down. his glasses slip off and once again he\\'s left groping in a world without sight.  24. angle shot looking up at

helen. there\\'ll come a moment when-  he leaves the rest unsaid.  helen (challengingly, ugly) when what, henry?  bemis when i\\'ll be forced to pay you back for twenty years of indignities, and cruelties, and misery—  helen throws back her head and laughs, a shrill, piercing, grating laugh which goes on for a moment then suddenly seems to die in her throat as she stares at the intense face of the little man in front of her and for the first time a look of concern crosses her face which boarders on fear. bemis goes down and picks up the rest of the pages, crumples them up in his hand, carries them over to a waste basket, puts them in. then he starts out the room.  helen henry—!  he stops but keeps his back to her. helen (cont\\'d)  are you going to change your shirt  now? we\\'ve only got a few minutes.  bemis slowly turns toward her.  .lala  bemis i\\'m going to bed, helen. i learned those poems by heart. i\\'m going to bed and say them to myself. and you can\\'t vandalize

(she rises, walks over to the newspaper where we see the kanamits\\' name in big black letters repeated over and over again along with his picture) how many of them are here now? anybody ever figured it out?  chambers  a few thousand, i guess. they\\'ve got embassies in every country now. and for every one that comes - a thousand of us take off in their ships to visit them.  (he shakes his head) that\\'s the odd thing. the fantastic ease with which human beings make adjustments. one day they watch with bated breath while a single person orbits around the world in a rinky— dink cubicle and they think of this as the most historic moment in the history of mankind. one year later they stand in line waiting to get into a space ship to take them a hundred million miles away in space and they act and react as if it were a weekend picnic in the country.

(she lights a cigarette) i\\'ve got a fair command of their spoken lingo already. it‘s not hard, really. and there are hints in it. some of the idioms are quite similar to english. i think i\\'ll get the answer eventually.  chambers more power! i gave up a month ago. they write in ideographs worse than chinese, but if i can help you in any way-  80. close shot pat as she moves away, a strange look on her face.  81. two shot  chambers (cont‘d) did i say something-  pat (shakes her head) if you could help me — that was the phrase, wasn\\'t it? chambers nods. pat (cont\\'d) the only thing you can help me with is— she looks off.  chambers is what?  82. different two shot as the girl faces him.  83.  84.  ll.  pat help me get rid of this strange little know inside me. this very funny persistent nightmarish feeling.  chambers nightmarish?  pat that\\'s right. a little sixth sense, if you will.  chambers that tells you what?  extremely tight close shot pat as she looks up at him.  pat that tells me that maybe we should have looked this gift horse in the mouthi  dissolve to:  int. huge hangar  with a long line of people, each carrying similar small handbags. there is a festive air even in the somewhat dark, cavernous aspect of the room. several signs point with arrows  and read:  \"\"loading platform this way.\"\"  85. moving shot down the line of people waiting. we hear little bits of dialogue.  man one they tell me they\\'ve got a mean temperature of seventy-six degrees on their planet and the sun never goes down...  women one and their clothing. it\\'s a metallic substance. just beautiful. kind of like a spun gold. and my sister says the day you land they take you on a conducted tour through all their shops and you can pick up as much of it as you want.  mmn two it\\'s just one big holiday when you get there. they\\'ve even got a form of baseball or something like it, leagues and everything just like here. man, i don\\'t think i\\'ll want to come back once i do get there...  woman two and the whole trip, and it\\'s millions of miles, mind you...the whole trip only takes just a few days.  the camera continues to pan down and in one very noticeable moment we see the soviet delegate standing there, all smiles, with a rather chubby wife. then we reach the end of the line and we see chambers standing there. the line starts to move and we hear the voices of excited delight.  voices of men #1 #2 woman #1 & #2 oh, we\\'re moving. good, we‘re ready to leave. isn’t this exciting? etc., etc.  86. different angle the line as they move through the hangar. 87. long shot across the tops of their heads  of a giant cavernous door which is now open as the people file through. a space saucer, landing ladder down, can be seen beyond open door.  88. moving shot chambers as he reaches a point close to the door. he suddenly hears pat\\'s voice calling.  pat mr. chambers? mr. chambersi  89. different angle chambers as he turns.  90. long shot across the room as pat runs toward him. she reaches him, out of breath, and pulls him to one side.  91. two shot  chambers (smiling) you‘re just in time to say goodbye.  pat (looks briefly toward the door) i know.

(continued)  continued:  (3)  martin you know, you look familiar to me, as if i\\'d seen you before.  charlie (shrugs) i got that kind of a face.  martin it\\'s been a long time. twenty years. that\\'s when i left here. (then he laughs at some collection of secret thoughts) i wish i had a buck for every hour i sat at this fountain though, from grammar school right through third year high. (then he turns and looks toward the front door) the town looks the same, too. (he turns back to charlie) really amazing, you know? in twenty years to look so exactly the same.  the soda jerk stirs the soda, carries it over to him, puts it down in front of him, takes a paper napkin, lays it  alongside.  charlie that\\'ll be a dime.  martin starts to fish in his pocket, then stops abruptly, then incredulously——  martin a dime? (he holds the soda up) three scoops?  charlie that\\'s the way we make them.  martin (laughs) you\\'re gonna lose your shirt. nobody sells sodas for a dime anymore.  charlie they don\\'t? where you from?  (continued)  continued: (4)  martin new york. (he takes a sip of the soda, spoons down some ice cream) you make a great soda.  he takes another swig from the soda.  charlie taste okay?  martin wonderful.  there‘s a few slurping sounds from the bottom of the glass as the last of the soda disappears. martin puts the glass back on the counter, looks around again.  martin  funny. how many memories you connect with a place. i always thought if i ever came back here -— it‘d probably be all changed.  (he looks around the  store) but it\\'s just as if i\\'d left yesterday.  (he rises and goes to the front door, stares out at the street) just as if i\\'d been away over night.  (he turns back, smiles toward the soda jerk) i\\'d almost expect mr. wilson to be sitting in the stock room and sleeping just like he always did before he died. that\\'s one of the images i have. old man wilson sleeping in his big comfortable chair in the other room. (he points to the far door at the other end of the room,then reaches in his pocket, takes out a dollar bill, takes it over to the counter, puts it down) thanks very much.  (continued )  continued: (5)  charlie (stares at the bill) that\\'s a buck!  martin (smiles, taps the glass then makes a motion to include the whole room) that.. and this, it\\'s worth it.  he turns, walks back to the door and goes outside. the soda jerk shakes his head as if just not understanding the complexity of that man, takes the glass, puts it in the sink. in doing so he notices a couple of open syrup containers, checks them, then walks over toward the door at the far end of the room. the camera behind him now, looks toward the room where a white haired man sits dozing in a big old— fashioned chair.  charlie mr. wilson?  the old man opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, smacks his lips, rubs his jaw —— part of a ritual of waking up.  wilson yup, charlie?  charlie we‘re gonna need some more chocolate syrup, mr. wilson.  wilson  (nods) i\\'ll order some this afternoon.  then he winks, grins, closes his eyes and goes back to sleep as we:  dissolve to: ext. residential street long shot looking down the street martin comes into the frame, his back to the camera. he stops, then turns profile to camera to look from house to house. there\\'s a smile on his face as if this too were part of a memory that all fitted into place.  15. track shot with him as he walks down the street studying the houses, nodding occasionally.

(continued)  19 . continued: (7)  he walks down the path and pauses near the clearing to the pavilion listening to the music.  60. close shot his profile as he listens and then smiles. he takes a few steps into the clearing, leans on a tree for a moment and slowly lets himself sink to the ground. he lies there with his hands behind his head staring up at the sky, listening to the band music. pretty soon quite unconsciously he begins to hum the tune that the band is playing and he is suddenly aware of someone else humming the tune in a boyish tone. startled, he bolts upright to a sitting position, looks to his right and there he sees martin the boy. the boy jumps up with a hushed, frightened cry and begins to run.  61. long shot looking down the path as the boy races down it and disappears around the bend. there is a beat and thenmartin appears behind him running after him.  62. moving shot through the crowd near the calliope as the boy pushes his way through people. a few feet behind him ismartin. the boy reaches the ticket taker stand and tries to force his way through.  ticket taker nope, son. not without a ticket, you don\\'t.  the boy whirls around staring at martin who has almost reached him now. he ducks under the turnstile and jumps on the merry- go—round. the ticket taker starts to shout and point toward him when suddenly he\\'s pushed aside by martin.  63. angle shot looking down on the merry—go—round as the man and boy thread their way past the horses that go up and down.  64-67. closer shots in between the horses first the boy\\'s face and then martin\\'s, first covered by the horses as they go up, then revealed as the horses go down. each time the boy\\'s face looks more and more petrified and frozen with fear and each time they appear and reappear martin is closer until suddenly we  cut to: 68. flash shot in this brief moment they are now face to  face with nothing between them.martin holds out his hands pleadingly -— supplicatingly.  martin marty, i don\\'t want to hurt you, son. i just want to tell you something -— martin! please. let me talk to you. let me tell you something.

(and then with great  compassion) the little boy... the one i know. the one who belongs here. this is his summer, martin. just as it was yours one time. don\\'t make him share it.  martin rises. he walks slowly down the steps, pauses at the foot and stares off into the night.  robert is it... is it so bad —— where you\\'re from?  martin  i thought so. i\\'ve been living...  i\\'ve been living at a dead run, dad.  i was so tired. and then... one day... i knew i had to come back. i had to come back to get on a merry—go—round and listen to a band concert and eat cotton candy. i had to stop and breathe and close my eyes and smell and listen.  robert (very softly) i guess we all want that. but, martin, (more) (continued)  24. continued: (12)  robert (cont\\'d) when you go back... maybe you\\'ll find that there are merry-go—rounds and band concerts where you are. maybe you haven\\'t looked in the right place. you\\'ve been looking behind you, martin. try looking ahead.  martin maybe. goodbye, dad.  robert nods and starts to walk away. he stops by the turnstile  and turns.  robert (gently) goodbye... son.  86. close shot martin as he stands there. he looks down at the wallet, taps at it thoughtfully with a finger and then slowly puts it inside his coat. then he turns and looks at the merry-go—round.  87. med. long shot his p.o.v.  of the horses. the lights go on suddenly, and there is the creak as the merry—go—round starts to turn. he climbs up on the platform and stands holding one of the posts that go up and down with the horses and starts to go around with it.  88. pan shot with him as he moves 89. pan shot of the calliope  where the music\\'s coming from.  abrupt cut to:  90. med close shot a juke box as it blares out rock—n—roll. pull back for  int. drugstore [day]  it\\'s the same drugstore we\\'ve seen except now it‘s done in chrome, leather and flash. it‘s plastered with advertising signs, suggesting the purchase of everything from filtered cigarettes to reducing pills and tranquilizers. the soda jerk is no longer charlie. martin comes in through the front door. he walks with a stiff gait and goes over to the soda  fountain.  soda jerk hi. something for you?

(a pause) and also like all men  perhaps there\\'ll be an occasion... maybe a summer night some time... when he\\'ll look up from what he\\'s doing and listen to the distant music of a calliope —— and hear the  voices and the laughter of the people and the places of his past. and perhaps across his mind there\\'ll flit a little errant wish... that a man might not have to become old —— never outgrow the parks and the merry-go—rounds of his youth.  (continued)  27. continued: (15)  (a pause) and he\\'ll smile then too because he\\'ll know it is just an errant wish. some wisp of memory not too important really. some laughing ghosts that cross a man‘s mind... that  are a part of the twilight zone.  now the camera pans back down the road to the sign that reads  \"\"homewood -- 1 1/2 miles.\"\"  fade to black.  \"\\r\\n14|Twilight Zone|Where is Everybody|October 2, 1959|\"1: \"\"where is everybody?\"\" written by rod serling  \\x0cact one standard road opening shot of the sky... the various nebulae and planet bodies stand out in sharp, sparkling relief. as the camera begins a slow pan across the heavens --  narrator\\'s voice there is a sixth dimension beyond that which is known to man. it is a dimension as vast as space, and as timeless as infinity. it is the middle ground between light and shadow -between man\\'s grasp and his reach; between science and superstition; between the pit of his fears and the sunlight of his knowledge. this is the dimension of imagination. it is an area that might be called the twilight zone. the camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot (each week the opening shot of the play). we are now looking down the small two-lane asphalt highway. it is dawn, the road is deserted save for a small diner on the left hand side. a broken neon light flashes on and off over the front door. from inside the sound of a rock-\\'n\\'-roll record lends a strange, raucous dissonance to the early morning silence. then the camera sweeps right for a long shot mike ferris who suddenly appears, walking down the road. his step is tentative, unsure. he\\'s a tall man in his thirties. his dress is nondescript, his only identifiable garment being army pants. there\\'s an indecisiveness, a puzzlement, in his features as he comes closer to the camera, sees the diner, stops, rubs his knuckles over the side of his face and feels his beard\\'s stubble. he pats in his pocket, unsure, reaches in and pulls out a couple of dollar bills. for some reason this buoys him up. he looks a little more resolved as he walks up the steps and into the diner.  \\x0cnarrator\\'s voice we are looking at a male caucasian, age approximately thirty-one, height approximately 5\\'11\"\". as to his name, where he is, and what he\\'s doing there -- this even he doesn\\'t know. for the journey that this man will take is an excursion into the shadows, and all of you are invited to go along. dissolve to: opening billboard int. diner it is a small, nondescript, typical eatery with a row of small booths along the outside window, a counter, and a kitchen beyond. the room is empty. pan shot mike as he walks over to a stool and sits down at the counter, reaches over, takes a menu, studies it for a moment, then turns and looks over toward the juke box. med. close shot jukebox garish, multicolored, still blaring out the music. med. shot room he turns on his stool to look toward the opening to the kitchen. close shot an oven inside kitchen through the glass we can see a row of six or seven pies baking and almost fully browned. med. shot room mike calls out.  \\x0cmike (sardonically calling out) is this thing loud enough for you out here? i mean, can you hear it all right? he grins wryly, waits momentarily for an answer that never comes, turns and looks again at the juke box. he rises, gets off his stool, goes over the juke box, looks all around it, pushes it away from the wall a few inches, reaches back, fiddles with a knob. the music goes much lower. then, satisfied, he pushes the machine back against the wall and goes back over to the counter. mike kind of early for that kind of music, isn\\'t it? still, silence. mike i noticed there\\'s a town just up the road. what\\'s the name of it? again, silence. mike puts the menu down, peers through the little opening to the kitchen. int. kitchen a small room with a couple of stoves, et cetera. he goes over to the stove, turns down the oven, and looks around the room. he goes over to a back door, tries it and it swings open. he steps back as it creaks open and reveals the diner\\'s backyard. mike (calls out) hey? you got a customer out front! hey! customer here! still no answer. mike turns, retraces his steps to the lunch counter. med. shot room mike still shows no real emotion beyond a puzzlement. he\\'s neither frightened nor concerned as yet. again he picks up the menu and studies it. he talks out loud, now.  \\x0cmike i think ham and eggs. eggs up and soft. hash browns. coffee. black. (looks up, calls out again) customer! got a customer out front! (he rises from the stool again -- sticks his head in the kitchen) ham and eggs. hash browns. coffee black. he stands there by the open, swinging door staring into the empty kitchen. his eyes dart about now and for the first time we see something beyond puzzlement on his features. what supplants it is irritation, not acute, but definitely there. he reaches into his shirt pocket and takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, goes back to the lunch counter. now he scratches his head, sits down on the stool for a long moment. suddenly the music on the juke box stops. the sudden cessation of noise brings with it a silence even more obvious. mike turns to stare at the juke box. he looks up at the clock. close shot clock it is on the counter near the coffee urn, its face turned sideways so that mike can\\'t see it. med. close shot mike as he goes over to the clock to turn it around and stare at it. close shot clock it reads a quarter to six. med. shot mike mike turns away from it, but in doing so brushes against it and knocks it to the floor. close shot clock on the floor as mike bends over and picks it up. the face of it is broken. he puts it back on the counter, then goes back over to his seat.  \\x0cmed. close shot mike his fingers tap a nervous staccato on the counter top. the silence now begins to be oppressive and nerve-racking. suddenly, as if an afterthought, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the money, looks at it in his hand, then reaches into all his other pockets. he finds nothing. he rubs at his face again. mike speaks aloud but obviously to no one in an attempt to make noise or sound or just to end the stillness. mike cash customer here. hungry cash customer. (he rubs his face again) i got two dollars and eighty-five cents. (he looks at the money very thoughtfully, almost questioningly) two dollars and eighty-five cents, american money. (then he stops and looks off in obvious puzzlement) american money. (he throws it out into the air as if to reassure himself as to the meaning of the phrase) sure, american money. he looks at the clock again, and into the opening to the kitchen and the swinging doors, at the silent juke box, and back at the money in his hand. mike well, we got this much settled. i\\'m an american. (he raises his voice a little now as if to wake someone in the next room) there\\'s a little question about my identity. let me put it to you this way -i\\'m not sure who i am. (he holds up the money) but i\\'ve got two dollars and eighty- five cents and i\\'m hungry. (more)  \\x0cmike (cont\\'d) this much is established! he gets up off the stool and suddenly slams both palms down hard on the counter, making all the salt shakers and catsup bottles quiver and rattle. mike (shouts) i got two dollars and eighty-five cents and i\\'m hungry! he stops dead now, listening to the silence that enfolds and surrounds him. then he looks around. again the sense of irritation. he takes a drag on his cigarette, then butts it out, rises, goes to the front door and stares out. ext. lunch room the long road that leads away from the lunch counter without a sign of traffic, people, or anything. he whirls around to look back into the lunchroom. mike (aloud) i\\'m gonna wake up in a minute. i know i\\'m gonna wake up. i wish... i wish there\\'d be a noise or something to wake me up. he suddenly sticks two fingers in his mouth and whistles, listens for a moment, then he whistles again, kind of grinning to himself. mike a little noise, please! (now he sings at the top of his voice) \"\"yes sir, that\\'s my baby. no sir, don\\'t mean maybe. yes sir, that\\'s my baby now!\"\" he laughs a little sheepishly, listens for a moment to the silence, then he turns and goes back to the lunch counter. int. lunch room mike sits down, buries his face in his hands, rubbing his eyes, massaging his temples as if trying to force out with  \\x0chis fingers some connective link... some reassurance of existence... some knowledge of where he is and what he\\'s doing. once again he looks around the room. pan shot with his eyes taking in the shots of the coffee urn, the menus, the salt and pepper shakers, all the simple, commonplace, terribly normal adjuncts to what should be a normal scene but somehow isn\\'t. he rises now, looks around again, then walks to the door. close shot the \\'open\\' sign on the door close shot mike as he slowly reaches down and turns the sign over to read closed. then he walks out. dissolve to: ext. town street mike\\'s p.o.v. it\\'s still early morning, and what we\\'re looking at is the main drag of a small town, flanked by stores, a courthouse, a post office, et al. the most singularly overwhelming feature of this is the complete absence of motion and all noise. long shot mike ferris as he walks down the sidewalk looking from one side of the street to the other. track shot past stores as mike goes by them. drugstore, grocery, soda bar. most of the doors are open and there are lights on inside, but there are no people. there\\'s an odd, indefinable feeling that permeates the scene, a sense of activity and yet coming with no players, and no people, as if it was a place full of motion and movement suddenly stripped of the people performing it. long shot down the street from mike\\'s point of view. it is devoid of any kind of movement whatsoever. it is absolutely quiet. over this  \\x0ctableau we superimpose the title, \"\"where is everybody?\"\" along with major credits. close shot mike as he stops and looks around. he is suddenly startled by the sound of chimes. he whirls around and looks up. long shot church steeple bell as it rings. close shot mike he shades his eyes to search out the church and then, in turning away from it, he stops abruptly, staring at something across the street. long shot across the street a little clothing store and alongside of it an alley where a large delivery truck is parked. in the cab, in the passenger- seat, a human figure can be seen. long angle shot looking down as mike goes to the curb, cranes his neck to look over to the truck. mike hey, miss? miss? (he makes a gesture that is part a wave, part an attempt at reassurance) over here, miss. look, i wonder if you could do me a favor? i don\\'t want you to think i\\'m nuts or anything. i mean, it\\'s nothing like that. it\\'s just that -(again he grins a little) i don\\'t seem to remember who i am. it\\'s the craziest thing. i\\'ve looked all around and i haven\\'t seen anybody around. i guess it\\'s just early or something. literally there hasn\\'t been a soul. (he takes a step off the curb, looks again toward the (more)  \\x0c(cont\\'d) cab of the truck, a little puzzled. he smiles again.) you know, it\\'s a real oddball thing but... well, i woke up this morning... (he stops and rubs his jaw) i didn\\'t exactly wake up. i just sort of found myself on the road walking. (and then suddenly) amnesia, that\\'s what they call it, isn\\'t it? amnesia? well that must be what i\\'ve got. i just don\\'t remember a thing... i can\\'t find anybody to ask... tracking shot as he starts to walk across the street. mike (as he walks) you\\'re the first person i\\'ve seen. look, i really don\\'t want you to be frightened or anything, but i was wondering if you could just tell me if maybe there\\'s a doctor or something. close shot mike as he stops dead in his tracks. he\\'s about ten feet from the truck. med. long shot the truck the female figure is outlined in the passenger seat but very much in the shadows. moving shot mike as he gets close to the cab. close shot profile female head flash close shot mike\\'s eyes as they suddenly narrow in reaction.  \\x0cclose shot mike\\'s hands on the door handle as he suddenly yanks the door open. med. close shot inside the cab the female figure suddenly slumps down in the seat, her head sticking out of the open door, the hair cascading down. the camera pans slowly across her body until it stops at what should be arms. there are no arms. mike reaches over, grabs at the hair of the figure and pulls it up and around, to stare into the wooden face of a mannequin. he very slowly lets loose and the mannequin tumbles back onto the seat and then down to the floor of the cab. close shot floor he mannequin staring up with glassy, manufactured eyes. med. shot mike as he slowly backs away, then turns to read the lettering printed on the side of the truck. close shot lettering it reads, resnick\\'s store mannequins. close shot mike as his lips form the words that he\\'s read. then he turns to look through the window of the cab at the figure of the mannequin, he takes a few steps over to her and then very gently picks her up and sets her back on the seat. mike i\\'m very sorry, madame. i can assure you that at no time did i mean to be so upsetting. as a matter of fact i\\'ve always had a kind of secret yen for quiet women. (then he grins) you get what i mean, babe? (he kisses his fingertips and then plants them on the mannequin\\'s nose) now don\\'t take any wooden boy friends. then he looks at her again for a more pensive moment as if  \\x0cunspoken now were his earnest wish that this creature was alive and could be talked to. he turns away and walks back across the street. long shot mike as he walks. series of shots mike walking in different sections and on different streets. the last scene ends with him stopping abruptly to stare at something down the street. long shot gas station out in front is a glass-enclosed public phone booth. long angle shot looking down at mike as he walks toward the gas station and goes into the phone booth. mike look, i wonder if anyone there could tell me -he stops abruptly, grins, shakes his head, slaps at the side of his head with an open palm, fishes in his pocket and takes out a coin, deposits it in the phone, then dials the operator. he listens to the dial tone that comes on and off with dull regularity. he jiggles the receiver impatiently. mike operator. operator. will you listen to me? he pounds on the phone and then just indiscriminately dials a bunch of numbers. he\\'s about to throw down the phone in disgust when suddenly at the other end of the line he hears a dial tone ringing. he very slowly and very gratefully picks up the phone now and hears a voice filtered at the other end. voice (filtered) this is the special operator. (more)  \\x0cvoice (cont\\'d) the number you have reached is not a working number. please make sure you have the right number and are dialing it correctly. mike starts to shout into the phone. mike is everybody asleep over there? what kind of operation do you people run? then she repeats all she\\'s just said as mike listens to her, excited beyond words that he has found someone alive. when she finishes repeating the message he grabs the phone and is about to speak when suddenly he hears the operator\\'s voice again. voice this is a recording. there is a certain suggestion of tenseness that suddenly shows on mike\\'s face. voice (filtered) this is the special operator. the number you have reached is not a working number. please make sure you have the right number and are dialing it correctly. mike a recording? (he pounds on the receiver hook and shouts) operator! look, all i want to know is where i am. i just want to know the name of this place. then he slowly lets the receiver loose and it hangs down from the phone box. mike\\'s hand touches and then grasps a telephone book, a thin one that he grabs and looks at hungrily. close shot telephone cover on it is written oakwood.  \\x0cmed. shot mike he rips open the cover, looks down at the first page. mike a. abel. ackerman. adams. allenby. arnold. all right, boys, where are you? (his voice is a little edgier now) where do you all live? just in this book here? (he rips the page open) baker. beldon. biltmore. botsford. well, look, gang -- who\\'s watching the store? he suddenly turns to look out at the street. full shot the street mike\\'s p.o.v. med. close shot mike mike who\\'s watching any of the stores? he lets loose of the phone book now, lets it fall to the floor, and stands there motionless for a moment, deep in thought. then he automatically reaches for the door handle, turns it, and pushes. nothing happens. he tries again and it remains locked. he waits a moment, then puts all his weight against it. it does not yield. it is more than irritation that we see on mike\\'s face now. there\\'s the first suggestion of a real concern. he looks around his strange, glass prison. mike all right. who\\'s the wise guy? who locked the door? (he tries the door once again) it\\'s a great gag. he pounds again and then suddenly stops and looks all around. pan shot from mike\\'s p.o.v. from inside the phone booth. the camera moves all the way  \\x0caround the glass, almost in a three hundred and sixtydegree pan. med. close shot mike he laughs softly, shakes his head. mike trapped in a phone booth! trapped in a glass phone booth, like a goldfish. (then he suddenly calls out) well, here i am! you got me! everybody come see! i\\'m right here on display! long angle shot looking down at mike in the phone booth, as once again he starts to pound on the glass. mike how about a hand, somebody? a little assistance -- how about it? this is an absolutely hysterical town, and i\\'m growing very fond of it, but i\\'d appreciate it if -he stops abruptly. close shot mike\\'s face as he stares at something through the glass. close shot a cigar half-smoked and still burning, lying on the sidewalk just outside the booth. angle shot looking into mike\\'s face through the glass. for the very first time there\\'s a look of incipient fear. mike look. whoever\\'s out there. this isn\\'t funny any more. you understand? i don\\'t like this jazz. it\\'s getting dull. (he looks around again) (more)  \\x0cmike (cont\\'d) look, i know i can be heard. i know... i know somebody\\'s watching me. immediately after he\\'s said this he realizes he has suddenly given voice to his fear. he\\'s labeled what is beginning to bother him. simply a sense of being watched. he suddenly bends down, picks up the phone book, flings it against the glass of the door. the glass disintegrates. mike sticks his hand through, opens the door from the outside, then kicks at it with his foot. it springs open and halfway off its hinges as he goes out onto the street. then he looks down at his hand. it\\'s cut; a rivulet of blood runs down through the fingers. he feels for a handkerchief, takes it and wraps it around the hand. he squeezes it a couple of times, trying to get more blood to flow. then he starts down the street again. long shot street mike\\'s p.o.v. once again the sense of emptiness and loneliness and that bizarre quality of activity with no actors. track shot with mike as he continues down the street he pauses in front of a building and looks up. close shot sign which reads, police station. track shot he walks up the steps and into the building. int. police station there\\'s a small anteroom, and then an open, barred door which leads to a corridor lined with cells. med. close shot mike as he enters and looks around. there is a police sergeant\\'s desk, files, pictures of wanted men on the wall. a teletype machine hums in the corner. mike goes to look at it. the light over it is on, but nothing is being written. he whirls around and stares toward the sergeant\\'s desk, goes behind it, picks up a microphone, fingers it for a moment,  \\x0cthen talks into it. mike calling all cars. calling all cars. unknown man walking around the police station. suspicious looking character. probably wanted by the fbi -then he stops, looks at the mike, chuckles softly for a moment and then stops abruptly, the smile gone. he flings the microphone away from him and looks slowly around the room. mike i wish i could shake that feeling... (he looks around again) that crazy feeling of being watched... listened to... he stares toward the cell doors then begins to walk slowly toward them. close shot mike as he stands in the middle of the next room, looking from empty cell to empty cell. then he whirls around at a bubbling sound. there, on a hot plate, is a pot of coffee perking. behind him we see the barred door leading to the anteroom begin to close. mike\\'s eyes look wild, as if subconsciously he realizes he\\'s in danger. he whirls around to see the cell door closing and then, with a shout, throws himself against it, pushing it away before it locks. he seems to hang on it now, breathing deeply. mike all right, time to wake up! time to wake up now! he whirls around, his face distorted, close up against the camera. he shouts. mike time to wake up! he stumbles through the anteroom and then back to the street.  \\x0cext. street long angle shot looking down at mike as he stands in the middle of the empty street, the stores around him, the quiet. he suddenly screams. mike where is everybody? where is everybody!? fade to black: end act one  \\x0cact two fade on: film clip a hot and high afternoon sun shimmering in a sea of heatwaves. the camera sweeps down until it is level with the street and a long shot mike ferris as he sits on a curb, staring dully and numbly across at nothing. the church steeple clock sounds two. he looks up, listens to it, but is no longer shocked by it. he just lets the sound of the chimes play along the edges of his consciousness without really being aware of them. now he rises and walks slowly, methodically, without much apparent purpose across the street. he looks up to see a sign reading drugstore. he enters. int. drugstore it is light and cheerful inside. on the left hand side is the soda bar with a big mirror behind it full of stickers advertising various concoctions -- soft drinks, ice cream, sandwiches. mike, as he enters, pauses by the cigarette and candy counter. he looks through the glass for a long moment, then reaches behind and takes out a couple of cigars. he unwraps one, sticks it in his mouth, lights it, takes a couple of draws, butts it out, reaches in another box, takes one of those, then looks in the box. mike two for a dollar. now that\\'s more like it. i always like an expensive cigar. then he turns with a smile and says to nobody. mike how about you guys -- any of you want a cigar? series of shots of empty booths med. close shot mike as he gets up on a stool.  \\x0cmike i\\'ll take a chocolate soda with chocolate ice cream. he starts to laugh, but the laugh is checked almost immediately as he sees his reflection in the mirror the counter. his fingers run exploringly across his taking in the beard stubble, the hollowness beneath eyes, the strange, haunted, frightened look that is there. he looks at himself again for a long moment.  behind face, the obvious  mike you\\'ll forgive me, old pal, but i don\\'t recollect the name. the face seems vaguely familiar... but it\\'s the name that escapes me. (a pause) i\\'ll tell you what my problem is. i\\'m in the middle of a nightmare that i can\\'t wake up from. (he points to the reflection) you\\'re part of it. you and the ice cream and the cigar. that police station and the phone booth. that little mannequin. this whole bloody town, wherever it is. (a pause) whatever it is. i just remembered something. scrooge said it. you remember scrooge, old buddy? ebenezer scrooge? it\\'s what he said to the ghost, jacob marley. he said, \"\"you may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an undone potato. there\\'s more of gravy than of grave about you.\"\" you see? that\\'s what you all are. you\\'re what i had for dinner last night. you must be. but now i\\'d like to wake up. i\\'ve had it... i\\'d like to wake up now. and if i can\\'t wake up, at least i\\'d like... i\\'d like to find somebody to talk to. he rises now and goes behind the counter. he starts to fix himself a chocolate soda, experimenting with some of the cupboards until he finds the right ingredients, the ice cream, the milk, et cetera. then he mixes himself a soda,  \\x0ctall, frosty, delicious. he starts to sip it with a straw as he walks around the drugstore. he stops by a poster of a high school football schedule. close shot cardboard sign it reads, oakwood high school, 1958 schedule. a list of teams and dates to be played appears below. med. close shot mike as he takes it in one hand and reads it as he sips the soda. but the normality of it suddenly points out the incongruity of what he\\'s living through. he puts the poster back on the counter, shaking his head, staring at it. mike i must be a very imaginative guy. very imaginative. nobody in the whole world can have a dream as... as complete as mine. right down to the last detail. (he taps the poster) right down to the last detail. he turns, stares across at a big magazine rack near the front window of the store. he crosses over to it, stares down at some of the magazines, then kneels down, interested. he begins to trace the dates on each one of the magazines. the majority of them say october 1958 and his mouth forms that phrase, \"\"october 1958.\"\" then he bites his lips, shakes his head again, rises, looks down at the group of comic books, each with a lurid title having to do with horror themes, spook themes, et cetera. then suddenly he stops and looks down at one, the cover of which is peeping out from behind the others and whose title is visible. he reaches down and pulls it out just a few inches farther so that he can read the entire title. tight close shot cover the title: the last man on earth. med. shot mike he picks it up and stares at the cover, then flings it down on the floor. he turns rapidly away and heads back to the  \\x0ccounter where he puts the soda down. he is suddenly gripped by another spasm of such utter loneliness that it forces him out onto the street. ext. street camera follows him out of the store. as he gets out on the street he suddenly shouts, shrilly, illogically. mike (shouting) hey! hey, anybody! anybody hear me? anybody hear me? he almost lurches to the other side of the street where he buries his face against the window of a building. when his head goes back he sees the letters u.s. post office and he starts to laugh again. mike any mail for me? anybody write me a letter? i don\\'t know what my name is, but maybe you can tell me in there, huh? will you tell me what my name is? he pounds his fist against the glass to stifle what obviously is a sob as to the loneliness and to the unknown gnawing fear that envelops him. then window, struggling for composure.  and then suddenly has he begins to give in and to the pulsating, he turns away from the  close shot mike he looks at something across the street. camera sweeps wide until it stops on -long shot building with a sign reading city bank. long shot mike as he gets up off the bench, walks across the street, and into the bank. int. bank  \\x0ctrack shot mike as he walks past all the tellers\\' cages. he stops at the end of the line, presses his face against the bars. close shot row after row of stacked bills med. shot mike mike i\\'d like to borrow about eight hundred thousand dollars. how about it? (then he nods and grins) thanks. i think that\\'s generous of you. i think that\\'s really generous. he pulls the bars up, reaches in and takes two packages of money. then he starts to retrace his steps toward the front door. he\\'s about to leave when he looks toward the first teller\\'s window. med. shot rows of coins on top of the counter med. shot mike he takes some of the bills that he\\'s crammed into his shirt pocket, throws them away. mike gotta make room for some silver. he goes behind the teller\\'s window and starts to cram rolls of coins into his pockets. then suddenly his eyes look wild again as he looks up, his eyes scanning the room. and again, illogically, the same mixture of wisdom and paranoia. mike somebody watching me? he goes out in front of the teller\\'s cage again and looks around. mike somebody watching me? he looks up toward the ceiling and around as if expecting to see someone.  \\x0cmike crazy feeling. crazy, odd-ball feeling. like... like i knew someone was watching me. and then his eyes narrow again in an awareness of danger. mike watching me... and trying to button me up someplace. trying to trap me. he looks around wildly again. close shot his legs as he starts to run toward the door. he trips over some sort of a lever close to the teller\\'s cage. flash shot alarm bell on the wall as it begins to ring. long angle shot looking down at mike as he stops by the front door and whirls around as the loud, dissonant clanging pierces the quiet. then he whirls around and tries the front door again. it\\'s locked. series of flash shots bell. teller\\'s cage. locked door. mike\\'s hand. mike\\'s face. track shot mike as he races toward the alarm on the wall. he grabs the wires that extend from it and suddenly yanks on them, pulling them apart. the bell abruptly stops. then he whirls around and stares at the front door. close shot door it is now ajar. med. shot mike as he goes back toward the teller\\'s cage, grabs the coins and bills, crams them back into his pocket. he walks toward the open door, then out onto the street again, leaving a  \\x0ctrail of silver and bills behind him. he sits down on the curb, unwraps the handkerchief from around his hand, wipes his face with it. he reaches into his pocket, takes out a crumpled fistful of bills, takes one out, grins at it, takes out the remnants of a cigar, sticks the cigar in his mouth, takes the bill, lights it. mike here\\'s something i\\'ve always wanted to do. always wanted to do this. he takes the lit bill and lights a cigar with it, then he lets loose of the burning bill and watches it flutter to the ground and disappear in ashes. mike watches it burn, and then slowly his face looks tired, hopeless. mike big deal. so what? big deal. he lets his head hang a moment. dissolve to: ext. town square [night] tight close shot street lamp as it suddenly goes on. camera then pans down for a shot of mike on a bench looking up toward the light. then he turns to look toward the street flanking the square. the lights have gone on in front of all the stores and in the windows. close shot mike reacting. med. long shot theater marquee as the lights go on around it. track shot mike he walks across the street, stops by the ticket window, and then, almost dreamlike, speaks.  \\x0cmike i\\'d like one tick -then he stops, shakes his head, closes his eyes, realizing how ludicrous this is. he is about to go in when he suddenly stops and stares at a poster advertising the movie. close shot poster which shows an air force pilot in his coveralls advertising the movie. med. close shot mike as he suddenly feels his own outfit and gradually makes the connection that the uniform of the man in the picture is similar to that which he wears. mike air force. air force. (then he whirls around, looks up toward the sky) air force. i\\'m air force. (he once again looks down at his coveralls and feels them, grabs at them) air force. i\\'m in the air force. track shot mike as he walks from the outside of the theater, through the lobby, on into the interior. mike (shouting) hey, everybody. i\\'m in the air force. i remember that much. i\\'m in the air force. does anybody hear me? i\\'m in the air force. and then once again he rubs his eyes, runs a hand wildly across his face and then suddenly surveys the theater. cut to: full shot the theater there are enough lights on to cast a soft orange glow  \\x0cthrough the room. he looks around at the absolute, vast emptiness of the place. then he sits down, checks his watch, looks up at the big white screen with nothing on it. he looks at his watch again and then settles down in the chair, his eyes closed, and he starts to succumb to the fatigue that sweeps over him. mike air force. what does that mean? was there a bomb or something? is that what happened? that must have been it, a bomb. but if there was a bomb -(he looks around the empty theater now) it would have destroyed everything. and nothing is destroyed. suddenly he is aware of the lights lowering. he starts and his eyes open wide in time to see the last of the lights go down. a long beam of white light shines from the projection booth and suddenly on the screen appears a big introductory title, cartoon parade, with appropriate march music. mike leaps to his feet, looks from the projection booth down to the screen. he suddenly starts to run down the aisle, shouting. mike hey! hey, somebody up there? he stops in front of the projectionist\\'s light so that we get an almost -- nightmarish picture of the cartoons partially showing on his face and body as he screams. mike hey, somebody up there? who\\'s running the pictures? can you see me? can you see me up there? hey! then he races back up the aisle, arriving at the rear of the theater. he looks wildly around, then he sees a door with a glass window, steps visible on the other side. long angle shot stairs as he races up them.  \\x0cint. projection booth as he bursts inside. the picture is running from one of the two projectors, but the room is absolutely empty. mike races over to the machine, bends down and peers at it as the film goes through and he hears the sound of the cartoon music and voices. this is too much for him. he throws himself against the wall, peering out of the small, circular hole that the picture shoots through. long angle shot through the hole of the vast, empty theater. int. projection booth he turns away, goes out the door, stumbling down the steps. angle shot down stairs he continues down the steps and out into the lobby again. int. lobby he stops for a moment and looks across the lobby. med. long shot popcorn machine that is at this moment making popcorn. close shot mike as he closes his eyes, shakes his head. then he opens them. his eyes go wide. he starts to run toward the camera, coming up very close and almost at the point of impact we cut away to: tight two shot of mike and a mirror as he smashes his face and hands against it and then recoils from the reflection, backs off a few feet, and then looks at the mirror on the opposite side of the room. the combination throws off reflections almost to infinity. he looks from left to right staring at the hundreds of mike ferrises who ape him in his every movement. then he stops and looks across at the refreshment stand where the popcorn continues to pop in the big  \\x0ccontainer. this, too, is more than he can stand. his face screws up like a small child about to cry, and then he shouts. mike oh my god. oh my dear god! he stumbles through the lobby and out into the street. ext. street he stumbles down the street aimlessly now, intent only on moving, not finding. his footsteps start to drag and finally he stops, sits down on the curb, buries his face in his hands, rubs his eyes. then he looks up to once again find himself looking through the drugstore window, the magazine that he\\'d been reading lies on the floor face up. high angle shot looking down through the window, distorting the cover of the magazine in such a manner as to make the lettering appear big and irregular. once again the title slaps at him across the face. the last man on earth. he rises slowly, backing away from the window, shaking his head. he turns and races across the street. suddenly, then, he stops abruptly as the light on the corner changes to red and he instinctively comes to a halt. and then he stops dead, realizing once again the ludicrousness of it. he begins to laugh -- the laughter becomes convulsive, wild. all the way across the street he continues it. track shot as he goes by all the stores that we\\'ve been introduced to. as he goes by each one a sound emanates from it, a sound way out of proportion to what it actually should be. when he passes the pool hall we hear the mammoth bowling alley sound echoing from it. from in front of the theater comes a cacophony of music and laughter. from the drug store there is a fizzling, bubbling sound of drinks. from the record store, the dissonant, blaring sound of music. as each noise joins in it becomes mumbled and part of a big morass of noise. gradually the very dimension of it so frightens and shocks mike that he begins to back away from each store as he  \\x0cpasses -- it as if being assaulted on all sides. he stumbles against a street post, whirls around, frightened, stares at it, and then suddenly, almost supplicatingly, throws his arms around it, buries his face against it. he starts to sob. mike won\\'t somebody help me? won\\'t somebody please help me? then his sobs subside and he stands there, breathing deeply. his eyes slowly open. sweat stands out on his features. he looks haggard, desperate, close to cracking. the noise somehow, for no apparent reason, suddenly stops and there\\'s a deep, dead, all-pervading silence again. mike\\'s eyes travel up the post, stare up toward the sky. he squints against the sun. mike who\\'s watching me? who\\'s looking at me? (screaming) who\\'s looking at me? he looks down toward the street. long shot the street he moves to the middle of the road again, still looking up toward the sky, and then as if suddenly seeing an adversary, begins to run. close shot store window as mike backs into it, trying to get inside, reaching for the door and missing, and then slamming his face against the front pane. close shot mike\\'s face and eyes looking from inside the store outside toward him. his eyes go wide and he starts to scream. close shot over mike\\'s shoulder at a huge eye looking at him.  \\x0cmed. shot mike as he starts to run away from the store again. the camera takes in a shot of an optometrist\\'s sign with a huge eye that mike had seen. track shot mike as he runs back toward the post. he grabs it and holds on tight, then he looks down. his hands have touched a button and he looks down at it. tight close shot a button with a sign over it: push to turn green. med. shot mike as he looks away toward the light. close shot the light med. shot and then suddenly mike slams the palm of his hand against the button and punches it over and over again. mike somebody help me. help me. help me. close shot the light as if flashes from red to green, from green to red, from red to green, over and over again. close shot mike\\'s hand as he keeps pushing the button. his voice, sobbing, screeching, plaintive, frightened. mike somebody help me. please. please, help me -dissolve to: out of focus on his hand  \\x0cclose shot in focus his hand pushing a button on an instrument panel. the camera dollies away until both the back of the panel and mike\\'s face are on a small television screen. long angle shot down a line of officers in a viewing room as they intently watch the screen. we hear mike\\'s voice as it coincides with a red light that flashes brilliantly on and off over the viewing screen. mike\\'s voice please. please help me. help me. a general, obviously in command, turns to his aide on his right. general clock him! (and then turning to his left says to the officer alongside) get him out of there, quick! officer two reaches over for a hand mike. pushes the button. officer two release the subject! on the double! int. large hangarlike room in the center of it, illuminated by a couple of spots in an otherwise dark room, is a small, hermetically sealed metal box about six by five feet and about five feet high. a sliding panel is pushed back. several air force men reach down and start unstrapping mike and then carefully lift him through the hole. a white-clad medical officer begins to remove electrodes that have been taped to his body at various points. by this time mike has stopped speaking. his eyes are half closed. he breathes deeply and irregularly, slumps forward in his seat. close shot his right fist smashed against the instrument panel.  \\x0cextremely tight close up his fist and the broken glass covering a clock on the panel which reads six fifteen. med. group shot the air force men as they remove him. air force man one be careful. he\\'s cut his hand on that clock glass there -long shot general and staff as they hurriedly approach the scene, their footsteps ringing hollowly on the concrete floor. medical officer he\\'s all right, sir. delusions of some sort. i guess that\\'s it. he\\'s coming out of it now. general (nods) fine. you get all your data recorded? medical officer yes, sir. every bit of it. general (to officer one who comes up from behind) did you get him clocked? officer one yes, sir. four hundred and eighty four hours, thirty-six minutes. general good. i\\'d like to get a look at all the data when they\\'re compiled. i\\'d like the reaction chart on him, too.  \\x0cofficer two (sotto) the press, sir? he points toward the opposite side of the room. long shot three or four members of the press as they stand waiting expectantly. group shot general and the others general on the run, if they don\\'t mind. i want to talk to ferris. officer two yes, sir. he motions toward the press, and beckons them over as the general, the medical officers, and the others start walking in the opposite direction toward mike ferris, who lies on a stretcher at the very far and opposite side of the room. track shot with the general and the reporters as they join him and start to walk across the room toward ferris. reporter one you consider it a success, sir? general very much so. he\\'s been alone in that box for something in the neighborhood of four hundred and eighty four hours, which is roughly equivalent to a trip to the moon, several orbits, and then back. reporter one and this then was a simulated trip to the moon? is that right, general? general (nods) for all intent and purpose.  \\x0creporter two what about the wires attached to him? general electrodes. all of his reactions have been charted and graphed. respiration, heart action, blood pressure. at this moment they reach a point some ten feet away from where mike ferris lies on a stretcher attended by a couple of medics. their voices become low. reporter three what happened to him toward the end? just before he pushed that button or whatever it is. general what happened to him was that he cracked. we assume delusions of some sort, but i\\'ll tell you something, gentlemen -- you spend two and a half weeks all by your lonesome in a five foot square box without ever being able to hear a human voice other than your own... i\\'ll give you especially good odds that your imagination would run away with you too, just as his obviously did. one of the medics looks up, motions the general over. the general takes a few steps until he\\'s very close to mike. general how do you feel, son? mike (his voice is weak but he\\'s obviously much improved now) i feel much better, sir. i\\'m sorry about... toward the end. medical officer (close by) what was it like, ferris? where did you think you were?  \\x0cmike (looks from one to the other, wets his lips) some place i don\\'t want to visit again. a town... a town without people. without anybody. medical officer and you had to get out of that town, didn\\'t you? mike (nods) i sure did. (then he looks up toward the medical officer) what was the matter with me? just off my rocker, huh? medical officer just a kind of nightmare, ferris, that your mind manufactured for you. the reporters lean forward straining to overhear this conversation. medical officer you see, ferris, we can feed stomachs concentrates. we can supply microfilm recreation, reading, even movies of a we can pump oxygen in, waste material  with for sort. out.  the camera now moves around so that it is shooting just over the heads of all the men assembled and is looking at the box in the background which is on the periphery of the light. medical officer but there\\'s one thing we can\\'t simulate. that\\'s a pretty basic need -- man\\'s hunger for companionship, the barrier of loneliness. that\\'s one we haven\\'t licked yet. at this moment the medics help ferris to his feet. he stands there motionless for a moment as if testing newfound legs, and then he looks out toward the open hangar door at  \\x0cthe night sky. mike next time though... it won\\'t be just a box and a hangar, will it? general (going to his side and looking out toward the sky with him) no, mike. next time you\\'ll really be alone. there\\'s a long, thoughtful silence as mike takes a few steps toward the hangar door. he pauses for a moment near the box. a side has been removed so that he\\'s staring directly into the control panel where the broken clock can be seen still reading six fifteen. close shot mike as he reacts. close shot cockpit as the camera pans over the broken clock, a microphone which hangs by the cord, a small microfilm apparatus, et cetera. med. close shot mike as he looks away and then continues to walk over to the hangar door. he slowly looks up toward the sky and the camera sweeps up for a long shot of the moon hanging bright and lustrous in the sky. mike (grins thoughtfully, stares up toward the silver orb, and then quietly) don\\'t go away up there. next time... next time it won\\'t be a nightmare or a dream. next time it\\'ll be real. so don\\'t go away... we\\'ll be there in a little while. then he starts to walk out in the night followed by the others. the camera begins a slow pan back into the room until it is shooting on the box, squatting empty and  \\x0cimpassive in the empty room. narrator\\'s voice the barrier of loneliness. the palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. lap dissolve to: night sky the moon and the stars. narrator\\'s voice up there... up there is the vastness of space, in the void that is sky... up there is an enemy known as isolation. it sits there in the stars waiting... waiting with the patience of eons... forever waiting... in the twilight zone. fade to black: the end  \\x0c \"\\r\\n15|Twilight Zone|Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up|May 26, 1961|\"the twilight zone will the real martian please stand up?  written by rod serling  \\x0cact one fade in on a brief montage of snow-covered mountains and woods on an island somewhere in the northeastern united states, accompanied by some odd noises -- what sounds like it could be an alien spaceship flying overhead and crashing into an ice-covered pond. snow falls throughout. wipe to two state troopers, padgett, the veteran, and perry, a younger man, flashlights in hand as they peer into the darkness of the woods. the snow continues to fall. trooper padgett see anything? trooper perry the tops of some trees have been knocked down. looks like something hit that pond. whatever it is, it\\'ll be under the ice till next spring. trooper padgett a meteor or something, probably. i\\'d better check in. that woman who phoned said something about calling out the national guard. he opens the door to their patrol car and grabs the radio mike. trooper padgett (into the mike) this is one-one-eight-three-a, one-oneeight-three-a, reporting a check out. dispatcher go ahead. trooper padgett (to the dispatcher) checking out a report on an unidentified flying object. supposed to have landed in the area of hook\\'s landing. appears something cut off the tops of some trees.

(to perry) yeah? trooper perry there\\'re footprints up here. they come up from the pond. looks like they got out of whatever landed. trooper padgett (to the dispatcher) there appears to be some evidence that -well, we\\'ll call you back. dispatcher what\\'s it all about? trooper padgett we don\\'t know yet. dispatcher how\\'s that? trooper padgett we\\'ll, uh -- we\\'ll call you back in a little bit. dispatcher all right, padgett. but there\\'s some talk of a bridge going out up there. when you can, you better take a look and make sure she\\'s posted and blocked off. enough ice jammed up against it to cool the congo.  \\x0ctrooper padgett roger and out. padgett shuts the car door and joins perry by the tracks. light from a roadside diner glows in the distance. trooper perry no question about it. something left that pond and went over to the diner. trooper padgett looks like a bus in front of that diner. you don\\'t suppose it came out of that pond, do you? trooper perry very funny. trooper padgett sorry. let\\'s leave the car and follow these tracks. i want to be sure they lead to the diner. the troopers walk through the woods, following the tracks with their flashlights, oblivious to the omniscient narrator they pass along the way. the narrator wears a stylish overcoat, carries a lit cigarette, and speaks directly to the audience. narrator wintry february night, the present. order of events: a phone call from a frightened woman notating the arrival of an unidentified flying object, and the checkout you\\'ve just witnessed with two state troopers verifying the event, but with nothing more enlightening to add beyond evidence of some tracks leading across the highway to a diner. you\\'ve heard of trying to find a needle in a haystack? well, stay with us now and you\\'ll be part of an investigating team whose mission is not to find that proverbial needle. no, their task is even harder. they\\'ve got to find a martian in a diner, and in just a moment you\\'ll search with them, because you\\'ve (more)  \\x0cnarrator (cont\\'d) just landed... in the twilight zone. fade out fade in on the empty old bus (marked \"\"cayuga bus company\"\") parked just outside the diner. we pan to the front of the bus to include a view of the diner\\'s large front window (\"\"hi-way cafe\"\") through which we can see that the place is filled with customers. the troopers arrive, look over the bus, and enter the diner. perry and padgett walk inside the diner, brush the snow off their uniforms, and scan the customers: a middle-aged married couple, smoking cigarettes; the bus driver, drinking coffee; a young married couple, rubbing noses; a no-nonsense businessman with his coat draped over his shoulders; all seated at tables. seated at the counter, hunched over a bowl of chili so that his face can\\'t be seen, is an old man we\\'ll call grandpa. opposite grandpa is the diner\\'s counterman who looks at the troopers with concern. counterman (to the troopers) trouble? padgett glances over at another customer, seated at a corner table, an extremely attractive blonde, blowing cigarette smoke. the troopers exchange looks with one another and then address the crowd. trooper perry who\\'s bus is this out here? driver (putting on his cap) that\\'s mine, officer. what\\'s the problem? trooper perry the bridge up ahead has been declared temporarily impassable. ice floe stacked up against it. (more)  \\x0ctrooper perry (cont\\'d) another pound of weight and it could be driftwood. driver that\\'s rough. can\\'t turn around and go back. there\\'s a slide up there at the turnoff. blocked the whole road. counterman (takes toothpick from his mouth) looks like you\\'re kind o\\' marooned. trooper perry till morning anyway. businessman till morning? i\\'ve got to be in boston at nine a.m. driver (to the businessman) then you better start walking, mister, \\'cause that bus stays out there till they fix the bridge. either that, or have \\'em drop some snowshoes. trooper perry so, you might as well get comfortable and get a little hot food in ya. businessman oh, that\\'s just great. that\\'s fine, isn\\'t it? get comfortable and get a little hot food in you. that\\'s precious little consolation for missing my meeting in boston. (rises, laughs, crosses to the driver, and sits at his table) that\\'s a fine little bus line you work for, isn\\'t it? they care so much about their schedules, don\\'t they?  \\x0cdriver i wouldn\\'t be too hard on \\'em, mister. they have no control over the snow, bridges, the sides of hills that decide to come down. that\\'s pretty much out of their hands. the troopers scan the customers again. trooper perry (quietly, to padgett) what do you think? trooper padgett they were all on that bus, weren\\'t they? counterman (to the troopers) what\\'s the trouble? you looking for somebody? trooper padgett (crosses to the driver) driver, um, have you got a passenger manifest? driver passenger manifest? what do you think i got parked out there? a 707? mister, that\\'s a fourteen year old bus and business is lousy. my boss\\'d run rum across the border if there was a profit in it. i don\\'t ask passengers their names. we kiss \\'em gently and help \\'em in. we\\'re that glad to have \\'em, with or without names. trooper perry know how many you had? driver six. unless one of \\'em fell out the window when we hit a bump. i picked up six and i\\'m supposed to deliver six. trooper padgett (glances around) nobody fell out. (more)  \\x0ctrooper padgett (cont\\'d) somebody must\\'ve jumped in. there\\'re seven here now. driver (rises, silently counts the customers) that\\'s funny. i know i had six people. padgett crosses to the counter, where the counterman sets down a cup of coffee for him. trooper padgett (to the counterman) thanks. now, tell me, was there anybody in here before the bus stopped? counterman no, i haven\\'t served anybody since eleven o\\'clock this morning. i figured this whole bunch got off the bus. driver we did. there was no one in here when we came in. trooper perry then how do you account for seven people? driver that one beats me. (it dawns on him) one of them didn\\'t get off the bus. (sits back down) trooper perry which one of you wasn\\'t on the bus? businessman (annoyed) we were all on the bus. what kind of interrogation is this, anyway? if we\\'re going to be grilled, i want to talk to a lawyer. the old man at the counter cackles and turns around, his wild-eyed face visible for the first time.  \\x0cgrandpa that\\'s a good one. first, he wants snowshoes, then he wants a lawyer. businessman (pointedly, to grandpa) i don\\'t remember seeing you on the bus. grandpa (to the businessman) that\\'s quite funny, \\'cause i don\\'t remember seeing you neither. (winks at the driver) makes one of us a liar, don\\'t it? grandpa and the driver laugh at this. this is it make whether hundred gestapo  businessman preposterous. what difference does who was on the bus or who wasn\\'t or there were six or seven or a and twenty? is this a diner or headquarters?  counterman (to the businessman) aw, now take it easy, mister. (to the troopers) what\\'s it all about? trooper perry (to the counterman) did you hear anything flying over here tonight? haley flying over here? no, i didn\\'t hear anything. trooper perry we got a call about two hours ago. woman said she heard something fly over and then come down.  \\x0ccounterman fly over here? from where? trooper padgett from up there. (rolls his eyes heavenward) an unidentified flying object. counterman unidentified flying object? (chuckles) nothing\\'s come down from up there \\'cept snow. that\\'s all i\\'ve seen for the past fourteen hours, snow. where\\'d she say it came down? trooper perry close to here. trooper padgett look, something did land in tracy\\'s pond. left a trail of broken branches before it hit. we found tracks leading away from it. counterman to where? trooper padgett to here. counterman (amused) you mean something landed in tracy\\'s pond and then came in here? that\\'s crazy. nothing\\'s come in here since eleven this morning. nothing, except... driver except me and my passengers. me and six people. that means that one person here... now it\\'s the driver\\'s turn to look heavenward. it\\'s an unsettling thought.  \\x0cyoung wife (quietly, to her husband) george, i don\\'t like this. young husband easy, honey, easy. old husband (to the troopers) now, let me get this straight. you\\'re trying to tell us that there\\'s one person in here who landed in some kind of a saucer or something and then came in here? blonde came in here with us? padgett nods. businessman well, that\\'s just not possible. we\\'d\\'ve seen them. old husband not necessarily. it\\'s snowing and dark. we climbed off of that bus with our eyes closed to get out of the snow. anyone could\\'ve come in with us and we wouldn\\'t\\'ve noticed. trooper padgett you were all on the bus together. you would have known who the other passengers were. driver well, that don\\'t cut any ice. they loaded in the snow at hook\\'s landing. tell you the truth, i don\\'t know who got on. grandpa she\\'s just like a science fiction, that\\'s what she is! a regular ray bradbury! six humans and one monster from outer space. (to the businessman) you wouldn\\'t happen to have an eye in the (more)  \\x0cgrandpa (cont\\'d) back of your head, would you? the driver cracks up. businessman (to grandpa) look, i find you offensive, you know that? grandpa winks at the driver. blonde (to padgett) what do you do now, officer? trooper padgett (to the blonde) look, lady, this isn\\'t exactly par for our courses either. we go off on a lot of nutty assignments, but this one -- wow! blonde well, i know how you begin. you pair off the couples. since it\\'s just one person who doesn\\'t belong here, you... you eliminate the couples. the older couple smile and nod their heads. old husband (a little smugly) we\\'re exonerated. cross us off. we\\'re two of the humans. young husband us, too. my wife and i. we\\'re in the clear. he clutches his wife\\'s hand with its ringed finger. but his wife looks at him doubtfully. young husband (to his wife) what\\'s the matter?  \\x0cyoung wife i-i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin. young husband a mole on my chin? connie, i never had a mole on my chin. old husband (rises) i can tell you what\\'s going to happen. we\\'re all going to get so panicky that everyone and his brother will start picking up invisible clues from everybody else. this is nonsense. (sits) old wife well, of course, it\\'s nonsense. if a husband and wife suddenly start wondering whether the husband is really the husband and the wife... is ...really... now, this wife looks doubtfully at her own husband. old husband (indignant, to his wife) now, wait a minute! i think twenty-three years is long enough for a woman to know who she\\'s married to -- so, i\\'ll thank you to stop looking at me as if i just put on this face as part of a costume. not entirely reassured, the old wife puffs on her cigarette nervously. grandpa (laughs) i love this. she don\\'t know who he is. he don\\'t know who she is. we don\\'t know who she is. and this lemon-sucker here (points to the businessman) -- he\\'s the most suspicious of the bunch. again, the driver can\\'t help but laugh at grandpa. the businessman shakes his head in disgust.  \\x0ctrooper perry (to the counterman) have you got a back door to this place? counterman sure. why? trooper padgett go back there and lock it. counterman well, it\\'s already locked. if that certain somebody really is from outer space, they\\'ll just go through the wall anyway. grandpa (waves his hat, to the troopers) check \\'em for wings! check \\'em for wings! look under their coats! the driver busts out laughing again. perry is getting a little fed up with grandpa\\'s outbursts. trooper perry (crosses to grandpa) you got identification, grandpa? grandpa (pauses and squints at perry) left it down in the pond in my spaceship. trooper perry (to grandpa) who won the world series race last year? businessman what is this, a sort of prolonged practical joke? grandpa (to all) i get it! i get it! (to perry) pittsburgh pirates won it -- took four out (more)  \\x0cgrandpa (cont\\'d) of seven from the yankees. (to all) sharp boys, real sharp boys! (to perry) didn\\'t figure us martians would know nothin\\' about the great american pastime, did ya? huh? huh? grandpa cackles. the blonde laughs at him. trooper padgett (crosses to the blonde) you got identification, miss? blonde well, no, as a matter of fact, i don\\'t. i left my wallet -- i left it in my suitcase. it was shipped on ahead. trooper padgett what\\'s your name, miss? blonde ethel mcconnell. i\\'m a... professional dancer. grandpa how many legs? how many legs? blonde i\\'m gonna belt you, grandpa. driver (grinning, to the troopers, with certainty) she was on the bus. trooper padgett how do you know? driver (looking her over) she\\'s the only one i noticed.  \\x0cblonde (smiling, to the driver) well, thank you. grandpa but who noticed him? the driver laughs again, but stops -- realizing the joke\\'s on him. grandpa (to the driver) how do we know you\\'re the same one driving the bus? huh? (to all) ain\\'t nobody been exonerated yet, that\\'s for sure! businessman look, let\\'s cut this farce out right now. we\\'ll all show our identifications and put a stop to it. the whole thing\\'s ridiculous. old husband (arms folded, to the businessman) then, how do you explain the extra person in here? old wife yes, how about that? businessman very simple. the driver is mistaken. seven people got on the bus and he thought there were only six. trooper padgett (crosses to the driver) is that possible? driver not a chance in the world. i counted heads before we took off.  \\x0c(pointedly, to the businessman) there were six people. trooper padgett (crosses to the blonde) miss...? the jukebox suddenly lights up and starts blasting a record. all eyes turn to it. just as suddenly, the music grinds to a halt. the lights in the rest of the diner begin to flicker on and off. padgett puts a hand on his holstered gun, ready for anything. after a moment, things return to normal. but everyone is slightly spooked. counterman what caused that? perry inspects the jukebox. trooper padgett (to all) we, er, we may get a laugh out of all this in the morning. in the meantime, everyone stay right where they are. the blonde, grandpa, and the driver glance nervously overhead. the businessman looks discouraged. the older married couple look around at the others. the younger couple looks at one another. and the counterman can\\'t believe this is happening. fade out end of act one  \\x0cact two fade in on the inside of the diner, later that night, as the counterman emerges from the back, wiping his hand. he sees the driver now seated with the blonde at her table. they seem to be enjoying one another\\'s company. counterman (to the driver) where\\'re the troopers? driver hm? oh, stepped outside. (peers out the window) snow stopped. (to the counterman) say, haley... (points to the jukebox) that wasn\\'t your gag, was it? i mean, the business about the jukebox starting like that. counterman (puts up his hands, retreats to behind the counter) not me! i\\'m strictly short orders and \"\"pay your taxes\"\" -- i don\\'t know anything about science fiction. a jukebox is a jukebox and if that thing wants to start up all on its own, you\\'ll check with an electrical engineer. grandpa gets a fiendish glint in his eye, rises from his stool at the counter, and approaches the jukebox. abruptly, he straightens up and salutes it. grandpa (to the jukebox) take me to your leader! (laughs, to all) take me to your leader! grandpa calms down a little as the troopers enter the diner. the two married couples, quietly napping at their  \\x0ctables, awaken. padgett sits at the counter across from the counterman. counterman (to the troopers) find anything? trooper perry no. took a look at the bridge. trooper padgett holding up pretty well. driver i know that bridge, and what\\'s more, i don\\'t trust it. businessman (to the driver) well, thank goodness we needn\\'t concern ourselves with your judgment. if the bridge gets a clean bill of health, you\\'ll drive that bus right across it. driver (to the businessman) listen, mister. you may be a big shot in boston, but when it comes to bridges and busses, i got seniority. and i tell you, that bridge is so old that at any -the lights go out. everyone looks around nervously. blonde hey, what is this? (the lights come back on) why did the lights go out like that? counterman we may be losing power. the jukebox starts up again, startling grandpa and trooper perry who stand beside it. counterman this is weird. this is just plain weird. the jukebox dies again. the tension in the room thickens.  \\x0cblonde well, i wish whoever it is would play his cards right now. young wife (agitated) why don\\'t they do something? what\\'s the point of us all staying cooped up in here like this and.... the young husband comforts her. trooper perry (to the young wife) the point is this, miss. we\\'re all kids in a closet here. nobody understands what\\'s going on. if there was some kind of a saucer that landed in that pond, and he did come in here, i think it\\'d be a real healthy idea if we pinpointed that particular somebody and kept him from leaving. counterman makes sense. maybe whoever it is, is invisible. maybe they\\'re just playin\\' around. cat and mouse. businessman that is childish nonsense. old husband it\\'s as good an explanation as any i\\'ve heard. but what if the... the thing doesn\\'t show itself? do we just sit here holding our breath? old wife yeah, how \\'bout that? grandpa well, if somebody was to ask me--  \\x0cbusinessman (interrupts, sharply) well, no one did ask you. no one will. grandpa stops short, mouth open. blonde (offended, to the businessman) why don\\'t you leave the old man alone? businessman who invited you into this? blonde well, i didn\\'t realize we were waiting for invitations, but you\\'ve got this big thing about bossing everybody around. grandpa nods in agreement. old husband look, it\\'s tough enough just sitting here without-abruptly, the lights flicker off and on, off and on, for a long, eerie moment. as soon as the lights come back on, the sugar bowls on the two married couples\\' tables suddenly flip over. the wives scream. padgett and perry draw their guns and cover the doors. trooper padgett (to grandpa) get over there and sit down, gramps. grandpa sits at the counter. the businessman glances at the diner\\'s pay phone just as it rings. padgett answers it on the second ring. trooper padgett (into the phone) yeah? ... what\\'s that? it\\'s okay? ... all right, thanks. (hanging up, to all) the bridge is okay.  \\x0cbusinessman well. it\\'s about time. shall we go? the troopers re-holster their guns and confer. trooper padgett what do you think, perry? trooper perry can\\'t hold \\'em. grandpa (to perry) you\\'re making a big mistake, officer. big mistake. you\\'re lettin\\' the monster out. trooper perry that may well be, old man. may well be. you can\\'t hold somebody on suspicion of being a monster. (to the driver) you can roll \\'em anytime. driver (to padgett) all right. are they sure about that bridge? i don\\'t like that sucker. she swings in the wind and she\\'s not a suspension. trooper padgett (jerks a thumb at the phone) that was the county engineer. the bridge has been checked out and declared passable. we\\'ll go on ahead, cross the bridge first. some of the customers begin rising to leave.  counterman (relieved, moves to the cash register) all right. you can pay your checks right over here, ladies and gentlemen. godspeed and safe trip. and y\\'all come back and see us again, y\\'hear? (more)  \\x0ccounterman (cont\\'d) that is, all but one of ya. everyone begins to rise, collect their things, and move to the cash register. counterman (to grandpa) you had the chili, right? that\\'s ninety cents. thank you. (to the businessman) and you had, what? fourteen cups o\\' coffee, that was a dollar forty... dissolve to outside the diner, trooper padgett and the driver stand on either side of the bus door as the travelers board the bus. grandpa is already seated up front as the older married couple board, followed by the blonde. blonde (to padgett) goodbye, officer. trooper padgett (casually salutes her) miss mcconnell. padgett and the driver watch with much interest as the blonde boards the bus, keeping a close watch on her shapely legs. once she\\'s safely aboard, padgett and the driver exchange satisfied glances. driver (to padgett) well, i counted seven. trooper padgett that\\'s right, seven. grandpa betcha by the time we get to boston, there\\'ll be seventeen! grandpa laughs as we dissolve to inside the diner, some time later. the jukebox cues up a  \\x0crecord and begins to play. cut to the outside of the diner. through the front window, we see that the place is empty except for the counterman. the businessman, his coat still draped over his shoulders, trudges through the snow, stops to peer at the counterman through the window, then walks inside the diner, and sits at the counter. the counterman, doing some bookkeeping, is surprised to see him. counterman something for ya? businessman coffee. black. counterman one coffee, black. (pours coffee) hey, uh, didn\\'t you, uh, what i mean is... didn\\'t you go out on that bus? (serves the coffee) businessman i did indeed. oh, yes, i went out on that bus. and you know something? that bridge wasn\\'t safe. it collapsed. the state police car, the bus, everything -- kerplunk -right into the river. it was a terrible scene. no one got out. counterman (incredulous) except you. businessman except me. lucky, i guess, huh? counterman very lucky. but... but... businessman but what?  \\x0ccounterman you\\'re not even wet. businessman wet? what\\'s \"\"wet\"\"? counterman what do you mean \"\"what\\'s wet\"\"? you landed in the river but you\\'re clothes are all dry. businessman an illusion, that\\'s all. just an illusion. like that jukebox playing in the corner. that\\'s an illusion, too. the counterman looks at the jukebox and it abruptly stops playing. silence. businessman or that telephone ringing. the phone rings. businessman that\\'s an illusion. just a parlor trick. counterman what are ya, some kind of magician? a third arm emerges from under the businessman\\'s coat. using his three hands, he takes from his pockets a box of cigarettes and a book of matches. businessman who, me? oh, hardly. the counterman stares in amazement as the three-handed businessman lights a cigarette. businessman now, uh, before you, uh, faint dead away, i ought to explain that the name isn\\'t really ross. and i wasn\\'t really going to boston. no, i was sent as a kind of advanced scout. you know these, uh, cigarettes, do you call them? they taste wonderful. (more)  \\x0cbusinessman (cont\\'d) we haven\\'t got a thing like this on mars. that\\'s, incidentally, where i come from. we\\'re beginning to colonize. my friends will be arriving very shortly. i think they\\'re going to like it here. lovely area, so... so remote, so pleasant, so off-thebeaten track. just the perfect spot for a colony, don\\'t you think, mr. haley? while we\\'re waiting, how about a little what you call music? counterman i don\\'t mind. i have to do a little waiting myself. you see, mr. ross, my name isn\\'t haley. and i do agree with you, this is an extraordinary place to colonize. we folks on venus had the same idea. we got it several years ago. and i think i really ought to tell you now that your friends are not coming. they\\'ve been intercepted. oh, a colony is coming. but it\\'s from venus. and if you\\'re still alive, i think you\\'ll see how we differ. the counterman removes his cap, revealing a third eye in the middle of his forehead. the businessman\\'s face sours at this. counterman and i agree with you about what they call music. why don\\'t you play some? the counterman busts out laughing. narrator (voice over) incident on a small island, to be believed or disbelieved. however, if a sour-faced dandy named ross or a big, good-natured counterman who handles a spatula as if he\\'d been born with one in his mouth, if either of these two entities walks onto your premises, you\\'d better hold their hands -all three of them -- or check the color of their eyes -- all three of them. (more)  \\x0cnarrator (cont\\'d) the gentlemen in question might try to pull you into... the twilight zone. pan up from the outside of the diner, dissolve to a starry sky, and fade out.  \\x0c \"\\r\\n'"
