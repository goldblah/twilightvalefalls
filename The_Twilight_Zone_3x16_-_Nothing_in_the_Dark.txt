THE TWILIGHT ZONE
"Nothing in the Dark"
Written by
George Clayton Johnson

ACT ONE
FADE IN and PAN DOWN to a large, darkened BASEMENT ROOM in
a decrepit tenement building, just before sunrise. Through
the half-boarded up windows, falling snow is visible. The
room is cluttered with worse-for-wear furniture including a
table with a teapot on top, an ornate mirror, and, against
one wall, an old-fashioned bed.
The bed is surrounded by wooden chairs that are meant to
act as a sort of makeshift barrier. In the bed, an old
woman sleeps, white-haired and wrinkled. Her name is WANDA
DUNN. Just outside her window, at street level, the figure
of a uniformed police officer appears and crouches near a
lamp post, apparently taking cover while he observes
someone or something across the street from the tenement
building. The sound of BREAKING GLASS from the street
awakens Wanda. She looks up, fear in her face, and turns to
the window. The backs of the wooden chairs cast shadows on
her that resemble prison bars. She sees the policeman and
tenses up.
Pushing a chair aside, she puts on a pair of slippers,
rises from her bed, and crosses to the only door, to make
sure that its locks are secure. Satisfied, she turns to the
window where the policeman still waits and watches. A NOISE
from the street stirs the policeman who rises and
disappears from view. Wanda wraps a shawl around herself
and breathes a sigh of relief at his departure.
She is on her way back to bed when a piercing WHISTLE
blows, followed by two loud GUNSHOTS. Startled, Wanda turns
to see and hear the policeman stagger into view and fall
from street level, down a flight of steps, to just outside
her door. She moves to the door, fearfully, and presses
herself against it. The policeman’s gasping voice calls
out. His name is HAROLD BELDEN.
BELDEN
(offscreen)
Help. Please, help.
WANDA
Who is it? Go away.

BELDEN
(offscreen)
I’ve been shot. I need help.
WANDA
Who are you?
BELDEN
(offscreen)
Officer... Police... Please, open the door.
I need help.
She makes no move to help him.
WANDA
You’re lying to me. I know you. You can’t
fool me.
BELDEN
(offscreen)
Help.
WANDA
You’re lying. You’re no policeman. Why
can’t you leave me alone? I know who you
are. I know what you are.
Her chin trembles. A FAST PAN off of Wanda reveals the
ornate mirror opposite her -- in which stands the
omniscient NARRATOR, wearing a suit and tie.
NARRATOR
An old woman, living in a nightmare. An old
woman who has fought a thousand battles
with death and always won. Now she’s faced
with a grim decision. Whether or not to
open a door. And in some strange and
frightening way, she knows that this
seemingly ordinary door leads to the
Twilight Zone.
FADE OUT
FADE IN on Wanda, still pressed against the door.

BELDEN
(offscreen)
Won’t somebody help?
Wanda hesitatingly opens the door -- but leaves the chain
bolted. Through the crack, Wanda sees the handsome, young,
uniformed officer Harold Belden lying on his back in the
snow, gasping for breath, and in great pain.
BELDEN
Unless... you help me, I’m going to die. II don’t think I can move.
WANDA
Don’t say that. It isn’t fair. You’re
trying to trick me.
(abruptly)
Don’t move. I-I-I-I’ll close the door.
BELDEN
What? Listen, I’ve been shot. I’m bleeding
to death. Please. My name is Harold Belden.
I need a doctor. Please, call the hospital.
WANDA
I haven’t got a telephone. I’d have to
unlock the door. You can’t ask me to do
that. I don’t want to die. You understand?
I know who you are.
BELDEN
(incredulous)
You’re not going to help me? You’re going
to let me die? I don’t understand. But -(wincing in pain)
It hurts... It hurts...
WANDA
Stop. Stop. Why do you torture me? It isn’t
fair.
BELDEN
I can’t move. It hurts.

WANDA
It isn’t fair. It isn’t fair.
But she knows she has no choice. Reluctantly, Wanda
unchains the door and lets it swing wide open. She
hesitates a moment and then scurries OUTSIDE to Belden,
bends down, and touches his shoulder. In awe, she draws her
hand away, looks at it, and then stares at Belden.
WANDA
I’m still alive.
A wave of joy sweeps over her face. At once, she helps
Belden to crawl into her room. Once safely inside, she
quickly shuts and locks the door.
DISSOLVE TO
Wanda’s BASEMENT ROOM, a few minutes later. Belden rests in
a bed on the opposite side of the room as Wanda’s. Wanda
fixes him some hot tea.
BELDEN
Listen, you should try and get some rest.
Really, I feel much better. When the doctor
gets here, he’ll take me off your hands.
Belden sees the tense expression on Wanda’s face.
BELDEN
You didn’t call the doctor?
Wanda shakes her head.
BELDEN
Why not?
WANDA
I haven’t got a telephone.
BELDEN
But couldn’t you go to one of the
neighbors?
WANDA
There aren’t any. They’ve all moved away.
Trucks came and took away their furniture.
(MORE)

WANDA (CONT'D)
First one, and then another. And... eveneven if I could call the doctor somehow, I
couldn’t take a chance and let him in.
Don’t you see? It might be him.
BELDEN
Him?
WANDA
Mister Death. I know he’s out there. He’s
trying to get in. He comes to the door and
knocks. He begs me to let him in. Last
week, he said he came from the gas company.
Oh, he-he-he’s clever. After that, he
claimed to be a contractor hired by the
city. I knew who he was. He said this
building was condemned, that I’d have to
leave. I kept the door locked. Then he went
away. He knows I’m on to him.
BELDEN
Mister Death? Is this a person, like you or
me?
WANDA
I know it sounds crazy. But it’s true. I
know it’s true.
BELDEN
People die all over the world. Now, how
could one man be in all those places at
once?
WANDA
I don’t know. Don’t ask me that. Maybe
there is more than one. Maybe...
Wanda breaks down in tears. Belden reaches out to her,
touches her arm.
BELDEN
Please. Don’t cry. I... I don’t want to
hurt you. Please. I-I’m sorry. There.
Wa2nda rises, pours a cup of tea, and hands
it to Belden who sips from it throughout
the following

WANDA
At first, I couldn’t be sure. It was a long
time ago. I was on a bus. There was an old
woman sitting in front of me, knitting.
Socks, I think. There was something about
her face. I felt I knew her. Then this
young man got on. There were empty seats,
but he sat down beside her. He didn’t say
anything but... his being there upset her.
He seemed a nice young man. When she
dropped her yarn, he picked it up. Right in
front of me. He held it up to her. I saw
their fingers touch. He got out at the next
stop. When the bus reached the end of the
line... she was dead.
BELDEN
Hm. But you said yourself, she was an old
woman.
WANDA
But I’ve seen him since, several times.
I’ve seen him crowds, I’ve watched for him.
Every time someone I knew died, he was
there. Once he was a young soldier. A
salesman. A taxi driver. Someone you
wouldn’t notice unless you were watching. I
wondered why I could see him. And that no
one else could. Then, I knew. It was
because I was getting older... and my time
was coming. I could see clearer than
younger people could.
BELDEN
All right. But if you knew what he looks
like, then why be afraid? You could avoid
him.
WANDA
Because his face is always different. I
couldn’t be sure.
BELDEN
How about when you go out? Now, couldn’t he
touch you then, if he wanted to?

WANDA
I never go out.
BELDEN
Never?
WANDA
I haven’t been out for years.
BELDEN
Well, what do you do about food?
WANDA
A boy delivers it. I leave him money and a
list. And I always wait until he’s gone
away before I unlock the door.
BELDEN
How can you live like this?
WANDA
But if I don’t live like this, I won’t live
at all. If I don’t watch out, if I let down
even for a moment, he’ll get in. I know he
will.
She looks around at the dark room.
WANDA
I haven’t always lived like this. I was
young once. People said I was pretty. I
lived out in the sunlight.
(touches her face)
People said I’d spoil my fine complexion. I
didn’t care. I loved outdoor things. I
lived out in the sunlight.
Wanda looks down and sees that, beside her on the floor, a
small patch of sunlight has found its way through her
boarded up windows. She reaches out and puts her hand in
its warmth.
WANDA
I’ve always hated the dark and the cold.
I’m old. I’ve lived a long time. But I
don’t want to die.
(MORE)

WANDA (CONT'D)
I’d rather live in the dark than not live
at all.
Belden leans forward to hand her his empty teacup and
winces in pain.
BELDEN
Here. There’s nothing to be afraid of.
We’re alone here. And there’s nobody at the
door. You need some rest-The pain becomes too much for him and he leans back in his
bed.
BELDEN
And I need help.
At a loss as to what to do, Wanda rises and walks away from
him, wringing her hands. She closes a cabinet door, sits on
a table, and paces nervously about. Suddenly, her attention
is drawn to something outside a window. A burly MAN is
walking down the stairs to her door. He KNOCKS. Belden
gives Wanda a look, but she is paralyzed with fear,
clutching her bed frame, and shaking her head. The KNOCKING
continues throughout.
WANDA
No.
BELDEN
There’s nothing to be afraid of. You’d
better answer it.
Wanda moves slowly to the door.
BELDEN
Go on. That’s right. Go ahead. Go ahead,
answer it.
Wanda leaves the chain on, but opens the door a crack. The
burly man’s face appears. He tries to push the door in.
MAN
I’m sorry, lady, but I’ve got my orders.
Wanda panics and tries to slam the door shut, but the man
gets his foot in.

MAN
I can’t fool around any longer.
He’s too strong for her. The chain breaks and he forces the
door in and Wanda collapses to the floor. She lies
completely still. Is she unconscious? Dead? The man moves
to her body at once and places his hand on her neck.
FADE OUT on the image of the man’s HAND is this the touch
of Death?
END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE IN on the man standing over Wanda, minutes later. She
is in her bed now. And the man is rubbing her hand as she
regains consciousness.
MAN
Easy, lady. Just lie quiet till you get
your strength back. You gave me quite a
scare when you caved in like that.
Wanda stares at the man’s face and then at her hand in his.
WANDA
And still I live.
MAN
Well... You’ve got to understand, ma’am. II don’t get no pleasure out of bustin’ in
doors. You don’t seem to realize how
important this is. I’ve got a crew and
equipment coming in an hour to pull this
tenement down. Beggin’ your pardon, ma’am,
but it’s long overdue. I-I’m surprised it’s
still standing.
WANDA
And you’re really... not Mister Death?
MAN
I don’t know what you’re talking about. All
I know is I got a contract to demolish this
row of buildings. Everybody else moved out
long ago. Until the other day, I thought
this building was deserted. I-I seen them
windows boarded up and I-I figured you
moved when the rest of them did.
WANDA
You want me to go outside? You want me to
leave here? I can’t.
MAN
You were notified months ago, right? I’m
just trying to do my job. These buildings
were condemned by the city and I’m the one
(MORE)

MAN (CONT'D)
who’s got to tear them down.
WANDA
How can you?
MAN
This building has had it. It’s worn out.
Used up. All these buildings have got to
come down.
Wanda clutches the bars of her bed frame in a way that
suggests she is trapped in a cage.
MAN
I ain’t a monster, lady. I’ve got a heart
just like anybody else, but, uh -- I can
see how you could get attached to a place
and not want to see it wrecked but when a
building is old, it’s dangerous. It’s gotta
come down to make room for a new one.
That’s life, lady. Old make room for the
new. People get the idea that I’m some kind
of destroyer but -- They think I get kicks
out of, uh, tearing stuff down. That ain’t
the way it is. I just clear the ground so
that other people can build. In a way, I
help them do it. Look around, it’s the way
things are. A big tree falls and new ones
grow right out of the same ground. Old
animals die and young ones take their
places. Even people step aside when it’s
time.
WANDA
I won’t.
Wanda suddenly notices that her door is wide open.
WANDA
The door!
She rises at once and shuts it. The man confronts her.

MAN
There’s no need in...
Wanda turns from him and presses herself against the door.
MAN
What’s the sense of locking a door that
won’t even be here in an hour? If you’ve
got any possessions you’d want to keep, II’d move them out. I’ll help ya.
Wanda turns to glare at him.
MAN
Now, look, I’ve been trying to go easy but
if you insist on staying here, I’ll have to
call a cop. Please cooperate, lady.
The mention of the police reminds Wanda of something. She
leaves the door and crosses halfway to the mysteriously
silent Belden, still lying in bed on the other side of the
room.
WANDA
(to herself)
Of course.
(to Belden)
Explain to him. Tell him the reason I can’t
go out there. You’ll help me, won’t you?
Belden merely looks at her, saying nothing. The man joins
Wanda in the middle of the room and stares right at Belden,
but is somehow unable to see him.
MAN
(to Wanda)
What are you doing? Who’re you talking to?
WANDA
(to the man)
Mister Belden is a policeman.
(to Belden)
Please tell him.
But Belden remains silent. And the man sees no one. The man
looks at Wanda as if she’s crazy.

MAN
(to Wanda)
I’m sorry, but if you’re still here when
the crew arrives, I-I’ll have to call a
cop.
The man crosses to the door, opens it, pauses to look back
sympathetically at Wanda, then exits, leaving the door wide
open. Wanda watches him go, then turns to Belden.
WANDA
Why didn’t you help me?
She hurriedly crosses to the door.
WANDA
I thought you understood.
She shuts the door and, as she does so, it begins to dawn
on her. She turns back to Belden.
WANDA
You. He looked right at you... and didn’t
see you.
(full realization)
No!
BELDEN
Look in the mirror, Wanda.
Wanda turns, walks to the ornate mirror, and looks. In the
mirror, Belden’s bed is empty. She turns quickly to see -and a FAST PAN reveals -- Belden still lying in the bed.
WANDA
You tricked me! It was you all the time.
BELDEN
Yes. I tricked you.
WANDA
But why? The moment I let you inside, you
could have taken me. Anytime. But you were
nice. You made me trust you.
Slowly, Belden sits up in bed, no longer in pain.

BELDEN
But I had to make you understand. Am I
really so bad? Am I really so frightening?
You’ve talked to me. You’ve confided in me.
Have I tried to hurt you?
Belden rises.
BELDEN
It isn’t me you’re afraid of. You
understand me. What you’re afraid of is the
unknown. Don’t. Don’t be afraid.
WANDA
But I am afraid.
Belden takes a step toward Wanda.
BELDEN
The running’s over. It’s time to rest.
(offers his hand)
Give me your hand.
WANDA
I don’t want to die.
BELDEN
Trust me.
WANDA
No. No.
BELDEN
(gently)
Mother...
(steps forward)
Give me your hand.
An odd expression crosses Wanda’s face. Very slowly, she
takes his hand. Belden smiles.
BELDEN
You see? No shock. No engulfment. No
tearing asunder. What you feared would come
like an explosion is like a whisper. What
you thought was the end is the beginning.

WANDA
When will it happen? When will we go?
BELDEN
Go? Look.
He nods toward her bed. She turns and sees... her body
lying on the mattress, a peaceful smile on its face. She
turns back to Belden and grins.
BELDEN
We have already begun.
Belden opens the door and leads Wanda to the doorway. The
room magically darkens behind them as Belden offers Wanda
his arm and she takes it. They walk into the sunshine, up
the stairs, and down the street, chatting amiably.
NARRATOR
(voice over)
There was an old woman who lived in a room
and, like all of us, was frightened of the
dark. But who discovered in the minute last
fragment of her life that there was nothing
in the dark that wasn’t there when the
lights were on. Object lesson for the more
frightened amongst us -- in or out of the
Twilight Zone.
PAN UP and DISSOLVE TO to a field of stars in a night sky
and FADE OUT.
