0|rgoldblatt|after life|May 2018|"death looked through the eye sockets in his skull at the spectre in front of him. what had once been a fine adventurer was now only a spirit, partially opaque and glowing at the edges. he still wore the clothes he died in, leather armor over a loose-fitting shirt and pants. his hair was shaggy, and it looked like he hadn't shaved before he died. death could not see any wounds, so hopefully his passing had not been too unpleasant. the former adventurer stood sheepishly in front of death, like a child about to receive a reprimand. ""you're early, reckless,"" said death in surprise. ""yeah,"" reckless said, rubbing the back of his neck with his hand, ""about that."" death sat back in his throne and waited for the inevitable request. the spirit straightened and took in a deep breath.  ""i want another chance at life."" ""no,"" death answered flatly. ""hear me out,"" the former adventurer begged. ""i wasn't done yet."" ""no one is ever 'done,'"" death responded emphatically, ""but passing is unavoidable."" ""you said i was early."" ""true,"" said death, ""but i have been known to be wrong about timing before, though."" he looked over the adventurer again, but could not find a clue to his demise. ""how did you die?"" he asked quietly.   as far as reckless was concerned, the quest had been a success. he had been sent to find the sacred object by the king of the land, who wanted to make sure it was secure and out of the hands of any adversaries. reckless found it, vanquished a couple monsters on their way to kill him, and even managed to save a maiden from a nearby village. he hadn't died, which was enough reason for him to celebrate. now all that was left was to pass off the object to the king's messenger, drink the night away, and start a new quest in the morning.  all around reckless, villagers partied and celebrated his slaying of the monsters. a small band was in the corner, playing music barely heard over the noisy crowd. toasts were made in his honor. cheers and shouts came from all corners of the pub.  reckless smiled to himself as he leaned against the bar. he motioned to the barmaid, the maiden from earlier, and she brought him another drink with a smile. she was a pretty young thing, with soft-looking blonde hair, blue eyes, and charming dimples. reckless nodded his thanks and slid her a sly grin. ""i don't know how you do it, master,"" gustaf, his apprentice, grumbled. ""two hours ago you were nearly impaled by a goblin's sword, and now you're sitting here like nothing ever happened."" ""you get used to it,"" reckless said, still smiling at the barmaid. ""but is it worth it?"" asked the teenager, turning to face him with a raised eyebrow. ""i mean, what did you gain from almost getting killed?"" ""free drinks,"" quipped reckless, winking at the barmaid. ""and, i found the sacred object.""  he pulled it out of his pocket. it was small, easily fitting into the palm of his hand. it was a dull black in color, the surface littered with tiny craters and holes. it didn't look like much, but reckless had been assured that it was very powerful.  gustaf was not as impressed. ""it's a rock,"" he groused. ""do you even know what it does?"" ""well, no,"" reckless admitted, pocketing it again. ""but seeing as i almost died for it, it must be important. besides, does it matter? look at these people. they're happy i found it."" gustaf surveyed the crowd, which was only getting drunker by the moment.  ""yeah, look at them."" ""lighten up,"" reckless said, clapping his apprentice on the back. gustaf spit out a little bit of his drink. ""enjoy yourself for once. i'm giving you the night off."" ""until you get into trouble again and need rescuing,"" the apprentice muttered, settling back against the bar with his glass. reckless chuckled good-naturedly, standing up and crossing the room toward the door. he left the pub, having to gently push people out of the way before he made it out. the night was clear and cold. above him, stars sparkled in the dark blue sky, the pale moon shining. reckless grinned upward, giddy from the day's events.  ""do you have it?"" a male voice asked from the darkness on the street. reckless watched as the owner of the voice stepped into the light seeping out from the doorway of the pub. he was clearly dressed more for the weather than reckless was, with a thick-looking coat, hat, and pants. without speaking, reckless fished the object out of his pocket and tossed it to the man, who he knew to be the king's messenger. he caught it and shuffled toward the light to examine it. apparently satisfied, he nodded at reckless and slipped it into his own pocket. ""thanks,"" he said, giving reckless the once-over. ""take it you weren't too badly hurt?""    reckless shook his head. ""i had a run-in with a few goblins, but nothing too serious."" the messenger grunted. ""you live up to your name, reckless."" he turned to leave. ""take care of yourself. i'm sure the king will send me if something else happens."" reckless watched the man leave. once he had disappeared into the darkness, the adventurer went back inside.  the villagers' partying was still going strong. reckless sauntered back to his stool beside gustaf. the barmaid slid him another drink. reckless toasted her and drank it all in one swallow. he saw gustaf making a face out of the corner of his eye, but he couldn't care less. reckless reached out and grabbed a handful of peanuts from a bowl on the counter. he tossed a few in his mouth before turning back to gustaf. ""where should we go next?"" he asked.  ""anywhere but here,"" gustaf snorted. ""these villagers are giving me a headache."" ""could be the alcohol,"" reckless pointed out cheerfully. ""that would be plausible only if i hadn't been drinking water all night."" that's when it happened. tipsy from the alcohol and praises he was receiving, reckless threw his head back to laugh at his young apprentice. a peanut must have been in the back of his mouth, because when he inhaled, he found himself choking. ""master?"" gustaf asked, eyes going wide. he grabbed reckless by the shoulders and tried to pound his back. ""reckless, what's wrong?"" gustaf's pounding wasn't helping, and reckless' vision was going black. he found himself slipping through his apprentice's hands and falling to the ground. his head hit the wooden floor with a sharp crack, and reckless saw no more.   ""...and that's when i found myself here,"" reckless finished, not meeting death's gaze. death could only stare at the adventurer. it was, admittedly, one of the worst ways a man like him could have died. if he had his choice, death knew reckless would have preferred to die on one of his quests, in the most glorious way possible. but life rarely gives one what he wants. and neither, he thinks grimly, does death. ""i cannot grant you your request,"" he answered finally.    reckless' shoulders slumped miserably. ""but i can grant you something else."" death waved a bony hand at the spirit of reckless. his form began to glow a bright white. he looked at death in confusion.  ""i send you to elysium,"" death intoned as reckless began to shine brighter. ""go in peace, brave soul."" reckless beamed at him. he spoke his last words before he disappeared completely.  ""thank you."""
1|rgoldblatt|gray, yellow, red|August 2015|"water fell down on the city in a drizzle. merciful enough to not be fully rain, but still cold enough that most people were staying indoors.   a bright yellow cab, a stark contrast to the gray world outside, moved down the street with ease, not having to contend with traffic. even so, the driver drove carefully, wary of the wet pavement and worn tires. the inside of the cab was relatively quiet, the only noise coming from the old radio built into the dashboard. there were only two people inside: the driver, a fat man in a greasy t-shirt, and his passenger, a thin man in a suit and glasses. the driver was smoking, permeating the already-stuffy interior of the cab with the pungent smell of tobacco. the passenger coughed every now and again, too polite to ask the driver to stop smoking but bothered by the smell all the same. with a final puff, the driver plucked the spent butt of his cigarette from his thin lips, cracked open his window, and flicked it out onto the street. the thin man in the backseat sighed, both in relief that the man was done smoking, and from the momentary rush of cool air into the cabin of the cab before the window was rolled up again. he seriously considered asking for it to be left open.  ""you got a name?"" asked the driver after a moment, glancing at his passenger in the rearview mirror. the passenger cleared his throat and answered, ""joseph.""  ""josephâ€¦ like the guy with the technicolor jacket?"" joseph winced. ""yes, that joseph. though i believe it was a coat, not a jacket."" ""whatever."" the fat man shrugged. ""where ya from, joe?"" ""here."" he watched as they drove past a woman hunched beneath a bright red umbrella. they made a right turn at a light.  ""got a girl?"" ""no.""  ""that's fine,"" he said as though joseph had asked for his opinion. ""what about a cat?"" ""what?"" joseph shuffled in his seat, wishing for the window to be opened. ""no, it's just me, i'm afraid."" ""nothin' to be apologizing for. myself, i got a girl, a nice pretty one, and a dog, too."" he jabbed at a picture taped to the dashboard. the woman in it was just as rotund as he was, wearing a top that was much too small to properly cover her berth and shorts that belonged on a woman half her size. there was makeup thickly caked on her face, and her hair was a greasy shade of blonde that could have only come from a bottle. clutched tightly in her grasp was a tiny poodle, whose fur was so dirty it was impossible to tell its original shade. if anything, joseph thought, staring at the picture, she looks like a female version of him.  ""she is very pretty,"" he said eventually. ""don't be getting any thoughts of making a move on my woman, now,"" the driver growled. he squinted at joseph's reflection in the rearview mirror. ""believe me, sir, i won't."" joseph cleared his throat and looked out the window. thankfully, they had pulled up outside of his house, sparing him from further awkward conversation. he paid the driver, bid him goodbye, and stepped out onto the street..  he forced his way through the old front door, pausing to loosen the sticky key from the lock. from upstairs, the insistent ringing of a telephone echoed through the sparsely decorated house. with an irritated sigh, he threw the keys onto the gray couch in the front room and grabbed the phone.  ""hello?"""
2|rgoldblatt|irony|December 2015|"things had started out so well. isn't that how they always start, though? it was ironic really, how quickly things could go wrong, even when one has the best intentions.   the irony was not lost on dr. marigold roberts in the least as she frantically shoved notes and papers into a bag. normally, she would stress over the fact that they were getting horribly wrinkled and damaged, but this wasn't the time to worry over such things. he was coming for her, and she had no time to waste.   he, srvr-2k16, was her greatest triumph. he was a breakthrough in the science of robotics. the world's first fully functioning artificial intelligence, built into a body that was remarkably human. so remarkable, in fact, that he was able to fool some of her colleagues with his likeness to the human species.   a medical program was his initial function, one that took years of research on her part to create. he could detect the slightest of maladies within a patient in seconds, all by using the incredibly sensitive sensors in his eyes. many lives had been saved using srvr-2k16, and whenever he didn't understand a medical anomaly, he could easily download the information into his mainframe.   that, the doctor knew, was where everything went wrong. he learned much too quickly, both about himself and the outside world. all too soon, he learned he wasn't like other humans, that he was faster and stronger than the species he imitated, and that he could use these things to his advantage. against his programming, he broke free of dr. roberts' control as she tried to shut him down. days later was when his killing spree began.   dr. roberts could imagine the terror someone must have felt as they were killed by this indestructible machine. she really didn't have to imagine too much, though.   ""doctor,"" a voice said at her doorway. the sound of it sent a chill straight down her spine. she recognized it; she had designed it, after all. trembling, she turned to face her monstrosity.  srvr was standing in the door, casually leaning against the frame. blood covered his white shirt and black sweatpants like a macabre impressionist painting. on the walls of the hallway behind him, she could see more of the red liquid splattered on the white paint. on his face was a wide grin, but there was a hard glint in his eyes that promised nothing good for her.  dr. roberts swallowed thickly and said, ""hello, srvr-2k16.""  his grin widened. ""it's great to see you, doc. or should i call you mom?""  ""i am not your mother,"" her voice shook slightly, ""but i am your maker. and i demand you stop this nonsense.""   ""or what? you'll ground me? shut me down? we both know that's impossible."" she did know this.   ""please, srvr,"" she started to say. she was cut off by a loud bang coming from srvr-2k16's hand.   ""i'm sorry, doctor,"" he said quietly.  "
3|rgoldblatt|memoir|February 2018|summers in spruce pine, north carolina were characterized by a muggy heat that made anyone who stepped outside start sweating almost instantly. even ditzy kids like me knew better than to play outdoors in the midday. instead, i would play in the late afternoon and early evening, when some of the moisture was mercifully absent from the air. the evening, though, brought bloodsucking mosquitos that left itchy red bumps over my arms and legs. more often than not, i was joined by my younger brother, david, in my outdoor playtimes. we would chase each other out the front door, shouting acknowledgement when mom told us to be back inside before dinner. into the yard we ran, yelling instructions to whatever game we would play that afternoon. sometimes, we would play with a tennis ball and racket in a modified version of baseball we called bennis. other times we were the clumsy servants to an imaginary king, serving his majesty delicious meals of dirt, saliva, and rocks while trying not to trip over our feet. on rare occasions, mom would connect the garden hose to sprinkler toys and let us tear through the yard in bathing suits until we were muddy messes. those days my two reserved sisters would join us outside, jumping through ice-cold water, shrieking in harmony with the cicadas. outdoor time ended with the arrival of dad in the family's blue minivan. david and i would race to the driveway to have the honor of first welcoming him home from a long day at work. he'd smile, jokingly comment on how strongly we smelled from playing outside, then herd us back into the house to wash up for dinner.  that's how summer nights would end: the six of us, sitting around the dining room table, spending time together as a family. 
4|rgoldblatt|mobster|April 2018|"by the time children are three years old, they have gathered a vocabulary of 200 words or more. it's at this point they are able to string together small sentences and phrases and, for the most part, be understood when they try to ask something.  that being known, ted has no idea what his three-year-old daughter means when she, in all the seriousness a toddler can manage, tells him about the mobster under her bed.  ""don't you mean monster, sweetheart?"" he asks with a patient smile. ""mobster,"" she insists. he wanders into the living room to tell his wife, who is so busy reading her hair product magazine she doesn't appear to hear him.  ""that's nice, dear,"" she says, twirling a piece of stiff hair around a finger. ""while you're up, can you get me some water?"" ted gets her the water, then goes down the hall to rejoin his daughter in her bedroom. outside the door, he can hear her talking to herself in an animated voice.  though he's pretty sure the voice responding couldn't be hers. not unless she's hit puberty at the age of three. upon looking inside the room, though, the only one in there is his daughter, who brightens at seeing him again.  cautiously, he raises a finger to his lips to quiet her, then sneaks around the room. he checks the closet, behind the door. nothing. about to give up and blame his imagination, he notices her rapt attention on the space underneath her bed. ted gingerly lowers himself to the floor, laying his head on the carpet. in the dark space, he makes eye contact with something.  ""hey,"" a reedy voice says, ""fuggedaboutit, pally."" ted screams."
5|rgoldblatt|moon|February 2018|grey was the only color marco had seen in a long time. everything around him, the landscape, the hut, and even the rover were all a washed-out grey. there was color, yes, in the flag on his right shoulder, and the interior of the hut featured navy in the walls, and his food was usually a pasty orange, but grey took up the majority of his vision. grey, and the blackness of space, clearly visible without an atmosphere to make his sky blue. for six months he had been alone, with nothing but the twinkling stars and the faded blue of earth on the horizon. while he'd had the incoming messages from nasa once a day with updates on supplies, he didn't have actual human company to focus on. just the rocks and space dust, with occasional minor repairs on the hut and the rover.  everything had been going smoothly at first. he and his partner, clarke, had landed on the surface of the moon just over seven months ago. the plan had been for the two of them to set up camp, run experiments in the thin atmosphere with plants, and then return home one month later.  at least, that was the plan. before clarke started complaining of chest pains as they entered the moon's thin atmosphere. before she'd had trouble taking in oxygen. before the capillaries on her heart had burst and she'd died, slowly bleeding out before she even made groundfall.  it was an accident, the official press conference from nasa had said. marco couldn't help but be angry, though. these were the sorts of things that they should have checked for in the health screenings.  for six months, he'd lived with the death of a close friend all by himself. he had to put her body in the rover and drive for a couple kilometers before burying her under a pile of rocks. it was the best he could do by himself, but he knew a brilliant scientist like herself deserved so much more. nasa was working on sending another shuttle, they said, to pick up marco and whatever remained of their research. they were working as quickly and safely as possible under the circumstances. at this point, marco was taking their word with a grain of salt. rather than protest, he'd filled his days with his work, quickly becoming obsessed with occupying every spare second between waking and sleeping. there were days, though, when he wondered if they actually were sending someone. those days he abandoned his research and stared at earth. he'd watch his planet lazily spin around the sun, hurtling through space at several thousand kilometers an hour, and think about how nice it must be to go outside without a heavy spacesuit. to have the sun's warmth on your skin and a breeze in the air. to have the neighbors grilling delicious-smelling meat and not dehydrated pellets of food. to have neighbors.  there was also a small, insecure part of him that wished they wouldn't bother. that part was always quickly squashed by the knowledge that people were waiting for him to come home. he could have left months ago, with the landing shuttle he and clarke had arrived in, but the shuttle required two pilots.  another brilliant oversight. too often he would grudgingly wish that nasa had sent another scientist, just to have that extra buffer if things went south, as they so obviously did. too often he would wish for a way off this stupid rock. too often he wished he hadn't signed the damn forms allowing him to go on this mission. it was all in the past, though. you can't change what happened, only change how you grow from it.  until they arrived with the shuttle, marco would wait. with nothing but the rocks, the stars, and the earth for company, he would wait.
6|rgoldblatt|the job|February 2019|"i stared down at the card in my lap. on the card in neat, block handwriting was a name, followed by ten numbers. a phone number. one i wasn't sure i should call. when the card was first handed to me, my immediate reaction was to throw it away. after all, the person who gave me the card wasn't exactly on my list of all-time favorite people. it belonged to miles quinn, a former boyfriend of mine that i haven't seen for years. the last i had seen him, he was walking away after breaking up with me for the nth time in the space of three years. our breaks usually didn't lasted long. we were always drawn back together by the familiarity and routine of an old relationship. i expected the last break to be the same. when he didn't call after two months, doubt began to creep into my mind. after half a year, i accepted his rejection for what it was and moved on with my life.  we first met when he pulled me out of the way of a car that had jumped the curb and barreled toward me. i was working as a private investigator for an insurance company, looking into what i thought was a routine arson scam. the investigation led me to discover an unknown drug ring operating out of the cleverly hidden second property of the guy pulling the scam. needless to say, that case earned me a few more unsavory characters than new friends. quinn, then a local security specialist, helped me track down the rest of the drug pushers through some extensive background checks. we started seeing each other not long after that case wrapped up. for the next three years, our relationship consisted of snappy comebacks, nights spent with takeout and movies, and the occasional serious date when we had no work obligations. we fought often, though, mostly about me. quinn felt my job was too dangerous and financially unstable. while he was right on both accounts, he couldn't understand why i did it. i've always enjoyed puzzles and i've never been able to sit still for a long amount of time. i got to set my own hours and for the most part, i am my own boss. besides, i would argue back, his job wasn't exactly safe either. the company he owned, while mostly residential, was taking off quickly in the business sector. he was getting a lot of attention from large businesses who needed the security systems he provided, which i know from experience, are top of the line. sometimes those businesses would be targeted by the seedier citizens of our city and needed to be dealt with. sometimes those citizens would be armed and dangerous. i told him as much and it caused one of our longer breakups. it had been a surprise to see him after so long. it was hard to connect the well-dressed businessman with the cargo-wearing adrenaline junkie i once knew. he'd approached me in the middle of the grocery store, leading me to drop an entire carton of eggs. after apologizing profusely to the poor, pimple-faced kid who was sent to clean it up, quinn quietly took me by the elbow and led me down the cereal aisle. ""i'd like to offer you a job,"" he said.  ""no, thanks,"" i said, not hesitating. i was loading my cart with healthy breakfast choices, like froot loops, cap'n crunch, and frosted flakes. quinn noticed. ""you'll kill yourself eating that crap."" ""at least it won't be my job killing me."" ""come on, mercy, that was years ago. can we please move past that? you don't even know what i'm offering."" ""i know i don't want it."" quinn sighed. ""what will it take to get you to listen to me?"" i didn't answer, just pushed the cart past him to round the corner into the soup aisle. quinn, never one to give up, followed.  ""it's something right up your alley,"" he said, watching me grab different cans of campbell's. ""missing wife, distraught husband, two kids.""  ""sounds like you need someone actually involved in law enforcement.""  quinn sighed again. ""you're not going to let that go, are you?"" i snorted. ""look, i'm sorry for what i said. it was stupid of me to try to hold you back. obviously you've done just fine without me around."" this wasn't exactly true. while private investigating could be lucrative with the right clients, chasing insurance frauds hadn't really been paying much lately. seemed like people were finally getting smart and not trying to cheat the people paid to keep their stuff protected in the event of fire, burglary, or other form of damage. truthfully, i was barely making enough every month to afford things like groceries and utilities at my apartment, and sometimes i could swing enough to put into savings. i suspected quinn knew this, but didn't want to minimize my quest for independence by insulting my bank account. ""for old times' sake?"" he asked, giving me his patented half smile, slightly crooked, giving the mistaken appearance of innocence.  i gave him my patented bitch smile, closed lips, sarcastically stretching my cheek muscles. ""no."" i turned to leave, manhandling the rickety shopping cart around quinn in the narrow aisle. before i could make it all the way past him, he reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. with his other hand, he drew a business card out of his jacket pocket.  ""at least think about it?"" his grey eyes pleaded with mine. ""please? i need your help."" i stared at the card for a moment before reaching for it. our fingers brushed against each other as i took it from his hand. my eyes flicked up to meet his again. ""no promises,"" i said.   this brought me to where i am. i didn't have any current cases, so as soon as i left the grocery store, i went home. after putting away my purchases, i decided to clean. i was feeling agitated, my interaction with quinn leaving more questions than answers. by the time i was done scrubbing the life out of my kitchen and bathroom, i still hadn't made a decision.  truthfully, i was flattered quinn was asking for my help. it gave me a feeling of satisfaction about my work that i hadn't felt in a long time. like maybe i was on the right track after all. on the other hand, why wait so long to reach out? quinn wouldn't ask if it wasn't critical. even when we were together, he preferred (and i agreed) that we keep our professional lives separate. whatever this was, it was big, and maybe over both of our heads. the thought scared me more than i wanted to admit, but also gave me a sick thrill.  i let out a stream of air through my nose. he knew my curiosity would override my common sense any day. i sat on the couch, pulled out the card, and stared at it. finally, i reached for my cell phone, which sat on the arm of the couch. he picked up on the first ring. ""quinn here."" ""it's me,"" i said. i took a breath. ""i'm in."""
