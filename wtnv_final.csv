WTNV|Pilot|15 June 2012|a friendly desert community where the sun is hot , the moon is beautiful , and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep . welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . to start things off , i ' ve been asked to read this brief notice : the city council announces the opening of a new dog park at the corner of earl and somerset , near the ralph 's . they would like to remind everyone that dogs are not allowed in the dog park . people are not allowed in the dog park . it is possible you will see hooded figures in the dog park . do not approach them . do not approach the dog park . the fence is electrified and highly dangerous . try not to look at the dog park , and especially do not look for any period of time at the hooded figures . the dog park will not harm you . and now , the news . old woman josie , out near the car lot , says the angels revealed themselves to her . said they were ten feet tall , radiant , and one of them was black . said they helped her with various household ch ores . one of them changed a light bulb for her – the porch light . she 's offering to sell the old light bulb , which has been touched by an angel . it was the black angel , if that sweetens the pot for anyone . if you ' re interested , contact old woman josie . she 's out near the car lot . a new man came into town today . who is he ? what does he want from us ? why his perfect and beautiful hair cut ? why his perfect and beautiful coat ? he says he is a scientist . well ... we have all been scientists at one point or another in our lives . but why now ? why here ? and just what does he plan to do with all those breakers and humming electrical instruments in that lab he 's renting – the one next to big rico 's pizza ? no one does a slice like big rico . no one . just a reminder to all the parents out there : let 's talk about safety when taking your children out to play in the scrublands and the sand wastes . you need to give them plenty of water , make sure there 's a shade tree in the area , and keep an eye on the helicopter colors . are the unmarred helicopter curling the area black ? probably world government . not a good area for play that day . are they blue ? that 's the sheriff 's secret police . they ' ll keep a good eye on your kid s , and hardly ever take one . are they painted with complex morals depicting birds of prey diving ? no one knows what those helicopter are , or what they want . do not play in the area . return to your home and lock the doors until a sheriff 's secret policeman leaves a car nation on your porch to indicate that the danger has passed . cover your ears to blot out the screams . also remember : gatorade is basically soda , so give your kid s plain old water and maybe some orange slices when they play . a commercial airline flying through local air space disappeared today , only to reappear in the night vale elementary gymnasium during basketball practice , disrupting practice quite badly . the jet roared through the small gym for only a fraction of a second . and before it could strike any players or structure , it vanished again . this time , apparently , for good . there is no word yet on if or how this will affect night vale mountain lions ' game schedule , and also if this could perhaps be the work of their bitter rivals the desert bluff cacti . desert bluff is always trying to show us up through fancier uniforms , better pre-game snacks , and possibly by transporting a commercial jet into our gymnasium , delaying practice for several minutes at least . for shame , desert bluff . for shame . that new scientist – we now know it 's named carlos – called a town meeting . he has a square jaw , and teeth like a military cemetery . his hair is perfect , and we all hate , and despair , and love that perfect hair in equal measure . old woman josie brought corn puffing which were decent , but lacked salt . she said the angels had taken her salt for a godly mission , and she had not yet gotten around to buying more . carlos told us that we are by far the most scientifically interesting community in the u.s. , and he had come to study just what is going on around here . he grinned , and everything about him was perfect , and i fell in love instantly . government agents from a vague yet menacing agency were in the back , watching . i fear for carlos . i fear for night vale . i fear for anyone caught between what they know and what they do not yet know that they do not know . we received a press release this morning . the night vale business association is proud to announce the opening of the brand new night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area . i have been to these facilities myself recently on their invitation , and i can tell you that it is absolutely top of the line and beautiful . sturdy dock ing areas made from eco-friendly post-consumer material , a boardwalk for pedestrians , and plenty of stands ready for local food vendor and merchants to turn into a bustling public marketplace . now , there is some concern about the fact that , given we are in the middle of a desert , there is no actual water at the waterfront . and that is a definite drawback , i agree . for instance , the boardwalk is currently overlooking sagebrush and rocks . the business association did not provide any specific remedies for this problem , but they assured me that the new harbor would be a big boost to night vale nonetheless . maybe wait until a flash flood and head down there for the full waterfront experience . the local chapter of the n ra is selling bump er stickers as part of their fundraising week . they sent the station one to get some publicity . and we ' re here to serve the community , so i 'm happy to let you all know about it . the stickers are made from good , sturdy vinyl , and they read : guns do not kill people . it 's impossible to be killed by a gun . we are all invincible to bullets and it 's a miracle . stand outside of your front door and shout `` n ra ! '' to order one . carlos and his team of scientists warn that one of the houses in the new development of desert creek , out back of the elementary school , does not actually exist . `` it seems like it exists , '' explained carlos and his perfect hair . `` like it 's just right there when you look at it . and it 's between two other identical houses , so it would make more sense for it to be there than not . '' but , he says , they have done experiments and the house is definitely not there . at news time , the scientists are standing in a group on the sidewalk in front of the nonexistent house , daring each other to go knock on the door . a great howling was heard from the night vale post office yesterday . postal workers claim no knowledge , although passers-by describe the sound as being a little like a human soul being destroyed through black magic . the indian track er – now , i do not know if you ' ve seen this guy around . he 's the one that appears to be of maybe slavic origin , yet wears an indian headdress out of some racism cartoon and claims to be able to read tracks on shalt . he appeared on the scene , and swore that he would discover the truth . no one responded because it 's really hard to take him seriously in that headdress of his . lights . seen in the sky above the arby 's . not the glowing sign of arby 's . something higher , and beyond that . we know the difference . we ' ve caught on to their game . we understand the `` lights above arby 's '' game . invaders from another world . ladies and gentlemen , the future is here , and it 's about 100 feet above the arby 's . carlos and his scientists at the monitoring station near route 800 say their seismic monitor have been indicating wild seismic shifts – meaning to say that the ground should be going up and down all over the place . i do not know about you folks , but the ground has been as still as the crust of a tiny globe docketing through an endless void could be . carlos says that they ' ve double-checked the monitor and they are in perfect working order . to put it plainly , there appears to be catastrophe earthquakes happening right here in night vale that absolutely no one can feel . well , submit an insurance claim anyway . see what you can get , right ? traffic time , listeners . now , police are issuing warnings about ghost cars out on the highways , those cars only visible in the distance reaching unimaginable speeds leaving destination unknown for destination more unknown . they would like to remind you that you should not set your speed by these apparition , and doing so will not be considered `` following the flow of traffic . '' however , they do say that it 's probably safe to match speed with the mysterious lights in the sky , as whatever entities or organizations responsible appear to be cautious and reasonable drivers . and now , the weather . welcome back , listeners . the sun did not set at the correct time today , carlos and his team of scientists report . they ' re quite certain about it . they checked multiple clocks and the sun definitely set ten minutes later than it was supposed to . i asked them if they had any explanations but they did not offer anything concrete . mostly they sat in a circle around a desk clock , staring at it , murdering , and cooing . still , we must be grateful to have the sun at all . it 's easy to forget in this hot , hot , hot desert climate , but things would actually be slightly harder for us without the sun . the next time the sun rises , whatever time that turns out to be , take a moment to feel grateful for all the warmth and light and even , yes , extreme heat that our desert community is gifted with . the city council would like to remind you about the tired heavens , and the hierarchy of angels . the reminder is that you should not know anything about this . the structure of heaven and the organizational chart are privileged information , known only to the city council members on a need-to-know basis . please do not speak to or acknowledge any angels that you may come across while shopping at the ralph 's or at the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex . they only tell lies and do not exist . report all angel sightings to the city council for treatment . and now a brief public service announcement . alligators : can they kill your children ? yes . along those lines , to get personal for a moment , i think the best way to die would be swallowed by a giant snake . going feet-first and whole into a slim ma w would give your life perfect symmetry . speaking of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , its owner , teddy williams , reports that he has found the entrance to a vast underground city in the pin retrieval area of lane 5. he said he has not yet ventured into it ; merely peered down at its strange spires and broad avenues . he also reports voices of a distant crowd in the depths of that subterranean metropolis . apparently the entrance was discovered when a bowl ing ball accidentally rolled into it , clattering down to the city below with sounds that echoed for miles across the impossible huge cavern . so , you know , whatever population that city has , they know about us now , and we might be hearing from them very soon . carlos , perfect and beautiful , came into our studies during the break earlier but declined to stay for an interview . he had some sort of blinking box in his hand covered with wires and tubes . said he was testing the place for `` materials . '' i do not know what materials he meant but that box sure whistled and peeped a lot . when he put it close to the microphone it sounded like , well , like a bunch of baby birds had just wo ken up . really went crazy . carlos looked nervous . i ' ve never seen that kind of look on someone with that strong of a jaw . he left in a hurry . told us to evacuate the building . but then , who would be here to talk to sweetly to all of you out there ? settling in to be another clear night and pretty evening here in night vale . i hope all of you out there have someone to sleep through it with . or , at least , good memories of when you did . goodnight , listeners . goodnight . today 's proverb : look to the north . keep looking . there 's nothing coming from the south .
WTNV|Glow Cloud|1 July 2012|the desert seems vast , even endless , and yet scientists tell us that somewhere , even now , there is snow . welcome to night vale . the night vale tourism board 's `` visit-able night vale '' campaign has kicked off with posters encouraging folks to take their family on a scenery-filled aunt through the trails of ra don canyon . their slogan ? `` the view is literally breathtaking . '' posters will be placed at police stations and frozen your shops in nearby towns , along with promotion al giveaways of plastic sheet ing and re-breathers . and now , the news . have any of our listeners seen the glowing cloud that has been moving in from the west ? well , john peters – you know , the farmer ? he saw it over the western ridge this morning . said he would have thought it was the setting sun if it was not for the time of day . apparently the cloud glows in a variety of colors , perhaps changing from observer to observer , although all report a low whistling when it draws near . one death has already been attributed to the glow cloud . but listen , it 's probably nothing . if we had to shut down the town for every mysterious event that at least one death could be attributed to , we d never have time to do anything , right ? that 's what the sheriff 's secret police are saying , and i agree . although , i would not go so far as to endorse their suggestion to run directly at the cloud , shrieking and waving your arms , just to see what it does . the apache track er , and i remind you that this is that white guy who wears the huge and cartoonishly inaccurate indian headdress , has announced that he has found some disturbing evidence concerning the recent incident at the night vale post office , which has been sealed by the city council since the great screaming that was heard from it a few weeks ago . he said that using ancient indian magic , he slipped through council security into the post office , and observed that all the letters and packages had been thrown about as in a whirlwind . that there was the heavy stench of scorched flesh . that the words written in blood on the wall said , `` more to come , and soon . '' can you believe this guy said he used indian magic ? what an ashore ! here 's something odd : there is a cat covering in the men 's bathroom at the radio station here . he seems perfectly happy and healthy , but it 's floating about four feet off the ground next to the sink . does not seem to be able to move from its current hover-spot . if you pet him , he puris , and he ' ll rub on your body like a normal cat if you get close enough . fortunately , because he 's right by the sink , it was pretty easy to leave some water and food where he could get it , and it 's nice to have a station pet . wish it was not trapped in a covering prison in the men 's bathroom , but listen : no pet is perfect . it becomes perfect when you learn to accept it for what it is . and now a message from our sponsors . i took a walk on the cool sand dun es , brittle grass overgrown , and above me in the night sky above me i saw . bitter taste of unripe peaches and a smell i could not place nor could i escape . i remembered other times that i could not escape . i remembered other smells . the moon sunk like a wounded animal . the world spun like it had lost control . concentrate only on breathing , and let go of ideas you had about nutrition and alarm clocks . i took a walk on the cool sand dun es , brittle grass overgrown , and above me in the night sky above me i saw . this message was brought to you by co ca co la . the city council , in cooperation with government agents from a vague yet menacing agency , is asking all citizens to stop by the night vale elementary school gymnasium tonight at 7:00 for a brief questionnaire about mysterious sights that definitely no one saw and strange thoughts that in no way occurred to anyone . because all of us are normal , and to be otherwise would make us outcast from our own community . remember : if you see something , say nothing . and drink to forget . the boy scouts of night vale have announced some slight changes to their hierarchy , which will now be the following : cub scout , boy scout , eagle scout , blood p act scout , weird scout , dreadnought scout , dark scout , fear scout , and finally , eternal scout . as always , sign-up is automatic and random , so please keep an eye out for the scarlet envelope that will let you know your son has been chosen for the process . this is probably nothing listeners , but john peters – you know , the farmer – he reports that the glow cloud is directly over old town night vale , and appears to be raining small creatures upon the earth . armadillos , wizards , a few crows , that kind of thing . fortunately , the animals appear to be dead already , so the night vale animal control department has said that it should be a snap to clean those up . they just have to be tossed on the eternal animal pyre in mission grove park , so , if that 's the worst the glow cloud has for us , i say go ahead and do your daily errands . just bring along a good strong umbrella capable of handling falling animals up to , say , ten pounds . more on the glow cloud as it continues to crawl across our sky . and hey , here 's a tip , take your kid s out and use the cloud 's constantly mutating hue to teach him or her the names of colors . it 's fun , and it shows them the real-life applications of learning . alert : the sheriff 's secret police are searching for a fugitive named hiram mcdaniels , who escaped custody last night following a 9:00 pm arrest . mcdaniels is described as a five-headed dragon , approximately 18 feet tall , with mostly green eyes , and weighing about 3600 pounds . he is suspected of insurance fraud . mcdaniels was pulled over for speeding last night , and the secret police became suspicious when he allegedly gave the officers a fake driver 's license for a five foot eight man named frank chen . after discerning that frank chen was actually a five-headed dragon from somewhere other than our little world , the secret police searched mcdaniels ' vehicle . representatives from local civil rights organizations have protested that officers had no legal grounds to search the vehicle , but they ceded the point when reminded by secret police officials that our backwards court system will uphold any old authoritarian rule made up on the fly by supervised gun-carrying thus of a shadow government . the secret police say mcdaniels escaped custody by breathing fire from his purple head , and he was last seen flying and shrieking over red me sa . secret police are asking for tips leading to the arrest of hiram mcdaniels . they remind you that , if seen , he should not be approached , as he is literally a five headed dragon . contact the sheriff 's secret police if you have any information . ask for officer ben . helpful sisters will earn one stamp on their alert citizen card . collect five stamps , and you get stop sign immunity for one year . and now , a look at the community calendar . saturday , the public library will be unknowable . citizens will forget the existence of the library from 6:00 am saturday morning until 11:00 pm that night . the library will be under a sort of renovation . it is not important what kind of renovation . sunday is dot day . remember , red dots on what you love , blue dots on what you do not . mixing those up can cause permanent consequences . monday , louie black is offering bluegrass lessons in the back of louie 's music shop . of course , the shop burned down years ago , and louie skipped town immediately after with his insurance money , but he 's sent word that you should bring your instrument to the crumbled ashy shell of where his shop once was , and pretend that he is there in the darkness teaching you . the price is $ 50 per lesson , payable in advance . tuesday afternoon , join the night vale pta for a bake sale to support citizens for a blood space war . proceeds will go to support neuron bomb development and employment to our outer solar system allies . wednesday has been canceled due to a schelling error . and on thursday is a free concert . and ... that 's all it says here . new call in from john peters – you know , the farmer ? seems the glow cloud has doubled in size , enveloping all of night vale in its weird light and humming song . little league administration has announced that they will be going ahead with the game , although there will be an awning built over the field due to the increase in size of the animal corpses being dropped . i ' ve had multiple reports that a lion , like the kind you would see on the sun-baked plains of africa , or a pee-stained enclosure at a local z oo , fell on top of the white sand ice cream shop . the shop is offering a free dipped cone to anyone who can figure out how to get the thing off . the sheriff 's secret police have apparently taken to shouting questions at the glow cloud , trying to ascertain what exactly it wants . so far , the glow cloud has not answered . the glow cloud does not need to converse with us . it does not feel as we tiny humans feel . it has no need for thoughts or feelings of love . the glow cloud simply is . all hail the mighty glow cloud ! all hail ! and now , slaves of the cloud , the weather . sorry , listeners . not sure what happened in that earlier section of the broadcast – as in i actually do not remember what happened . tried to play back the tapes , but they ' re all blank , and smell faintly of vanilla . the glow cloud , meanwhile , has moved on . it is now just a glowing spot in the distance , humming east to destination unknown . we may never fully understand , or understand at all what it was and why it dumped a lot of dead animals on our community . but , and i 'm going to get a little personal here , that 's the essence of life , is not it ? sometimes you go through things that seem huge at the time , like a mysterious glowing cloud devouring your entire community . while they ' re happening they feel like the only thing that matters , and you can hardly imagine that there 's a world out there that might have anything else going on . and then the glow cloud moves on . and you move on . and the event is behind you . and you may find that , as time passes , you remember it less and less . or absolutely not at all , in my case . and you are left with nothing but a powerful wonder at the fleeting nature of even the most important things in life – and the faint but pretty smell of vanilla . dear listeners , here is a list of things . emotions you do not understand upon viewing a sunset lost pets , found lost pets , un found a secret lost pet city on the moon trees that see restaurant that hear a void that thinks a face half-seen just before falling asleep trembling hands reaching for desperately needed items sandwiched silence when there should be noise noise when there should be silence nothing when you want something something when you thought there was nothing clear plastic binder sheets scented dwyer sheets rain coming down in sheets night rest sleep end goodnight , listeners . goodnight . today 's proverb : men are from mars ; women are from venus ; earth is a hallucinations ; podcasts are dreams .
WTNV|Station Management|15 July 2012|the arctic is lit by the midnight sun . the surface of the moon is lit by the face of the earth . our little town is lit , too , by lights just above that we can not explain . welcome to night vale . the night vale daily journal has announced that they will be cutting back their publication schedule to monday through thursday only , due to the economic downturn and a massive decline in the literate population . the thursday daily journal will now be called the weekend edition , and on sundays , newspaper kiosks – usually filled with important newsprint – will be filled with 2 % milk . when asked `` why milk ? , '' the journal 's publishing editor leann heart said , `` it is important that we maintain an unbiased approach to news reporting . '' the night vale business association is proud to announce the new night vale stadium , next to the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area . the stadium will be able to seat 50,000 but will be closed all nights of the year except november 10 th , for the annual parade of the mysterious hooded figures , in which all of our favorite ominous hooded figures – the one that turks under the slide in the night vale elementary playground , the ones that meet regularly in the dog park , and the one that will occasionally openly steal babies ( and for a reason no one can understand , we all stand by and let him do it ) – all of them will be parading proudly through night vale stadium . i tell you , with these new facilities , it promises to be quite a spectacle . and then it promises to be a vast , dark , and echo-y space for the other meaningless 364 days of the year . here at the radio station it 's contract negotiation season with the station management again ! that 's always an interesting time . now , obviously , i 'm not allowed to go into details , but negotiation is tricky when you ' re never allowed to glimpse what you ' re negotiating with . station management stays inside their office at all times , only communicating with us through sealed envelopes that are spat out from under the door like a sunflower shell through teeth . then , in order to respond , you just kind of shout at the closed door and hope that management hears . sometimes you can see movements through the frosted glass , large shapes shifting around , strange tendrils whipping through the air . architectural speaking , the apparent size of management 's office does not physically make sense given the size of the building , but it 's hard to say , really , as no one has ever seen the actual office – only its translucent . look , i ' ve probably said too much . i can see down the hall that an envelope just came flying out . i pray it 's not another hr re training session in the dark box . u ugh ! but what can i say ? i 'm a reporter at heart . i ca not not report . oh , my ... let 's go to the seven-day outlook . your daily shades of the sky forecast : monday : turquoise tuesday : tape wednesday : robin 's egg thursday : turquoise/taupe friday : coal dust saturday : coal dust with chances of indigo in the late afternoon sunday : void the city council has asked me to remind everyone about the new drive to clean up litter . night vale is our home . and who wants to leave trash all over their home ? put it in the garage can , listeners ! and if you see any trash around , pick it up and throw it away . do your part . unless the trash is marked with a small red flag . the council has asked me to remind you that any litter marked with a red flag is not to be picked up or approached . remember the slogan : `` no flag ? goes in the bag . red flag ? run ! '' listeners , we are currently field ing numerous reports that books have stopped working . it seems that all over night vale , books have simply ceased function ing . the scientists are studying one of the broken books to see if they can understand just what is going on here . the exact problem is currently unclear , but some of the words being used include `` sparks , '' `` meat smell , '' `` biting , '' and `` lethal gas . '' for your own safety , please do not attempt to open a book until we have more information on the nature and cause of these problems . the city council has released only a brief statement indicating that their stance on books has not changed and that , as always , they believe that books are dangerous and inadvisable and should not be kept in private homes . another warning for night vale residents : sources say that the used and discount sporting goods store on flint drive is a front for the world government . this is based on extensive study of the location , and also because it has a black helicopter pad on which black helicopter regularly depart and land . fairly unusual for a used and discount sporting goods store . we sent our inter , chad , to try buying a tennis rack et – and have not heard back from him for several weeks . this brings me to a related point : to the parents of chad the inter : we regret to inform you that your son was lost in the line of community radio duty , and that he will be missed and never forgotten . may you all feel blessed to have the family that you have , and if you ' re looking for sporting goods , check out play ball right over by our own night vale community radio station ! play ball is only a front for the sheriff 's secret police , and so can be completely trusted . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , reported that a creeping fear came into night vale today . he felt it first as a mild apprehension , then a growing worry , and finally a mortal panic . it passed from him to the employees at the car lot , who crouched behind their cars and cast fearful eyes at the empty sky . it did not affect old woman josie , presumably because of her angelic protection , but it went from there to the rest of the town until we all were shivering in anticipation for a terrible thing we could not yet see . i myself was frozen , sure that any movement would lead to death ; that any word would be my last . of course , that also could have been the contracts negotiations with station management , and the hideous envelope i just received . also , i 'm rattling ly me disease . meanwhile , the creeping fear passed , first leaving larry le roy out on the edge of town , and then the car lot , where they went back to offering gently used cars at unfordable prices , and finally the rest of us – who could go back to living with the knowledge that at any given moment we will either live or die , and it 's no use guessing which . it is not currently known where the creeping fear will go next – hopefully to desert bluff . it would serve them right . two hawk-eyed listeners sent in reports that carlos , our curious scientific visitor , was seen getting his beautiful , beautiful hair cut . he was having his gorgeous hair shorn ! cut ! cut short ! so very short from his perfectly-shaped brilliant head ! listeners , i am not one to gossip even if it is a local celebrity , but please explain to me why carlos would strip away – delicate ! – any part of his thick black hair ... not to ignore the dignified , if premature , touch of gray in the temples . what treacherous barber should agree to such depwavity ? who takes mere money , or even soulless joy , in depriving our small community of such a simple , but important , act as lurid admiring carlos 's stunning co if ? reports from two intrepid sources are that it was telly the barber . telly , who likes sports and has posters of combs . telly the barber seems to be the one who betrayed our community . telly the barber . it is telly the barber at the corner of southwest th street and old must road , with the red and white spinning pole and the sign that says , `` telly 's . '' telly is about 5 ' 9 '' with a small mustache and a thick pot belly . he talks with an accent and sneer . telly the barber cut carlos 's beautiful hair . according to reports . telly . now , while i gather myself , let 's have a look at traffic . oh , wo w ! well , that looks pretty good . y up . messrs . okay , not too bad there either i see . oh ! that gentleman needs to slow it down ! it is not a race my friend ! not a literal one , anyway . that has been traffic . and now for an editorial . i do not ask favors much , dear listeners , that you know . but i 'm asking all of you now to conduct a letter-writing campaign to station management , which was not ... pleased with my discussion of their physical attributes and behavior and is now threatening to shut down my show – or possibly my life – for good . there wording was ... kind of ambiguous . obviously we will not be able to deliver the letters directly to the management , per se , as no one has ever opened their door ; but we can shout the content of the letters outside their office and we presume , given an anatomy that includes ears , they will be able to hear what you have to say . so if you like this show , and you want to hear more of it , then we need to hear from you . make your voice heard to whatever it is that lies in wait behind that darkened office door . oh ! i 'm sorry dear listeners . we ' ll be back after this word from our sponsors . this segment has been brought to us by big rico 's pizza . listeners , we are proud to have big rico 's as a sponsor of our show . you will not find a better pizza joint in all of night vale then big rico 's . just the other night , i stopped by big rico 's . i was in the mood for a delicious pizza slice . and since big rico 's is the only pizza place in night vale that has not burnt to the ground in an unsolved arson case ( and did i mention is also the best pizza in town ) , i ordered a single rico 's slice with two authentic toppings . and boy , was i satisfied . the flavor was scrumptious . the taste was also scrumptious . and it was warm , the pizza slice . i have been told that even the hooded figures eat there ; the wait staff look like they avert their hollow gazes quite a bit . even the city council offers its ringing endorsement of big rico 's . all night vale citizens are mandate to eat at big rico 's once a week . it is a misdemeanors not to . big rico 's pizza . no one does a slice like big rico , folks ! no one . and now , sweet , sweet listeners ... the weather . hello , radio audience . i come to you live from under my desk , where i dragged my microphone and am currently hiding in the fetal position . did you write letters ? then you should not do this anymore . station management has opened its door for the first time in my memory , and is now roaming the building . i do not know exactly what management looks like , as that is when i took cover under my desk and i can only hope that they are not listening to what 's going out right now or else i may have sealed my fate . i can hear only a kind of click ing footstep , and faint hissing sound like – releasing steam . an inter went to see what management wanted and has not returned . if you are related to jerry hart man , afternoon board operator at night vale community radio , i am sorry to inform you that he is probably dead or at least corporeally absorbed into management permanently ! jerry and chad the interns will both be missed , but we will surely see them in the thanksgiving day dead citizens impersonation contest , which this year will be in the employee lounge under the night vale mall from 11:00 am to 9:45 pm . there will be a cash bar and two twist er boards . i am going to see if i can make a break for the door . if you do not hear from me again , it has truly been a pleasure . good night , night vale . and goodby ! today 's p roverb : there 's a special place in hell . it 's really hip . very exclusive .
WTNV|PTA Meeting|1 August 2012|the sun has grown so very , very old . how long cold , fading death ? how long ? welcome to night vale . our top story : last night 's night vale pta meeting ended in bloodshed as a rift in space-time split open in the main street recreation center auditoriums , setting loose several confused and physically aggressive pteranodons . the glowing portal remained open and shrieked incessantly , an un holy sound that witnesses say resembled noisy urchin children caught in a combine harvest er , and then slowed down and camped up through some kind of open source , easy-to-use audit editing software . the pteranodons mostly attacked women with glasses . authorities are still un sure why , as night vale 's only flying dinosaur expert , joel eisenberg , still has not recovered from last year 's bout with throat spiders . it took most of an hour to coral the panicked beasts back into the vortex and resume the meeting , which had mostly been upon recent lunchroom price hikes , and had devolved into name calling because susan tillman called diane clayton 's son josh `` a bit stubby , '' and that `` maybe he needs a financial incentive to eat less . '' in this reporter 's opinion , susan tillman is dangerously obsessed with the new york times best-selling freakonomics books . dangerously so . fortunately , no one was injured or killed in the incident , although experts from timothy 's auditoriums repair contractors inch estimates close to $ 750,000 in damage has been done to the rec center auditoriums . and that cost includes free storm windows and a complementary seasonal installation consultation . it 's election season again , and you know what that means ! sheriff 's secret police will be coming by to collect certain family members so that everyone votes for the correct council seats and there 's no confusion . these family members will be held in a secure and disclosed location , which everyone knows is the abandoned mine shaft outside of town . but , do not let the name fool you , listeners : it 's been used for years for so many kidnapping and illegal detention that the abandoned mine shaft outside of town is actually a pretty nice location these days , featuring king-sized beds , free wife , and ho . also torture cubic les , but i do not think anyone 's going to make the council use those . remember , this is america . vote correctly , or never see your loved ones again . this message brought to you by the city council . the night vale daily journal today announced that due to the recent economic downturn , they will start running ad s on the front page . any business interested in running one of these platinum premium ad s should contact editor leann hart . hart mentioned that they have also created a `` write your own news story '' program for interested citizens . because every writer has been laid off , the daily journal now needs these community contributions to supply night vale with important news and features . the first platinum premium ad runs next monday and features the terrified face of an infant private with a superimposed spoon that has been stone-sharpened to a rough point , and the tag line `` better use tide . '' hart also said that last year 's explosion that decimated the daily journal 's distribution plant is still totally an accident , and would like her insurance rep to call her back . please . call her back . this just came across the wire : the secret police have issued a new statement shedding more light onto last night 's pta meeting incident . the noisy portal and subsequent dinosaur attack that brutally interrupted discussion of swing set repairs on the elementary school playground stayed open long after recreation center employees thought they had rounded up all of the ancestral again beasts , and authorities warn that there is still at least one more pteranodon on the loose . citizens should cover themselves with a low-spf sun screen and hide in a tiled bathroom . several curious handbills players in the court next to the auditoriums actually popped their heads into the portal – just to see what was on the other side of the vortex – and came back dramatically changed . the players aged several thousand years in what bystanders experienced as only a few seconds . those handbills players now saddle the unenviable border of millennially widened and crippling insane . since psychological and emotional damages are no longer considered valid claims by the greater medical insurance community , we are still reporting zero injuries . we ' ll update you as further details surface in our special on going and very special coverage of pteranodon attack-gate . are we safe from dinosaurs ? no way . city council has asked me to read the following message : if you notice strange au ras around any of the following objects in your house : blend er , shower head , dog , husband , wife , table , chair , doorknob , dashboard , vacation souvenir or photo , collectibles of any kind ( especially those depicting or involving horses ) , dvds ( especially cliffhanger , there 's something about mary , and the wire th season ) , and any bagged lecture from california or mexico , please , report to the council for indefinite detention . speaking of the city council , it voted this week to remove the large lead-plated door from the northeastern-most crook of ra don canyon – you know , the area pulling with green light and sot to vo ce bass humming . opponents of the measure called the large yellow emblem and red letter ing that spelled out : ... were , at worst , an offensive eye sore and , at best , a hack sci-fi cliche . many night vale citizens attended the meeting including , it was said , several angels – although no angel is admitted to have been present for the city council meeting ... or any other event ever , for that matter . old woman josie agreed with the measure , adding that lead is a health hazard , and that the old door was nothing but a ticking time bomb . according to the meeting minutes , josie said , `` that old door . oooh , that door ! someone 's go n na get some kind of lead poisoning ! '' carlos , beautiful carlos , tragically shorn of his locks , reportedly was the only dissenting voice . but it is not clear he actually opposed the measure , as the minutes only report him stating , `` there is no time . no more time , '' into a black entangle in his hand , and then running , wind ed , from the community hall . according to old woman josie , he was still absolutely perfect , and smelled of lavender chewing gum . more breaking news on the pteranodons . we humbly offer the following retraction from our previous reports : secret police are now reporting that the offending beasts were not pteranodons after all , but pterodactyls . also , pteranodons are not even dinosaurs as this station previously stated – just winged reptile that lived about 70 million years after pterodactyls . finally , earlier we reported a death toll of zero when , in fact , the number is closer to 38. we regret these errors . it 's almost football season , and the night vale scorpions are gear ing up for a defense of the high school division title . but really , as long as we beat desert bluff , fan s and hooded figures alike will feel just fine . coach nazr al-mujaheed told reporter he 's particularly excited for the progress junior quarterback michael sandero made during the off-season , after that sentiment lightning bolt struck him and give him the strength of two keeps and the intelligence of a heavily concussed re ne descartes . but , if night vale is going to beat their bitter rivals this year , and st ave off the government-administered pestilence the follows a losing season record , sandero will have to improve his accuracy . last year , sandero only completed two out of 130 pass attempt – most notably because he was in advanced stages of cerebral palsy , and because his throwing hand had been removed due to several overdue library books . apparently the off-season lightning strike had healed sandero of his terminal ailments and court-ordered amputations , and he 's ready to take on desert bluff , which is probably the worst team ever . god , they ' re dreadful . and now , an editorial . let 's talk for a moment about apartment building etiquette . now , i myself live in an apartment building , and there is a compassion and acceptance you have to have for a certain level of annoyance . it 's people in close proximity to each other , and so there will be some things that you do not like , and still have to let go . but other things are absolutely unacceptable ! for instance , a certain level of strange radiating light or heat on shared walls is expected , but any oozing or visible membranes are rude and thoughtless to all of your neighbors . jabbering , howling , and ch ants in long-dead languages are the kind of thing that is fine at 1:00 pm , but absolutely not fine at 1:00 am . we are all in this together . put your trash in the can s , not in the halfway leading to the can s . put on some clothes when standing in front of your windows , and keep any rituals or crazed experiments to hours in which no one is trying to sleep . it does not have to be hard . we have a very unexpected treat today , dear listeners . live in the studio we have one of the mysterious hooded figures often seen around town . we did not actually invite him here , he just was waiting for us when we unlocked the studio this morning . he has not moved , nor spoken since then , and i ' ll be honest : i am only guessing that `` he '' is a he , because physical attributes are hard to determine under these robes , and the face is entirely hidden in shadow as empty and as black as the void of space . but hey , we ' re do in ' radio ! he 's in a radio station . let 's see if we can get an interview . mr . hooded figure , how are you doing today ? huh ... okay . care to comment on the recent expansion of the forbidden dog park ? any comments at all ? anything you d like to tell the ordinary folk of night vale about your organization ? listeners , i 'm sure you can here this . it 's not a problem with your radio or our transmitted . the hooded figure is making those noise in our studio . it 's pretty deafening , actually . alright ! i do not think he 's going to stop , and he 's started to levitate , so , let 's go to the weather . ladies and gentlemen , we have just received word from secret police that the rip in space-time that opened at last night 's pta meeting has been sealed at last . the final missing pterodactyl has been returned to its own timeline in either prehistoric or alternate-universe night vale . the creature 's lifeless body was found a dozen yards outside of the dog park entrance , stripped of all flesh , and with most of the organs inverted and st rung around its exposed skull like an old fashioned soft meats crown , as worn by the 18 th century religious leaders who settled our fair burgh . the dinosaur 's body was returned to the vortex , the gateway closed , and the pta meeting rescheduled for next tuesday at 6:00 pm . that meeting will continue to address the important issue of backpacks , and whether or not they are causing autism . there will also be a memorial service for the 38 parents and teachers who lost their lives in the attack – followed by a ruffle . remember , winners must be present at the time of the drawing to claim their prizes . city council and secret police have issued a reminder that night vale citizens of all species and all geologic er as are not to enter , look at , or think too long about the dog park . this reminder , they say , is completely unrelated to anything that may or may not have happened today . coming up next , stay tuned for our one-hour special , `` morse code for trumpet quietest . '' and listeners , night vale is an ancient place , full of history and secrets – as we were reminded today . but it is also a place of the present moment , full of life , and of us . if you can hear my voice speaking live , then you know : we are not history yet . we are happening now . how miraculous is that ? goodnight , listeners . goodnight . today 's proverb : what has four legs in the morning , two legs at noon , and three legs in the evening ? i do not know , but i trapped it in my bedroom . send help .
WTNV|The Shape in Grove Park|15 August 2012|close your eyes . let my words wash over you . you are safe now . welcome to night vale . local historians are protesting the removal of the shape in grove park that no one acknowledges or speaks about . while their protest has been hampered by the fact that none of them will acknowledge or speak about it , they did – through a system of gestures and grimace – convey the message that , whatever the shape is , and whatever its effects on nearby neighborhoods , it is a night vale landmarks and should be protected . the shape itself offered no comment – only a low moaning and gelatinous quiver . the city council would not provide any reason for the removal , but did say that any work in grove park was making way for a new swing set , picnic area , and blood stone circle , which we all can agree are good contributions to the community . the night vale green market co-op announced today that , after fifteen years , they will begin selling fruits and vegetables . green market board president tristan cortez said that recent customer surveys indicated that shippers have grown tired of empty pick up truck s and vacant tents lining the city hall parking lot every sunday morning in the summer and fall . cortez said that research indicates that consumers are more likely to buy products if they are available and for sale , and that green market and grocer shippers tend to purchase food items . cortez said that the decision to sell food at the green market was a controversial one , as many board members and co-op shareholder feel fruit and vegetable sales will interfere with their on going secretive domestic espionage operations . when reached for comment , our source within the secret police only breathed heavily into the phone while tapping and asset un cracked code into the receiver . michael sandero , starting quarter back for the night vale scorpions , has reportedly grown a second head . it is not currently known whether this is a result of the previously reported lightning strike , or just another odd coincidence in the kid ' s odd life . people in the know say that the new head is better looking and smarter than the first one , and even michael ' s mother has issued a statement indicating that she likes it much better than her son and that she will be changing the ran kings on the public ` ` which of my children i like best '' board outside her house . sandero could not be reached for comment . probably . we did not try . friends , listeners ; there ' s a real tarantula problem here in night vale . many residents have called in to report that illiteracy , unwanted pregnancy , and violent crime are on the rise in the tarantula communities . animal control is addressing these concerns through after school programs called ` ` teach a spider to read – stop the madness . '' those interesting in volunteering should stand in their bathtubs and weep until it is all gone . nothing left . you can let go now . let go . shhhhh . let go . and now a message from our sponsor . tired of your home ? sick of comfort ? come to the hole in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s and huddled with us . who are we ? good question . come to the hole in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s and huddled with us . why do we want you to come ? why did we spend money for this air time ? we understand you are confused . but : hole , vacant lot , ralph ' s , huddled , us . for the low-low price . act today . or tomorrow . not wednesday . wednesday is no good for us . anyway , we ' re almost out of air time , so just come on down to the hole in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s and huddled with us . or else . back to our regularly schedule programming . ladies and gentlemen , the rumor mill is buzz . we ' ve had a celebrity sight ing in our little burgh ! old woman josie and one of her angel friends reportedly saw rite haworth getting gas at the fuel ‘ n go over by the bowl ing alley . rite haworth , ladies and gentlemen ! right here in night vale . can you believe it ? old woman josie said rite was looking a bit older , moderately obese , and considerably more his panic , but the angel assured her it was indeed rite . he is an angel after all ... he would know , right ? wo w ! rite haworth ! right here in night vale ! just imagine ! update on the shape formerly in grove park that no one acknowledges or speaks about : it seems the city council , in their superhuman mercy and all-seeing glory have chosen to move the shape directly in front of our own radio station , where it is continuing to be what can only be described as ... indescribable . the shape was not available for comment as i could find no one willing to speak to it ... or even meet my eye when i mentioned it . it has occurred to me that i may be the only one able to see it . now that i think about it , i have also never bother ed to actually check whether this mi c is attached to any sort of recording or broadcast ing device . and it is possible that i am alone in an empty universe , speaking to no one , unaware that the world is held aloft merely by my delusions and my smooth , sonorous voice . more on this story as it develops , i say , possibly only to myself . the night vale community theater is holding additions for its fall show ` ` once on this island . '' interested hessians should bring a head shot and resume to the recreation center auditoriums on thursday night . all auditionees must perform a one-minute monologue and sing one song . bring sheet music if you would like piano accompaniment . auditionees will also be required to do a cold reading , and give blood and stool samples along with mandatory radiation testing following the additions . do not sing anything from south pacific . people of color are urged to addition , as night vale community theater is an equal-opportunity employer . also , actors with long-range sniper training , fort ran computer programming , and top-notch wilderness survival skill are a plus . final casting will be announced in secret via dirigible . no one can ever know . update on the green market situation from earlier in our broadcast . everything is exactly the same as when we last reported on it . there is no new information . listeners , do you ever think about the moon ? i was sitting outside last night looking at the moon and i thought , does anyone actually know what that thing is ? have there been any studies on this ? i went to ask carlos , but he has not been seen much since that treacherous telly ' s vile hair cut . the moon ' s weird though , right ? it ' s there , and there , and then suddenly it ' s not . and it seems to be pretty far up . it is watching us ? if not , what is it watching instead ? is there something more interesting than us ? hey , watch us moon ! we may not always be the best show in the universe , but we try . this has been today ' s children ' s fun fact science corner . speaking of which , the night vale school district has announced some changes to the elementary school curriculum . they are as follows : in response to parent feedback , history class will focus more heavily on textbook reading and traditional exam , rather than live am mo drills . geology is adding a new type of rock on the grounds that it ' s been a while since anyone has done that . the new type of rock is ` ` timber , '' and it is categories by its pale blue color , and the fact that it is completely edible . points will be awarded to the first student to discover a real-world example of it . ma th and english are switch ing names . their curriculum will stay exactly the same . astronomy will now be conducting star gazing sessions only with blindfold on every participant , in order to protect them from the existential terror of the void . also , plato has been declared imaginary . all classroom will be equipped with at least one teacher physically present for the entire instruction period . astray projection will no longer be used in any classroom situation . finally , in addition to the current foreign language offerings of spanish , french , and modified sumerian , schools will now be offering double spanish , weird spanish , optic spanish , russian , and modified sumerian . and now a continuation of our previous investigation into whether i am literally the only person in the world , speaking to myself in a fit of madness caused by my inability to admit the tragedy of my own existence . leland , our newest inter , recently brought me a cup of coffee . he is no longer in my field of vision , but i do still have the cup of coffee , which is well made and is given me the needed pick-me-up to continue considering this terrifying possibility . is it possible that i only imagined leland , and forgot making myself this cup of coffee ? but then , who would have grown this coffee ? where was this coffee cup procured from ? oh , leland ' s back in the room . he ' s waving at me – hello , leland – and he ' s saying ... wait , what was that , leland ? i see . he ' s saying that the shape has turned a often red and is causing small whirlwind in front of our radio station doors . there is apparently a sound of a great many voices chanting as though it were an army giving out a battle cry before raining down destruction on our arid little hamlet . oh ? he has stopped shouting , and is now writing furiously on a piece of paper . i have to say , leland ' s existence , as well as his finally speaking about the shape that no one else would speak about , has reassured me greatly about my lonely and solipsistic vigil here at this microphone . he is handing me the note – thank you , leland – le m me see here ... ah h . it says that the city council believes the reason for the violent reaction of the shape formerly in grove park that no one acknowledges or speaks about is because i have been acknowledging and speaking about it , which has made it angry . they urge me to stop speaking of it , and never do it again , and in exchange they ' ll move it somewhere else so we can get our front loading zone back . after brief consideration ... i have decided to accept the council ' s offer , because they are trustworthy leaders looking out for our better future , and also because leland just got vaporized by a strange red light emanating from the station entrance . to the family of leland , we thank you for his service to the cause of community radio , and join you in mourning his loss . and , without further ado , nor ever again mentioning anything we should not , let ' s go to the weather . hello listeners . in breaking news , the sky . the earth . life . existence as an unchanging plane with horizons of birth and death in the faint distance . we have nothing to speak about . there never was . words are an unnecessary trouble . expression is time wasting away . any communication is just a yelp in the darkness . ladies , gentlemen , listeners , you . i am speaking now but i am saying nothing . i am just making noise and , as it happens , they are organized in words and you should not draw meaning from this . the service for leland will be lovely . we will throw flowers and weep . he will be buried in the break room as is the custom . his family will come and moon about the coffee as though we have answers . we do not have answers . i am not certain that we even have questions . i have chosen to not be certain of anything at all . this is cecil , generally , speaking to you , metaphorically , for night vale community radio . and i would like to say in the most nebulous terms possible , and with no real world implication or insinuating of objective meaning : good night , listeners . good night . today ' s proverb : a million dollars is not cool . you know what ' s cool ?

WTNV|The Drawbridge|1 September 2012|rabbits are not what they seem to be . welcome to night vale . we ' ve had some power outrages reported throughout night vale in the last couple of hours . if you ' re experiencing one ... well then you ca not hear me , can you ? the night vale municipal utility department said that they are still working to determine the cause of the outrages , which are roving back and forth across town in a continuous motion , like a great pacing beast . those whose neighborhoods have been hit by the outrages reported the shriek of hawk overhead , and that when the lights came back on , they felt that perhaps they were different people – their memories and identified were the same as always , but suddenly felt like costumes that did not fit exactly . as though it all were actually brand new to them . as though they had been switched out with someone who was exactly like them . as though all that was familiar would ever after be strange . keep some flash lights with spare batteries and a childhood photo album by you tonight , just in case . the revitalization of the old town draw bridge experienced another set back this week , as engineers determined that the furniture upholstery used to construct the bridge towers s oaks up water and creates an unstable foundation . this week ' s collapse was the third in as many months . construction crews have tried building the bridge tower base supports from corrupted cardboard , non-dairy dreamer , and chromic bowls . nothing has worked . engineers are asking for help in determining how proper bridge towers are made . if you have any tips , please write them on notebook paper and mail them to bridge magic , ll po box 616 do not use cursive or long words . clearly labelled drawings are preferred . ladies and gentlemen , it ' s that time of year again . time for our annual pledge drive . sorry to have to do this , but , you know , night vale has a lot of community-supported radio , and the thing about community-supported radio ... it ' s supported by listeners like you . as well as guatemala and some teamster , who are , sometimes , just too generous . any amount you can give will help us continue our community programming . a dollar , or two , or even plasma . take wzzz , our local numbers station , broadcast ing from that strange and tall antenna built out back of the abandoned gas station on oxford street . did you know that it broadcast a monotony female voice reading out seemingly random numbers interspersed with chimes twenty four hours a day , seven days a week ? as you can imagine , that kind of work does not bring in a lot of money – unless it does . to be honest , here at night vale radio we do not know exactly what that station is for , or what master it is serving . but i do know that it is a vital part of this community , and we should pitch in to help it . we welcome your support . give us a call ! we do not have a number ; just whisper , ` ` forsaken algonquins
WTNV|History Week|15 September 2012|it is almost complete . it is almost complete at last . welcome to night vale . hello , there . as you well know , faithful listeners , it is night vale history week , in which we all learn a little bit about what made our bustling little town what it is . or , as the official motto released by the city council goes , ` ` po ke about in the black recesses of the past until it devours our fragile present . '' in the interest of civic participation , night vale community radio will be pitching in with short lessons about some points of interest from our town ' s history , starting with 4000 bc . archaeologists believe that this is the earliest date of human settlement in night vale . little remains of these ancient inhabitants except a few cave paintings of their towns and their hunting practices , and of the dark shapes that would watch them in the distance . inhuman , shimmering shapes that never came closer or farther away , but whose presence could be felt even with eyes shut tight , huddled in fur and the company of another human ' s naked skin . or so i 'm extrapolating from the evidence . the cave paintings mainly resemble smudge now , after their original discovered attempted to power-wash them off the wall because he , on religious grounds , did not believe in the past . and now the news : the night vale tourism board asks that whoever is telepathically assailing the tourist please stop . according to the not executive director , madeline fleur , there were two separate incidents in one week of entire tour bu ses suddenly shrieking in bridled terror and trying to blind themselves using rolled-up ` ` visible night vale '' brochure – all to the utter confusion of the bus drivers . fleur added , ` ` we just had those brochure printed . '' fleur claims that tourism accounts for tens of thousands of dollars annually for night vale , and the town prides itself on hospitality . she said that if goodhearted families travel to night vale only to find their subconsciouses besieged with unforgettable revelation , horrors buried so deep as to be completely indescribable , revealing wholly unbearable new truths , then we certainly ca not expect these people to return ... let alone leave good yelp rating for local business es . the city is asking residents for help in determining who , or what , is causing these psychological infractions . the tourism board is offering supplies as a reward for information on this case . or , even if you do not have information , the city asks that you come get a puppy or two anyway . seriously . downtown municipal offices are overrun with them . in the trees , walls , carpentry ... the exterminators are completely stymied by this infestation . please help . it has been several weeks since anyone in night vale has seen the apache track er – that white guy who wears the inaccurate and horribly offensive indian headdress everywhere . he has not been seen since he began investigation the great screaming heard at the post office , and the words written in blood inside . also the entire structure of his house has vanished , and the lot where it stood is now a bu colic meadow that neighborhood kid s will not ever enter for reasons even they are unable to explain . i think i speak for everyone in the community when i say good radiance to that local embarrassment . he made the whole town look ignorant and racism . and now , let us continue with our night vale history week special feature . the year 1745 : the first white men arrived in night vale . which was not night vale then , but was rather just another part of a large and featureless desert . i think we can all agree , though , that even as large and featureless as the desert was , the part that would eventually become desert bluff was still probably awful and drab in comparison to our part . in any case , the story goes that a party of explorers came to the area that would be night vale , looked around , and immediately left to go find somewhere with more water , and maybe some trees . then another three parties of explorers did the same thing . then finally , one party of explorers all looked at each other , shrugged , and plopped down their stuff ... and thus was a proud city born . and now , traffic . crews from the department of public safety will be re painting highway lane markets this week . the common white dash es and double yellow lane divides will be replaced with colourful chromic mosaic depicting disgruntled south american workers rising en masse against an abusive capitalist ceremony . the protective steel barriers along curves in the road will be taken down to make room for some really lovely and provocative butcher-paper silhouettes of slavery-era self-mutilation , reflective of several centuries of slow genocide and dehumanization by western imperialism , designed by contemporary art darling ka ra walker . also , ex its 15 to 17 along route 800 will be closed for the next two saturdays because of the biennial lee margin film introspective . so please watch for working crews this weekend , lower your speed , and do not forget to tip the des shift leaders . 20 % of your current mileage is standard . lack of tipping is the leading cause of sinkholes in the u.s. the year 1824 : the first meeting of the town elder council , predecessors to the city council . picture them : crimson robes and soft meat crowns ( as was traditional at the time ) , setting the groundwork for the splendor of today ' s night vale . a number of elements of our modern civic process were invented in that single three-hour meeting , including the city council membership ( since unchanged ) , the lovably byzantine tax system ( as well as the system of brutal penalties for mistakes ) and the official town song , chant , and moan . all records of this meeting were destroyed , and ... according to a note being passed to me just now , i am to report to city hall for re education effective tomorrow morning . oh , dear . the results of a recent survey of night vale residents came to light this week . the study found widespread dissatisfaction with our town ' s public library . and , when considering the facts , it ' s easy to see why . the public computers for internet use are outdated and slow . the lending period of 14 days is not nearly long enough to read lengthen books , given the busy schedules of all our lives . the fatality rate is also well above the national average for public libraries . the library blood stone circle does not appear to have seen any maintenance or cleaning in some time . there are reports of a careless specter moving about the biography section , picking off lone browsers one by one . and that biography section , by the way , is far too small and has been oddly curate – containing 33 copies of the official biography of helen hunt , and no other books . from top to bottom , the public library is a disgrace to our fair city and i can only hope that our city council does something about that soon , or i may find myself hoping that the careless specter puts the library to the same mysterious , violent end as its many victims . night vale high won the grudge match against the desert bluff cultures last night . two-headed quarter back michael sandero credits the win to help from angels ! the angels have made an adamant denial of any involvement whatsoever in the game . the school district ethics committee has announced that they will look into any possible ` ` angelic interference '' . speaking of which , night vale high school is adding metal detector , and parents and students alike are outraged . several parents we talked to said that news students have long been recipients of shadow government-issued zis and rifles , as well as tapers and armor-piercing munitions . the school board ' s decision to put up metal detector , according to parents , impinges on the clandestine operation ' s rights as a vast underground conspiracy of giant megacorporations and corrupt world leaders to bear arms via teenage paramilitary proxies . the school board countered that studies indicate that weapons distract from educators ' ability to educate , and that students who bring firearms to classroom are more likely to use firearms than students without firearms . the school board says that school shooting can only get in the way of a quality education . well ... at the risk of becoming too much a part of this story , dear listeners , might i say that the night vale school district is overstepping its bounds by telling us whether or not our children can be armed by undercover militant ? should it be a school ' s job to say , ` ` no , child , you can not have grenade or assault rifles in the classroom '' ? i think not ! beginning november first , all students at news will enter the school through metal detector . any firearms or weaponry found will be confiscated and held in the counselor ' s office until after school , when the students can pick them up again . seriously , listeners , what ' s next ? removing the line ` ` praise the beams , praise , o ye knowing beams that guide our lives , our hearts , our souls ; praise o highest to ye all-powerful beams '' from the pledge of allegiance ? ! let ' s return to another key moment in night vale history . the year 1943 : as part of the war effort , night vale citizens dedicated themselves to chanting . the young , the old , men and women alike gathered around their bloodstones and chant ed for the victory of the united states . while some credit must be given to the strategic planning of us command , and to the brave fighting of american soldiers , most reputable scholars believe that night vale ' s chanting was the deciding factor in america ' s eventual victory over the axis powers . the city council erected a seven-story monument in grove park saying so in large , ne on letters ... until a federal lawsuit forced them to take it down . and now , a word from our sponsors . that word is carp . this next installment in our exploration of night vale ' s storied past takes place in the future . the year 2052 : the schon of the dark order will descend , realize he mistimed the prophecy , and re-ascend . the seventh siege of the great night vale temple will rage on . the plague of buzzing boils will kill thousands , and annoy thousands more , with its buzzing . the city council will reveal its true form and eat half of night vale ' s population . approval rating for the mayor will hover in the low 40 s ... which will be surprising , as there will have been no mayor for over thirty years . and now , the weather ! the night vale business association announced today that the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area was not actually something that ever existed in reality , but was instead a shared hallucinations of the entire town ' s population . as such , they are proud to declare that they have never suffered any sort of disastrous business failure , and the reportedly massive amounts of money lost on building waterfront facilities in a desert are fabrication of our collective consciousness . they recommend consulting your dream interpretation manual to determine exactly what this ` ` night vale harbor '' vision could mean . they also said that if you happen to stumble on the waterfront buildings out in the desert exactly where you remembered them , and they seem completely real , standing as vacant and useless as the day they were built , that ' s because you are still hallucinations and should seek medical treatment immediately . or have a member of the city council howl at you if you are of the old en faith , and do not believe in modern medicine . for our final story in this week ' s features look into the history of night vale , let ' s look at the very recent past . yesterday : i had cereal for breakfast , a sandwich for lunch , speak for dinner . cars were driven , cars were not driven . the sun gave a great shout of light and then , after several hours of thought , quietly retracted the statement . old woman josie dug up a box in a shady corner of her yard and carried it , cradled in her arms like a baby or a delicate explosive , to another part of her yard where she buried it again . an unknown person did something that no one else saw , the nature and extent of which is impossible to determine , and the result of which will be lost in the chronic chain of causation and consequence that is history . but most importantly , all of us – all of us here in night vale , in america , in the world , in the secret orbital bases – all of us got through another day . we passed the time from one end of twelve to the other without stopping once . well done , us ! good job , people who experience time ! time experiences ! good job ! and , from this moment in history , the one that ' s happening right now ... good night . today ' s proverb : it must be 3:23 pm somewhere . maybe space ?
WTNV|The Lights in Radon Canyon|1 October 2012|silence is golden . words are vibration . thoughts are magic . welcome to night vale . next saturday is the big lottery drawing , listeners , right out in front of city hall . and your community radio station has put together a few helpful tips for winning . the lottery is , of course , mandatory , but how can you get the best odds for drawing a blank white paper , and not one of the purple pieces that means you ' ll be ceremonial disemboweled and eaten by the wolves at the night vale petting z oo and makeshift carnival ? i know to some of you young people this lottery seems like a barbarous , outdated tradition . but if not for a municipally-planned citizen sacrifice each quarter , how else would we find satisfactory meats to feed those sad , scrawny animals ? so here now are the ` ` three i ' s '' of playing the lottery : ` ` i '' one : identify . learn to sense colors . purple has a gritti er emotional au ra than white . ` ` i '' two : igni te . set fire to your home . while it ' s not true that wolves refuse to eat arsonists , it ' s a scientific fact that they ' re unable to detect the presence of one . ` ` i '' three : imitate . if you happen to draw a purple piece , impersonate someone who drew a white piece . you might be mistaken for a person who is color blind . this , of course , will lead to months of painful color re-education at city hall . but , in most cultures , that ' s better than being eaten by wolves . also , make sure to visit the food truck festival , which will be downtown as part of the lottery festivities . popular truck treats include korean barbecue , vegetarian chi li , and veal ice cream . carlos , this station ' s favorite scientist ( no offense to dr . babinski in the night vale community college chemistry department ) dropped by our broadcast ing station earlier this morning for a little chat . sadly , dinner or weekend plans were not among the topics . however , carlos did request that we ask listeners for anyone who saw a series of bright , colourful flicked coming from ra don canyon this past weekend . these flicked would also have also been accompanied by unintelligible noise – possibly some form of cod ed communication or signal-jamming technique . carlos suggested that there could be some very sinister forces at work here . he declined to be interview ed live , claiming only that he was scared for us . scared for all of us in our strange town . then he drove away quickly in his economical but attractively sport horrid couple . if anyone out there knows anything about these otherworldly lights and sounds , please contact us immediately . night vale school superintendent nick ford , announced today that the glow cloud has joined the school board . the glow cloud passed over the entirety of night vale several weeks ago – dropping small and large animal carcasses , controlling our thoughts and tertiary muscle groups , and easing every last recording device . we ' re still un sure the glow cloud even existed , as no one remembers it , nor has any digital record of it . if not for a few intrepid citizens who used old-fashioned pens and pencils to record the event in their diaries , we would have no remaining knowledge of that day . i , of course , can only thank those journal writers anonymous here on the air , as the night vale city council long ago ban ned writing utensils – along with margaret glasses and bar code scanners – and i do not want to get my fellow reporter in any trouble with the sheriff ' s secret police . according to superintendent ford , the glow cloud ' s visit on that nearly-forgotten day was simply an effort to find a nice neighborhood with good schools to raise a child . now what kind of progeny a powerful , formless cloud formed of noxious nightmare and spiritual destruction might produce , i dare not even speculate . but i do know one thing : that little cloud is going to get one neck of an education in the night vale school district . and is not it hastening to hear that that little puff of despair ' s father , or mother , will serve on the school board ? i mean , no matter how good the school , a student can only get out as much as the parents put in . we should all take such an impactful role in our children ' s scholastic lives . especially you , steve carlsberg . you do not do anything except bring unacceptable dry scones to pta meetings and take grammatical ly disastrous minutes on your shifts as meeting secretary . get it together , steve ! superintendent ford offered the following statement of support for the newest school board member : ` ` all hail ! kneel for the glow cloud . sacrifice . pestilence . sores . all hail the glow cloud ! '' and now , traffic . this morning , i saw a running man . he passed by my home . panting . limping . running desperate . i tried to stop him , but he would not meet my eye . this noon time , i saw a running man . he was coming down from the mountain , holding a bag . his knees were bloody , and face covered in tears . this evening , i saw a running man . he was leaving town , legs pump ing like a terrified heart . i think he was missing a hand . is it that he would not meet my eye , or that he had no eyes ? now i wish i could remember . there are many things i wish i could remember . this has been traffic . new billboards have appeared all over town , bearing the image of a turkey sandwich and the single word ` ` harlot '' in large , block letters . these billboards have caused some confusion – both due to their ambiguous message and to the fact that the entire structure of the billboards materialized overnight in places billboards are not usually constructed , such as the living rooms of local homes , the middle of busy thoroughfare ( causing multiple car accidents ) , and , in one case , directly through a living dog , who does not appear harmed by the addition to his body , and has carried the entire billboard around town while going about his usual ca nine business . the department of health and human services recently claimed responsibility for the billboards , saying that they were part of a campaign to promote nutrition and healthy living among children . the original draft of the release also mentioned something about an offering to a long-dead god , but this was altered to ` ` fun , active lifestyle are important for kid s of all ages '' in a subsequent addendum . we ' re receiving several phone calls from listeners , and from the parks department , that those flickering lights and unintelligible noise we reported on earlier were coming from the pink floyd multimedia laser spectacular . i contracted carlos about this , and he said that the situation is even worse than he imagined . he , again , did not mention weekend plans . a sports scandal has shook our quiet little town . the night vale scorpions have faced multiple allegation of possible game tampering this football season . representatives for the desert bluff school district , speaking in unpleasant and high-pitched voices indicative of weakness of will and character , complained to the regional football and traffic code authority that night vale quarter back michael sandero ' s recently-grown second head counts as a twelfth man on the field , thus invalidating the wins brought on by his also recently-acquired superhuman agility and strength . the rftca said that they would look into these allegation with the utmost seriousness , along with their concurrent investigation into whether night vale ' s ` ` invisible crossway '' policy is actually a desperate bid to save town funds at the cost of pedestrian lives . meanwhile , the school board is due to announce its decision in the on going hearings as to whether appealing to angels for a win constitutes illegal game tampering . several angels agreed to testify at the hearings , however their testimonials were cut short when it became apparent that the hearings were actually elaborate traps set up by the city council to finally capture the angels , whom the council does not recognize as actually existing . fortunately , the angels easily escaped from their cases in a blaze of heavenly light , presumably returning to old woman josie ' s house , out near the car lot , which has become something of an informal shelter for local angels . when asked about the controversy over his team ' s winning record , coach nazr al-mujaheed said , ` ` our boys are good boys . they ' re good boys at football . we win ‘ em . with the boys . the football . '' then he smiled vacantly , waved at no one , and wandered off in the direction of the woods . more on this story as it develops . and now , a word from our sponsor . step into your nearest subways restaurant today , and try their new 6-inch ma shed potato sub ! top it with a delicious assortment of fresh vegetables , like french fries and patella . they ' ll even toast or poach it for you ! there are several subways locations in night vale , all easily accessible through witchcraft and chanting . and between now and november 30 , buy nine reverse colonies and get a free 40-ounce soda or freshly baked tobacco cookie . subways : devour your own empty heart . exciting news about the abandoned mine shaft outside of town , where people who vote incorrectly are taken by the secret police : ho on demand will be made available to prisoners during their indefinite detention . all your favorite shows , such as the wire , sex and the city , and even new hits like game of thrones , will be available in every cell . additional , the secret police announced that they will be random executing one prisoner a day until all incorrect votes are corrected . this just in : we ' re receiving word from the city council that there was absolutely not a pink floyd multimedia laser spectacular this weekend at ra don canyon ... that there was never a pink floyd multimedia laser spectacular ever near night vale . ` ` pink floyd is not even a thing , '' said the council in a very stern , but quiet , statement just received by me , here , via phone . the council ... and this is strange ... the entire council – not just a representative of the council , the entire council – issued this statement , all speaking in unison , just now , over the phone : that night vale citizens are prohibited from discussing any lights or sounds coming from ra don canyon this past weekend , and that they should just stop remembering pink floyd shows altogether . the council reiterated that there is no way that they are huge floyd fan s , privately using public funds on a laser-powered stance to talk ` ` hard-rockin ' classic ja ms '' with the ghost of original front man sad garrett , and that sad ` ` would not even say anything juice anyway , because he is such a gentleman , and an artist . '' this did not happen at all . so , listeners , we urge you to look away from ra don canyon . avert your eyes , ears , and memories from that which is no longer allowed you . comfort and distract yourselves with dense food and television programming . as the old ad age goes : ` ` a life of pain is the pain of life , and you can never escape it – only hope it hides , unknown , in a drawer like a poisonous spider and never comes out again , even though it probably will , in unexpected and horrific fashion , sca ring you from being able to comfortably conduct even the most mundane , quotidian tasks . '' or , at least , that ' s how my grandparents always phrased it . and now , the weather . teddy williams , over at the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , has an update on the doorway into that vast , underground city he found in the pin retrieval area of lane five . he says that every window of the city is now glowing both day and night . and he heard the shouts and footsteps of what sounds like an army marching upwards toward the world above . he also said that , given that nothing really matters now , bowl ing is half-off and each game comes with a free basket of wings . mmm , nothing like those desert flower wings ! let me leave you with this , dear listeners . we lead frantic lives . filled with needs and responsibilities , but completely devoid of any actual purpose . i say let ' s try to enjoy the simple things . life should be like a basket of chicken wings : sal ty , full of fat and vinegar , and surrounded by every you ' ll never actually eat , even when you ' re greedily sopping up the last viscous streaks of buffalo sauce from the wax paper with your spit-stained index finger . yes , that is as life should be , night vale . stay tuned next for a special live broadcast of the night vale symphony orchestra performing eugene o'neill ' s classic play the ice man cometh . it is a good night , listeners . good night . today ' s proverb : we are living in an material world – a ghost world , and i am an material girl – a ghost .

'' it has made no movement , despite repeated tapering by the sheriff ' s secret police . many suspect that this may be a publicity stunt pulled by our own local cereal company , flakes o ' s , who are launching their new line of nighttime-only cereals next month . an angry mob has formed outside of the cereal factory , just in case . telly . you remember , the deceitful barber with a shriveled soul who . just a few weeks ago . cut perfect scientist carlos ' perfect , beautiful hair very short – so very , very short – thus depriving our community of our only remaining pleasure . well , telly was seen recently , wandering the sand wastes , howling at the sky , and holding up carlos ' shorn locks as though begging god to reverse the crime he has done . reports indicate that his skin was blistering , that his eyes were bleary , and that he was recently seen trying to give a cactus a hair cut , whispering and cooing into what he seemed to think was its ear . listeners , i am not one to stand aside harshly and say that a man deserves the punishment that comes to him , but i also am not sorry to see telly in this state , given his crime . in any case , if your cactus is in need of a hair cut , try telly , out wandering the sand wastes . ladies and gentlemen , i must say that i am not a cat person . but i have really grown to love khoshekh , the stray cat that has made his home here at the radio station . i discovered khoshekh several weeks ago , covering in a fixed location in the men ' s bathroom – and he ' s remained there ever since . the men at the station , of course , have taken to keeping the sink at a light trickle , so he can get water , and we even take turns buying science diet low-calorie cat food . it turns out little khoshekh is getting a bit chubby , since he ca not actually exercise in his un movable , levitating state . oh , and thanks to our new inter , br ad , we ' ve finally solved the litter problem . br ad is very excellent at both carpentry and dark magic , so he rigged us up a fine-looking litter box that our floating fe line friend can reach . he ' s just adorable , that cat ! as a life-long dog lover , i ' ve really turned the corner . khoshekh is wonderful ! i know several others here at the station who feel the same way . after meeting khoshekh , mckayla , who works in sales , put her three-year-old weimaraner to sleep and then adopted six cabby kitten . she ' s that much of a convert ! make sure to take some cut e video , mckayla ! and for others of you interested in getting a new cat , the night vale sca strongly recommends that you have your cat spayed or entered , bring them in for their shots and , once the cat reaches 18 months , begin using the little beast to harvest human organs for those ` ` just in case '' moments . the sca has several one-sheets on preventing heart worms and using pets to grow small replacement organs . to get your copy , go online or simply make up your own information facts . an update on the pyramid reported on earlier : word is in that the pyramid has spoken . it is broadcast ing , on low-wave frequencies , a repeated message . the message is the following : ` ` i will place within some of you questions . within others , i will place answers . these questions and these answers will not always align . the questions i provide may have no answers , and the answers i provide may have no questions . i will study the effects of these questions , and these answers . some of you will hurt others , and others will heal . grow my seeds inside you , and let them flower . '' the flakes o ' s marketing department must be complimented for the best use of vital marketing in night vale since stan ' s pawn shop released a virulent strain of ebola back in ‘ 98 . and , as a communicator by trade , i applaud their ingenuity . the sheriff ' s secret police has responded with surface-to-surface missiles which , they say , will ` ` silence the dark heart of the beast . '' so far , they have not so much as created a smudge on the pyramid ' s broad , shiny surface . home bandsmen , fixity viens , ladies and gentlemen who love to get their hands dirty , let ' s talk about home repair . certain jobs are fine for the amateur , and certain others should be left to the professional . leaky sinks , sticky windows , minor exercises , and bleeding doors – all these are the kind of quick fixes ' that a tool box and a quick search on the internet should allow you to take care of . on the other hand , structural damage , major modeling , seeping darkness , major exercises , roof boils , and lawn care – these are all the kind of work that should not be attempted by anyone without years of expertise and a valid hammer license from the city council . finding the right professional for the job is easy . just look at the yellow pages . or head down to the squatter shacks by the edge of the sand wastes and ask around among the homeless . and now , a public service announcement from the night vale medical community . being in the desert , we get a lot of sun , and doctors are encouraging night vale citizens to do regular skin checks . you may think that freckled or mole is harmless , but you never know when it will grow into something much worse . surgeons at night vale general hospital are noting an up tick in dermatological growths related to sun exposure . doctors describe these growths as ` ` 15-inch spiral ed horns . '' the horns mostly protrude from the lower back or knees . checked , these horns can develop a glistening shine , small leather saddles , and bright red lips on the very tip . so check your skin at least once a week in the mirror . dermatologists recommend a three-step process . search meticulously for 15-inch horns protruding from your body . do not overlook anything . if you find any suspicious growths , mark them with a chalk pentagon . gently remove the affected skin area with a sterilised razor blade , or similarly clean craft ing blade . if you are not one of the 53 % of our community that was born without pain-sensing nerves , you should first consult your primary care electrolysis for tips on how to numb yourself to the nigh-unbearable pain of existence . the department of public safety announced that all street signs in night vale will be replaced with traffic cop s wielding seashore flags . drivers will be required to learn this physically expressive maritime alphabet . this decision is not without its controversy , as the existing street signs are entirely in braille . one critic , paul birmingham , says removing these signs will def late the earth . as a member of the air-filled earth society , paul believes that earth is a precariously-inflated orb that could pop or sa g at any moment . ` ` we ' ve got ta stop teaching all this religious propaganda in our schools and start teaching real science , '' paul shouted from his lean-to behind the library . i have to admit , listeners , he makes a valid point . and now , a word from our sponsor . today ' s program is brought to you by audible.com , your online source for recorded books . there are thousands of great titles at audible.com that you can download to your computer , or portable device , and listen to on the go . i use audible to catch up on best-selling titles like ` ` the help '' and ` ` vango-notes for technical communication 11\e .

WTNV|Feral Dogs|1 November 2012|regret nothing , until it is too late . then regret everything . welcome to night vale . our top story today : a roving pack of fera dogs has been terrorising night vale for the past several hours . the dogs have been described as mostly butts , possibly pit bull mix es . witnesses say their apparent leader is the three-headed one wearing dozens of decorative service medals and chevrons . sheriff ' s secret police confirmed that the dog pack has already attacked a group of elementary school children this morning , around eight , as they were getting on the bus . injuries were minor , as the children protected themselves ably with their school-issued nerve gas canister and automatic pistols . the dogs ' motives are not yet known , although authorities believe it could be me th and/or gang related . more on this story as it develops . this friday afternoon , the parks department will be spraying pesticide in all public park areas , and in neighborhoods with dense foliage and predominantly irish heritage . night vale is making a strong effort to reduce the mosquito population , and the dangerous diseases that they carry . last year , mosquitoes were responsible for outbreaks of west nile , influenza , pan ache , elephantiasis , and fanny br ice approximation syndrome . please stay indoors from 1:00 pm friday until 10:00 pm saturday to avoid dermal contact with the pesticide – which has been known to cause skin abrasions , epilepsy , super epilepsy , and organ inversion . the parks department also notes that the pesticide has a half-life of 2,100 years , which means we ' ll be safe from those annoying mosquitoes for a long time . we just received word from wayne tyler , assistant shift manager at the new pinkberry , that the pack of fera dogs was seen this morning root ing around in the dumpsters behind the library . they made off with some discarded chinese take-out container , a rusty fulton frame , and two homeless men – likely to become henchpeople to the wild dogs . if you are near the library , be warned that these dogs are dangerous . also , be warned that penalties for overdue books have skyrocketed to fifty cents per day and , after thirty days , jaw mutilation . the night vale medical board has issued a new study indicating that you have a spider somewhere on your body at all times , but especially now . the study said that further research would be needed to determine exactly where on your body the spider is , and what its intentions are . only that it is definitely there , and that it is statistical likely to be one of the really ugly ones . let ' s go now to community health tips . listeners : are you suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome ? are you enjoying carpal tunnel syndrome ? are you surprised by carpal tunnel syndrome ? are you enraged by carpal tunnel syndrome ? do you feel a throbbing sadness that you almost can not stand from carpal tunnel syndrome ? do you feel a bounty of love and appreciation for your fellow human beings traveling through this confusing and finite lifetime with you from carpal tunnel syndrome ? do you get sexually aroused by carpal tunnel syndrome ? that would be weird . not to be judgment al , but ... it would be weird . this has been community health tips . listeners , we ' ve just learned that the draw bridge construction site has been hit by graffiti canals . the sheriff ' s secret police suspect the fera dog pack to be responsible for the giant spray-painted letter ing along the bridge scaffolding that reads : gold standard is our standard and read your constitution there was also a very elaborate ly painted portrait of alexander hamilton wearing groucho marx nose glasses , with a caution that reads : federalist papers ... but where federalist is crossed out , and toilet is written in red . actually , you should see this . it ' s truly stunning . all that with spray paint – i 'm impressed ! these guy s are really good artists ! nevertheless , these dogs are possibly armed , and possibly rabid . they are definitely librarian street artists , and that has police and city officials working double-time to solve this problem . if you have any tips that could lead to the capture of this roving band of dogs , please , keep them to yourself . we ' ve also received word that they have tapped your phone and computers , so best not leave the house or talk loudly . let ' s have a look at the community calendar . this sunday afternoon , the night vale fire department will be holding its bi-weekly fire person appreciation parade . all of the town ' s firefighters will be riding through main street on their bright red engines , which will be turned into float depicting some of the greatest fires in night vale ' s history . one of my personal favorites is the 1983 earthquake dust fire , when tremor-initiated fires became so intense that the air borne sand burst into deadly flames . nearly the entire city population was lost , and the fdnv does a fantastic job capturing the drama with streamers and paper mac he . the fire department would like to remind night vale citizens that the parade is free , and to check your coffee makers and gas stoves before you leave home , because they will not fight any fires while the parade is happening . on monday , the staff of dark owl records will be wearing sweat er vests . tuesday night is the boy scouts ' court of honor . the b sa will name its first-ever blood-pact scouts – the rank just above eagle scout . so far , no scout has attained the coveted position of eternal scout , but we have heard that two local boys , franklin wilson and barton donovan , have earned the in visibility badge , which is a pre requisite for the rank . well done , frank and bar ty . wednesday afternoon is the city-wide fitness fair at the rec center . last year ' s event was canceled , as it was held on the same day and at the same time as the fried chicken and cigarette fair . this year ' s event , however , promises to be a huge success , as they have secured a large corporate sponsorship from the intelligence group international – who will provide free prostate screening , mammograms , and surgically-embedded government monitoring devices . thursday morning , the national weather service and national security agency have schedule a giant sandstone . friday is an oasis . only a metaphor for something unattainable . a hunting dream of meaning for our lives , but do not look ! turn your head . your life is here . stay here . you are alone . you are so peacefully alone . that ' s it . yes . goooood . we ' ve contracted the night vale z oo , hoping to find out more information on how dogs behave in packs . perhaps these skilled animal experts could give us some insight into how to catch these dogs , or at least understand them . night vale z oo director emily mutton told us that all animals prefer tiny cases and schedule food pellet consumption , and that it did not make sense that any animals would want to wander freely about town . she added a high-pitched roar , followed by a watery gurgling sound , and then our conversation was ended by repeated , cloudless thunderclaps . a reminder to anyone looking for fun on a budget today in night vale : it ' s free admission day at the night vale museum of forbidden technologies . as always , the museum features many fascinating permanent exhibits , including the cheap , pollution-free source of energy created by nikita tesla , multiple time machines ( some of them not yet invented ) , and pocket calculations ( which were outlawed by the city council 22 years ago for disclosed reasons ) . along with that , there is a temporary exhibit demonstrating the many exciting and extremely dangerous uses for layers . be sure to splurge on the guidebook at the museum store , as the exhibits themselves are entirely shrouded with thick burlap at all times , and all explanatory places have been black ed out with permanent marker . the museum of forbidden technologies . if you do not know about it , we may or may not have it ! and now a word from our sponsor : you come home . the lights are off . you get an uneasy feeling . suddenly , the phone rings . you remember that you do not have a phone . it rings some more . you do not know what to do . then you remember that , yes , you do own a phone . why would not you own a phone ? everyone owns a phone ! the phone is still ringing . ha ha ha ha ha ! how silly to think you did not own a phone . it rings again . you smile , and shrug , and answer the ringing phone . it is still dark . ` ` hello ? '' you say . ` ` they are waiting for you , '' a whisper , gender-indeterminate voice tells you . ` ` it is your time , '' it says . you turn on the light . you laugh again , wondering why it took you so long to turn on the light . ` ` gosh , it was dark !

'' that is the motto of a determined , unified community . and now , the weather ! ladies and gentlemen , good news ! mayor pamela mitchell called a press conference moments ago , declaring an end to our dog pack terror . the mayor announced that the dogs were not actually dogs , just some plastic bags caught in the breeze that people mistook for wild dogs . ` ` there are no wild dogs in night vale , '' she said . ` ` and if there were , they d be sweet little dogs with big , meaningless eyes and tongues like fly paper ! '' the plastic bags , meanwhile , have been safely returned to the dog park from whence they came , and which is to remain unknowable and remembered . journalists asked about the injuries and aftermath of this morning ' s dog pack related crimes ; the mayor responded with a hollow stare . she promptly shook the podium off its base and whispered through grit ted teeth , ` ` plastic bags . plastic bags . '' the sheriff ' s secret police then ethical ly settled the pool of reporter , gently coercing them with pepper spray . most were taken away peacefully in handcuffs and black hoods . thank goodness it was all a misunderstanding ! dear listeners , i do not want to say i told you so , but was not i right when i said we were a determined , resident little town ? in the face of wild beasts , we did not crumble , we did not back down . we stood eye to eye with violence , and it blinked first . stand proud , night vale ! be afraid on the inside , of course – you are , after all , your own downfall – but stand proud against those predator that would harm your family . and , that is our show ! thank you for listening , listeners ! stay tuned next for the popular advice program dr . brandon . this week , dr . brandon offers a step-by-step on how to remove your own appendix without surgery . the sky tonight is a soft , quivering green . the wind is calm , but prepared . get your sleep , night vale , and do not forget to dream . good night . today ' s proverb : eating meat is a difficult moral decision , because it ' s stolen , that meat . you should apologize .
WTNV|Wheat & Wheat By-Products|14 November 2012|today ' s air quality is maude and speckled . welcome to night vale . representatives from the greater medical insurance community announced this week that major insurance provides would no longer cover government-disseminated illnesses . these ailments were created to control undesirable populations and include : aids , most cancers , irritable bowel syndrome , telekinesis , tingling , and any kind of food allergy . doctors advise that the best way to avoid acquiring any of these conditions is to limit questionable public activities . try not to be in a lower economic class , and give regularly to an approved religious organization . take these precautions and you should live a healthy , or at least medically-insured , life . in other health news , the night vale council for commerce reminds you to regularly consume wheat and wheat by-products . by doing so , you are directly supporting the local night vale farmer , as well as the local night vale commodities conglomerates . looking for a snack ? try wheat , or a wheat by-product . dinner ? wheat and/or its by-product . trying to patch a leaky roof ? we have just the thing for you , and we also have its by-products . wheat and wheat by-products . by americans , for americans , in americans , watching americans . new information on the apache track er , who you might remember as that white guy who wears the cartoonishly inaccurate and offensive indian headdress , and who disappeared some weeks ago after investigation the strange occurrences at the night vale post office . well , word is in that he has reappeared , except it now seems he is actually native american . witnesses say his features are still recognizable , but during the disappearance he has transformed into that which he always absurdly claimed to be . more explanation , of course , is needed – but the apache track er is also now only able to speak russian , and i did not bother to get his statement translated . apparently , he has been taking to leaning on the hood of an old hon da accord in the parking lot of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , shaking his head slowly and checking his watch . does his complete racial transformation make his previous actions less offensive , listeners ? write us a letter telling us what you think , and then put it away in a drawer for ten years . reading it again , you ' ll get a little pang of nostalgia for the person you used to be , once upon a time . the city council today issued a strong warning against the manufacture and sale of discount bloodstones . they say that these bloodstones of inferior design and construction have the potential to cause major accidents in even common day-to-day chanting rituals . these accidents have included , in just the past few months : locus swarm , pus tornado es , and the creation and subsequent obliteration of a mirror version of night vale , forcing all of us to watch our identical counterpart perish – and thus confront the inevitability of our own future . anyone caught selling these bloodstones will be put into the dark box , pending era sure from recorded history . the lesser charge of buying or possessing them will be met with mere summary execution . critics charge that the city council is lying about all of this , due to the fact that the council owns the only certified blood stone factory in town . but , the council has vehemently denied this charge by jabbering , howling , and knocking over microphone . ... .. oh , dear . i apologize , listeners . we at night vale community radio are experiencing the following technical problems : the need for air , eye movement , and gooey stuff inside . please , stand by . ... .. thank you . these problems have been corrected . an update on our previous message about wheat and wheat by-products . you should not eat wheat or wheat by-products , say several frantic scientists , waving cupboards in our studio . as it turns out all wheat and wheat by-products , for unknown reasons , have turned into venomous snakes , which are crawling all over our small city , causing even more chaos than is normal . these snakes have been described as terrifying , loathsome , and ` ` probably from the bowels of hell itself ! '' – also , green and three feet long . if you have any wheat or wheat by-products in your home , you are almost certainly already dead . sorry about that . property taxes are going up again , night vale . several citizens are justifiable upset over this latest increase , but municipal services do , after all , cost money . schools , public transportation , parks and recreation facilities , and of course , the multi-billion dollar pulsar development facility . speaking of which , scientists say that they are on the verge of developing the first ever human-made neuron star . usually the aftermath of a supernova , this pulsar would be roughly four miles in diameter , but with a nearly incomprehensible density that makes it about half the mass of our own sun . and to think , this rapidly rotating sphere of radioactive matter will be right here under the sands of night vale , producing enough energy to power the earth for billions of years . the city of night vale plans to use the pulsar to light the high school football stadium , which still uses whale oil lamps . john peters – you know , the farmer – is particularly upset ... not only about the pulsar development , but also about the higher taxes . as owner of more than 150 acres , john will certainly have to pay a large share . and given that john is a pea ch farmer in a desert , he has not actually raised a successful crop ever . his only income is his half a million dollar annual subsidy for imaginary corn , which has been one of night vale ' s greatest exports . people come from all over – even desert bluff , unfortunately – to buy his imaginary corn . i like to butter up a piece of bread and then rub the imaginary corn along it , and then sprinkle it with a little bit of salt and cheyenne . boy , is that a delicious and low-carcinogen summer treat ! but even our town heroes like john peters – you know , the farmer – have to pay their fair share . no citizen is above paying taxes . well , except marcus vanston , but that ' s understandable because he ' s so wealthy . when you ' re worth as much as marcus vanston , you have proved your value to society through hard work and determination , and are no longer required to show anyone any further proof that you care about anything or anybody else , because you obviously do . look at all your money ! according to some , marcus is worth over five billion dollars , and that ' s five billion reasons marcus is our town ' s greatest citizen . further up dates on wheat and wheat by-products : the good news is that they are no longer poisonous serpent . the bad news is that they have transformed into a particularly evil and destructive form of spirit . please , be aware that wheat and wheat by-products are now malevolent and violent supernatural forces , capable of physically moving objects up to 200 pounds and entering human souls of up to soul strength four . the frantic scientists , who are now hopping up and down just outside my recording booth , indicating various charts and figures , recommend creating a simple lean-to out of animal bones and mud , such as you might have made and played in as a child , and hiding there until the spiritual forces of wheat and wheat by-products have passed . a reminder to all night vale citizens that the annual sorrow songs sing-along is this thursday . there will be a pluck lunch , and the football team will be selling refreshments to fund things that each of them individually want to buy for themselves . anyone who has their own sorrow song they d like to add to our communal vocal malaise should submit it to city hall by tuesday , at the latest . remember that low moans and minor-key ch ants do not count . the composer of the best sorrow song , as indicated by our audience participatory weep-o-meter , will be ritualistically drowned in a pool of our own townspeople ' s tears . good luck ! listeners , the city council , for national security reasons , have replaced the following report with the sound of a bubbling brook , followed by the sound of a running blend er . friends , listeners , there ' s a ... ... what it does . city comptrollers waynetta barnett received a $ 1.5 billion check from the federal government this week . the check was to support rebuilding efforts from this past week ' s massive earthquake , reaching 9.7 on the richer scale , the epi center of which was directly below night vale . of course , we experienced absolutely no damage to the town , and nobody reported feeling any effects at all from this enormous seismological event . comptrollers barnett says that she suspects that fera just saw the met er reading , declared this a disaster area , and sent a check . she does not think they have any interest in visiting night vale , so we can probably just spend the money however we want . barnett added that those new mi ni cooper sedan are really cut e , and wanted us all to look at their webster . we asked carlos about our inability to experience teutonic shifts . carlos , lovely carlos , had previously recorded other massive tremor activity underneath our city . his response was a few seconds of stammering followed by a sigh and slow head shake . his eyes were distant – distracted , yet beautiful . i asked him where he got his shirt . it fit him so well . he said he would look at his notes and computer models and see if he could figure out what was going on . i do not know if he listens to me sometimes . ladies and gentlemen , i take you from an unreal disaster to an un-unreal one . it is my sad duty now to announce that the city council is officially putting night vale under an emergency state , due to the on going and life-threatening wheat and wheat by-products situation . the council states that anyone who has come into contact with wheat and wheat by-products , and has by some happy miracle survived , should consider themselves infected and proceed to the usual quarante area , just behind the playground in mission grove park – there to spend the rest of their days in quiet contemplation and weaving . everyone else should head immediately to the wheat and wheat by-products shelter that has been sitting unused for decades under the public library . when asked why a wheat and wheat by-products shelter already existed , the city council answered , simply , ` ` prophecy . '' may you all be safe . may you all be well . may you be strong and flexible with ruddy cheeks and legs like tree trunks . and now , the weather . news from old woman josie , out near the car lot . she reports that the angels have gathered in a circle in her living room , blocking her view of the television . they are shoulder-to-shoulder , facing each other , radiant with holy light . ` ` the bowl ing alley , '' they are chanting . ` ` the bowl ing alley . '' she says that a repeat of the west wing she had really hoped to watch is on , and she is quite annoyed by her usually considerate angelic house guests . more on this story , maybe ... if there ever is more . and finally , some good news . all wheat and wheat by-products have mysteriously vanished from night vale , and the city council promises that they will be gone forever . this scourge , this siege upon us , this salve of food-based warfare is finally over . evermore will be we threatened in our homes by this enemy or its by-products . we also will never eat bread again , and that ' s a pretty big summer . but this is the balance that must be made between what we desire and what we fear , between pain and pleasure , between wheat , dear listeners , and its by-products . many of you are huddled now and forever in the quarante behind the playground in mission grove park . for this community-minded sacrifice , we thank you . i know you were forced there by martial law , but still , you should be commended for your brave action . terminal quarante might seem scary now , but i understand they have a well-stocked supply of canned lentils and the silver screen edition of trivial pursuit . and of course , you have the radio . i hope you will let my dulcet voice and our humble community station into your ears and hearts until your final wheat-loving breath . dear listeners , stay tuned next for a live broadcast of a man , locked in a recording booth , silently staring at the microphone with intense suspicion . and as always , since always , and for always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : today is the last day of your life up to this point .
WTNV|The Candidate|1 December 2012|the policeman in that intersect ion is not directing traffic . he ' s cod ing an urgent message to all of us . welcome to night vale . first , the news . old town night vale residents are complaining about extremely noisy sunset . several agitated citizens are pushing for the city council to do something about the solar shrieking every evening for the past few weeks . one homeowner described the sound as ` ` the parched cries of sad buzzards , or perhaps even the un holy voice of old scratch himself . '' the city council , speaking in unison at a televised press conference , said that the noise is just the windfall farms that litter the unfortunate wasteland of desert bluff , and that the noise do not fall under night vale jurisdiction . walt on invade , president of the community group soundproof old town , said that the windmills ca not possibly be the source of the noise , as they are non-existent and also do not work , because of desert bluff ' staggering incompetence . the city council called a second press conference , wherein they all wordlessly stared down invade for fourteen uninterrupted minutes . their dark eyes tore holes straight through the community spokesman ( metaphorically speaking ) , until his soul was compact ed into what looked like a partially chewed blackened pea ( literally ) . to date , only old town residents have reported hearing these inconceivable noise every evening as the sun crosses the indifferent horizon . and the noise seem to be taking their toll ; there have been two heart attacks , twelve cases of significant muscular atrophy , and at least two dozen claims of folks growing third eyes – including invade himself , who had an arachnid-like eight eyes when he spoke before city council yesterday morning . no other neighborhood can hear the sounds . i spoke to simone rigadeau in the earth sciences building at night vale community college about this scientifically fascinating story , and she called it a simple case of celestial just deserts . full disclosure , listeners : rigadeau does not work in earth sciences . she is a transient living in the re cycling closet of the earth sciences building , and she collects can s as pets . there is another hearing schedule at 4:00 am tomorrow , on the highest ledge overlooking skeleton gorge , which can only be accessed by government helicopter . all previous endeavors to scale the cliff-side by rock-climbing enthusiast have failed in extravagant gory fashion . the council issued a statement wishing inlaid luck in attending this mandatory meeting . breaking news : we ' ve received confirmation from the sheriff ' s secret police that fugitive hiram mcdaniels was finally apprehended . mcdaniels has been on the la m since august . he was wanted on several counts of insurance fraud , falsifying identification papers , evading arrest , and assailing a police vehicle with fire . mcdaniels was spotted near his earl road apartment early saturday morning by several alert neighbors . the neighbors said they were able to identify mcdaniels because he matched police sketches of an 18 foot tall five-headed dragon that had been posted across night vale . fingerprints later confirmed that mcdaniels was definitely a dragon . secret police are still un sure of mcdaniels ' motives for returning home . and , well , listeners , our station inter stacey just handed me a photo of hiram mcdaniels . he ' s a very dynamic-looking dragon . the raw power . the intensity in those five faces , those many sets of piercing blue and red and black and green and yellow eyes . i can certainly see how he charmed his way out of an arrest . he must never get tickets . what a guy ! an un signed press release i found under my pillow this morning announces the following : ` ` there is a free party this friday at the abandoned missile si lo outside of town . the purpose of this party is to celebrate ! there will be no sign , or music , but the party is inside the si lo . this party takes place at 3:00 am and will be over at 3:05. it will be dark , both inside and outside the si lo . grope blandly towards happiness . keep your mouth open and your teeth together to indicate you are at a party . you will hear noise , and later , you will not . this party will feature special guest b on jove , although he does not yet know it . see you there ! '' an interesting note on hiram mcdaniels : inter stacey tells me that she ' s been googling the roguish dragon . did you know that he has a b log ? he ' s a very smart fellow , some really groundbreaking ideas . here ' s one post from last week : ` ` if i were mayor of night vale , i would give incentive for small business development , and focus on youth physical fitness programs . human youth are the human future , after all . '' well , it seems a certain multi-headed fugitive wants to become mayor of night vale . you have my vote , hiram ! thursday night , the city council is voting on a new measure that would prohibit breathing as an involuntary muscular action . historically , the human body has been able to control breathing without the brain needing to consciously activate the diaphragm . under the new rule , all residents of night vale would be required to make the physical choice of whether or not – and when – to breathe . the city council said that we have too long taken the receipt of oxygen for granted , and that the sense of entitlement must cease . if the vote passes , residents will have until march 1 st of next year to learn to control these involuntary muscle groups during lucid sleep . detractors say that it is our constitutional right to breathe how we want , and that it is not the government ' s job to legislate breathing . the council responded by waving a brick in the air at reporter and shouting ` ` we learned to beat our own hearts ! we taught ourselves to wet our own corneas ! we have pulled ourselves up from nothing ! it is the american dream . '' then , they took a deep breath all together , lowered the brick , broke it into pieces , and devoured it . and now a word from our sponsor . we all want to live forever , right ? wrong . think about watching your family die as you selfish ly carry on , your children aging and passing , your grandchildren , and so on . think of all the friends you ' ll make , but eventually lose . you do not want that ! no ! you know the earth is eventually going to be swallowed by the sun , right ? and one day , you would be present for this greatest of all apocalypse . as fascinating as this would be , scientifically speaking , this excitement would fade as the pain of thousand-degree flames engulfed your tender body , and your aged mind would be so alone in this interminable torture . does this sound like something you want ? we did not think so . immortality is stupid . think before you wish . this message brought to you by direct to . dear listeners , right after we reported on hiram mcdaniels ' interest in becoming night vale mayor , the dirty campaign tactics came into play – stirring up bad feelings , and slinging the old municipal mud . incumbent mayor pamela mitchell issued a statement biting township by laws that prohibit prisoners from running for public office . now , is not it just like a career politician , such as mayor mitchell , to make such ethical , ad nominee attacks on a great reptilian beast , simply because he is in jail ? it sounds to me like the mayor is feeling mcdaniels breathing down her neck ! breathing dragon fire , that is . give ‘ em hell , hiram ! the following is a test of the emergency dream broadcast system . in the event of an actual emergency , you would just now be experiencing a dream in which you were in the neighborhood where you grew up , only all the houses are now black , featureless cylinders . just row after row of these blank dark cylinders , stretching out around you . you are home ... but you are also somewhere from whence you will never find home again . there is someone waiting for you at the end of the longest street . you know that , although you do not know who . you try to run down the street and it grows longer and longer . you pass by one cylinder in particular and know that it ' s your house . you stop running . you approach the blank face of the cylinder , its surface seeming to devour light and sound . you reach out and you are inches from touching it . just then you hear a din g . you look up to see words in the sky . possible flash floods , they say . alert valid until 3:00 pm . once again , this has been a test of the emergency dream broadcast system . the night vale mall is having to deal with angry calls from parents , after the santa they hired for christmas photo was once again a no-show . mall public relations officials said that the missing santa is actually a performance art piece , meant to show people how our capitalist idol are truly nonexistent , ghosts of materialistic ideas that we have embraced as replacement for true spiritual meaning . a long line of upset parents and crying children stretched from santa ' s empty chair to just past the hollister . the mall or officials added that they have a really cool idea for valentine ' s day . they ' re thinking , like , moving pictures of actual beating hearts projected onto a large teddy bear ? which has been stretched open like a vivisected frog from seventh grade life science ? officials added , ` ` it ' s going to be monstrous and beautiful . you do not even know what art really is . you do not even know yourself . '' they concluded by chanting and pump ing their arms in unison , like a lower , paleolithic version of the ma dance . and now ... the weather . during the break , i received a message from mayor mitchell ' s office responding to our previous reports . according to the mayor , mayor al elections are not for another three years , and hiram mcdaniels is ineligible to run – not only because of his jail stay , but also because he is neither a night vale resident , nor a human being . there is , she says , no precedent for a five-headed dragon as elected official . mayor mitchell also pointed out that writing the throwaway phrase ` ` if i were mayor of night vale '' on a b log is not an official declaration of candidacy . ` ` there is paperwork ! '' mayor mitchell shouted into my voicemail . ` ` you ca not just ... arch ! '' she continued , trailing off slightly at the end . what followed was about ninety-five seconds of loud stomping , and what sounded like wood chopping in the distance , before the message finally ended . allow me a retort , dear listeners , with this brief editorial : with all due respect , madame mayor , have we not had enough dragon-bashing ? our great country once held to some terrible old customs , but we grew up . we learned . we abolished slavery . women won the right to vote . ghosts can now marry ( but of course , not have children – i mean , that would be a real slippery slope ) . and our own little burg is on the verge of becoming the first city in this great nation to legalized time travel . so let ' s loose our collars ! let ' s march into the reptilian future , not cling to the narrow past . just because a dragon is a dragon , and has five heads , does not mean he ca not lead our community . sure , critics will say , ` ` oh ! but cecil ! what if his five heads do not agree on something ? what if one ' s like , ‘ yeah , let ' s build this school ! ' but another ' s like , ' no more schools ! ' and the others are drunk or sleepy or something ? how can we agree to elect five heads that ca not agree with themselves ?
WTNV|A Story About You.|15 December 2012|` ` this is a story about you , '' said the man on the radio . and you were pleased , because you always wanted to hear about yourself on the radio . welcome to night vale . this is a story about you . you live in a trailer , out near the car lot , next to old woman josie ' s house . occasionally , she ' ll wave at you on her way out to get the mail or more snacks for the angels . occasionally , you ' ll wave back . you ' re not a terrible neighbor , as far as it goes . at night , you can see the red light blinking on and off on top of the radio tower . a tiny flurry of human activity against the implacable backdrop of stars and void . you ' ll sit out on the steps of your trailer , with your back to the brightness of the car lot , watching the radio tower for hours . but only sometimes . mostly , you do other things . this story is about you . you did not always live in night vale . you lived somewhere else , where there were more trees , more water . you wrote direct mail campaigns for companies , selling their products . ` ` dear resident , '' you wrote often . ` ` finally , some good news in this dreary world ! at last , a reason not to kill yourself ! '' then you would delete that and write something else , and it would be sent out , and it would not be read by anyone . you had a friend , and then a girlfriend , and then a fiancee – the same person . she cooked dinner sometimes , but sometimes you cooked . you often touched . one day you were walking from the glass box of your office to your old ford probe , and a vision came to you . you saw above you a planet , of awe some size , lit by no sun . an invisible tit an , all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep turbulent ocean . it was so far away . so desolate . and so impossible , terrifying dark . and that day , you did not go home . you drove instead . you drove a long time , and eventually you ended up in night vale , and you stopped driving . you have been haunted ever since by how easy it was to walk away from your life , and how few the repercussions were . you never heard from your fiancee or your job again . they never looked for you , which does not seem likely , or maybe it ' s that in night vale , you can not be found . the complete freedom . the lack of consequence . it terrified you . you have a new job now . every day except sunday you drive out into the sand wastes , and there you find two truck s . you move wooden crates from one truck to another while a man in a suit silently watches . it is a different man each time . sometimes the crates tick . mostly , they do not . when you are done , the man in the suit hands you an amount of cash , also different each time , and you go home . it is the best job you ' ve ever had . except , today ... it was different . you moved the crates . the man in the suit , a stranger , watched . but then , as had never happened before , the man in the suit received a phone call . he walked off at some distance to take it . ` ` yes , sir ! '' he said , and ` ` no , sir ! '' also he made hawk shrieking sounds . it was not terribly interesting . you moved crates . but then , an impulse ... an awful impulse came over you , and for no other reason than that you are trapped by the freedom to do anything in this life , you took one of the crates , and put it in your trunk . by the time the man came back from his phone call , you were done with your job . he gave you the money ( it was nearly five hundred dollars today , the second highest it had ever been ) , and you drove home with the crate in your trunk . when you got home , you took the crate into your trailer and left it in the kitchen . the crate did not make a ticking sound . it made no sound at all . nothing made a sound except you , breathing in and breathing out . you cooked dinner ( you always cooked dinner ) , the red light on the tower blinked on and off in your peripheral vision , a message that was there and then was not , and that you could never quite read . you wondered how long it would take them to miss the crate . you did not wonder who ‘ they ' were . some mysteries are not questions to be answered , but just the kind of opaque fact – a thing which exists to be not known . which brings us to now . to this story . this story about you . you are listening to the radio . the announced is talking about you . and then you hear something else , a guttural howl out of the desert distance , and you know that the crate ' s absence has been discovered . the crate – well , it sits , that ' s all . on the kitchen floor . that ' s all . it ' s warm , warmer than the air around it . it smells sharp and earthy , like freshly ground cinnamon . and when you put your ear against the rough warm wood , you hear a soft humming – an indistinct melody . it does not appear to be difficult to open . all you would need to do is remove a few nails . you do not open it . you decide , instead , to go to the moonlite all-nite din er , and have a slice of pie . the wind is hot , like always , and smells like honey and mud . night is your favorite time . daylight brings only a chain of visual sensations , none of which chere into meaning for you anymore . life has become out of focus , free of consequence . as you drive you turn off the headlights , for a moment . at that moment , you feel again , above you , not even far away now , that planet of awe some size , lit by no sun . an invisible tit an , all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep , turbulent ocean . you see nothing but the faint moonlight on your dashboard , but you know the planet is out there – yawning in the unseen spaces . the moment passes . you turn your headlights back on , and all you see is a road . just shalt . just that . and you pass a man waving seashore flags indicating that the speed limit for this stretch is 45. the moonlite all-nite is radiant green ; a slab of mint light in the warm darkness . you squint when you see it , like it hurts your eyes , but it does not hurt your eyes . you park near the front door . a man rolls by on the ground , his eyes bleary and rightless , whispering the word ` ` mud womb '' over and over . but you do not have the money to tip him , so you go inside . you order a slice of strawberry pie , and the witness indicates through words and movements that it will be brought to you presently . the radio speaks soothingly to you from static speakers set into a foam tile ceiling . it is telling a story about you . your story , at last . a man slid es into the booth across from you . you recognize him vaguely , although he looks considerably different now . it is that man who appeared to be of slavic origin , but who dressed in an absurd caricature of an indian chief and called himself the apache track er . except now , it ' s difficult for you to miss , he has actually transformed into a native american . you wonder if the pie will get there soon . the apache track er smells of pott ing soil and sweat . he means across the table and touches your hand lightly . you do not pull the hand away , because you know that there will be no consequence for any of this . ` ` вы в опасности , '' ( 1 ) he says , ` ` они идут . '' ( 2 ) you nod . he tap s the table . then , bringing his thick eyebrows together and pursing his lips , he means down and tap s the ground . you nod again . ` ` i think my pie is here now , '' you say unnecessarily , as the pie is quite visibly placed in front of you . you did not order invisible pie . you hate invisible pie . he looks at the pie for a long time , and then lets his breath hiss out slowly through his nose . ` ` они придут снизу . пироги не помогут . '' ( 3 ) he leaves . what an ashore that guy is ! you finish the pie and ask for the check . ` ` check please , '' you say , whispering it into your drinking glass as is custom , and then lifting the tray of sugar packets to find it , filled out and ready to be paid . you drop a few dollars onto the check , place it back under the sugar , wait for the sound of swallowing , and leave the din er . the witness nods as you leave , but not at you . she nods slowly and rhythmically to music only she can hear , her eyes riding the curved line of ne on lights above the menu . as you start the car , the man on the radio says something about the weather . the crate is in your kitchen , where you left it , and you get down on your knees to embrace it more fully . it has grown warmer – even hot . it still is not ticking . it had taken you no time to get back home . now that you think about it , were there any other cars on the road ? where did all the cars go ? the man with the seashore flags explaining the speed limit – he was not there either . your heart pounds . without allowing another stray thought to wander through your mind and delay you , you grab the crate and throw it in your trunk . you turn the ignition , and your car radio comes alive with a pop – just as the announced says that your car radio comes alive with a pop . where to now ? you do not know , but you go there anyway . a pair of headlights , a pair of eyes , and two shaky hands , speeding through the silent town . behind you , you see helicopter searchlights sweeping down onto your trailer . there are sirens . a purplish cloud hangs over the town , glittering occasionally as it rotated . the whole works . you drive past the moonlite all-nite – still aglow and full of people slowly eating what sounds good only late at night , and teddy williams ' desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex – which has taken to not only locking but barricading its doors at closing time . you pass by city hall which , as always , is completely shrouded after dark in black velvet . moving farther out , following the pull of the distant , uncertain moon , you pass by the car lot ( where the salesman have been put away for the night ) , and old woman josie ' s house ( where the only sign that the assuming little home could be a place of residence for angels is the bright halo of heavenly light surrounding it , and the sign out front that says angels ' residence ) . and the town is behind you , and you are out in the scrub lands , and the sand wastes . by the road you see a man , holding a cactus in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other . he shakes both at you as you pass , and howls . and then , you are alone . just you , and the desert . you stop the car and get out . pebbles crutch in the sand in response to your movement . the radio murmurs behind the closed doors of the car . the headlights illuminate only a few stray plants , and the wide dumb eyes of some nocturnal animal . looking back , you see the bulge of light that is your night vale . the purple cloud , now floating over the heart of the city , reaches its tendrils in and out of buildings . you hear screams , and bonfire . you open the trunk and lay one hand on the crate . it pulses with some kind of life . still no ticking though . you look back . several buildings are on fire . crowds of people are floating in the air , held aloft by beams of light , and struggling feebly against power they can not begin to understand . the ground shifts , like it was startled . it ' s so quiet , when it finally comes . you see the black car long before it arrives . it comes to a halt nearby and two men step out . you do not run . neither do they . ` ` how did you find me ? '' you ask . ` ` everything you do is being broadcast on the radio for some reason . that made it pretty easy , '' says one of the men , the one that is not tall . ` ` yeah , '' you say . ` ` i see that now . '' ` ` you have the item ? '' the man who is not tall asks . you say nothing . the man who is not tall signals the man who is not short , and he walks past you , looks into your trunk , and nods . ` ` even easier , '' says the man who is not tall . there is an unexpected click . one of the rear doors of the black car has opened , and your fiancee has stepped out . her eyes are wet , like it was the night you left . she does not appear to have aged , but then , you ca not actually remember how long it has been . could it have been last week ? or was it ten years ago ? ` ` why ? '' she says . ` ` why ? why ? '' you do not know what to say . the man who is not short steps up to you , puts a knife against your throat . nobody says anything . your fiancee shakes her head . her eyes are empty . broken . gushing . the radio is saying all of this as it happens . you hear it dimly through the car door . you ca not stop smiling . all at once , the consequences . all at once you are no longer free . it ' s all coming back around . all at once . life – bleary , washed-out – snap back into focus . the red light on the tower still blinks in the distance and every message in this world has a meaning . it all makes sense and you are finally being punished . you ca not think of a time you have ever been happier . your fiancee abruptly gets back into the car . neither of the men seem to notice her . one opens the crate with a couple quick tap s , and pulls out of it an intricate miniature house . the hours that must have been spent building it ! every detail is accounted for ! inside the house you think you see for a moment , lights and movement . ` ` damaged , '' says the man who is not tall . you beam at him . the knife presses harder against your throat , but it does not hurt . your eyes wander up and you see above you the dark planet of awe some size perched in its unless void , an invisible tit an all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep , turbulent ocean . a monster . spinning . soundless . forgotten . it ' s so close now . you see it just above you . maybe even if you tried very hard , you could touch it . you reach up ... this has been your story . the radio moves onto other things – news , traffic , political opinions , and corrections to political opinions . but there was time , one day , one single day , in which it was only one story . a story about you . and you were pleased , because you always wanted to hear about yourself on the radio . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : i d never join a pen 15 club that would allow a person like me to become a member . translations : ( 1 ) you are in danger .

WTNV|The Man in the Tan Jacket|1 January 2013|look to the obelisk . we do not know where it came from , but it ' s attracting a lot of cats . welcome to night vale . happy new year , night vale ! last night ' s fireworks extravaganza at the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area was beautiful ! this is despite the fact that the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area never really existed , and was in no way a multi-million dollar failure of municipal planning . and just because the only things remaining on the premises are several large piles of rubble and a red sign reading ` ` nothing is here . nothing was ever here '' does not mean that they failed to correctly use tax dollars to build a harbor , a waterfront , or a recreation area . anyway , the fireworks over the city-made sign were lovely . happy 2013 ! ladies and gentlemen , surely you have noticed ... there ' s a man in a ta n jacket . countless residents have seen him , but no one can seem to remember exactly what he looks like ; just that he has a ta n jacket and a bearskin suitcase , and he has been spotted all over town . but no one can quite recall specifically where they saw him , or what time of day it was . just that they saw him . frances donelson – the tall woman with the green eyes who manages the antique mall – thinks maybe the man in the ta n jacket is simply a shared dream . but i know i saw him , night vale . i know what i saw . this man could not possibly be a dream . he was so vivid . his eyes were ... well , his nose and his chin ... oh , i can just see ! i just ca not remember ! the man was clear as day ! he had a ta n jacket , and a bearskin suitcase . he ca not be a dream , can he ? please , call in , listeners , and let us know if you can remember anything else . this monday through friday is the annual night vale career fair at the downtown convention center . there will be dozens of booths , representing phony local business es that will take your resumes and photo ( via hidden surveillance camera ) and conduct sample interviews designed to badge you into implicating yourself in nefarious activities . first-generation night vale residents – particularly those whose parents were originally born in maine , massachusetts , canada , micronesia , and surname – are strongly encouraged to attend . this year ' s key note speaker is an audit tape of droning moans leaden with subliminal tips about achieving personal prosperity and how to come clean about the terrible things you have done , you cret in . last year ' s fair features several very high-profile arrests , and exciting door prizes . tickets are $ 25 – or $ 15 if you still have working retina to scan . over the weekend , teddy williams – owner of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex – sent us some security camera foot age of what he believes to be the first-ever glimpse of citizens of the underground city deep below lane five . early saturday morning , fun complex camera picked up flurry motion near the soda machine . the foot age is quite fuzzy and difficult to discern . perhaps it is merely rats or raccoons , digging through an uncovered supply of junk food . but it is , of course , much more likely that a lost nation of people , living in the bowels of a small-town bowl ing alley , are finally revealing themselves , taking our food supplies , and preparing for war . teddy told us that he believes this city to be thousands strong and ready to move into night vale . ready to take arms against the ` ` upper world '' ( as they probably call us ) . ready to conquer this heaven and become the righteous owners of our sun-soaked precious land ... we assume . it takes very little extrapolation to believe that they worship a god named huntokhar , who demands sacrifice to keep their underground city thriving in the absence of nourishing sunlight . and a fair assumption is they are ruled by a child king , recently pronated , who is too weak to rein back the generals intent on marching upon us in war . ladies and gentlemen , if you care for your community , your town , your night vale like i do , you will arm yourselves . you will rally your neighbors to militia . you will point fingers at those who do not wish to fight and have them rounded up into pens . this is no time for the weak . we are at a presumptive war with a projected enemy whom we can not yet see , or even be certain of , but who are probably bloodthirsty giants . if you would like to learn more about starting a militia , simply learn to be a true american . that ' s how you ' ll know . and remember , night vale is at war . your careless talk costs lives . they know we are here , and it seems somebody talked . who was it , night vale ? was it steve carlsberg ? did steve carlsberg talk ? maybe a group of good citizens should go have a ` ` chat '' with steve and find out what he ' s been saying , and to whom . stay by your radius , listeners . we will report further as events warrant . more now on the man in the ta n jacket . old woman josie called to tell us that her angel friends are saying that the bearskin suitcase is full of flies . the angels would not tell her more , explaining that knowing more would jeopardized her eternal soul , as well as their own status es as angels . they did not want to mess with that ! old woman josie added that she thinks the man in the ta n jacket is just a salesman of some sort . a fly salesman , she bets , wandering from town to town with polished shoes and a suitcase full of flies . ` ` oh , i just ca not stand those fly salesman , '' she said . ` ` ringing my doorbell at 3:00 am , wanting to show me samples and asking for glasses of orange milk ! '' the night vale daily journal has announced that , despite cost-cutting measures and mandatory subscription laws , it is facing a huge budget shortfall this year . ` ` we can not pay back our printers , or our delivery crews , '' said editor leann hart , in a prepared statement whispered through my mail slot late last night . ` ` and we have already had to banish much of our staff into the sand wastes of the desert . '' she went on to explain that this ` ` budget shortfall '' has nothing to do with the reported lavish birthday party she threw for herself in night vale stadium , featuring a lazy river made entirely of champagne and a birthday cake topped with very thin slices of moon rock . in an addendum she tapped in morse code on my bathroom window , she said that the journal is considering all new sources of income – including creating additional advertising space and mugging night vale citizens , and that i should not mention the whole birthday party thing after all , because she was never even born , so how could she have had a birthday party ? she spent the rest of the night tapping out the phrase ` ` birthdays are a fake idea , '' which actually was a pretty relaxing sound to fall asleep to . hey , kid s and parents ! time once again for our children ' s fun fact science corner ! today we are exploring common birds and their meanings . an eagle indicates that an important phone call is impending . a sparrow says that you should beware the sea , and sell any stocks invested in food-based companies . a pigeon means that your mother has died – or that all is well . it ' s a bit uncertain . a hummingbird tells us that the physical constant of the universe are slowly degrading and may someday shift , invalidating the laws of physics and instantly wiping out the universe as we know it while simultaneously creating an entirely new universe in a single transcendent moment of genocide and genesis . as for hawk , well ... no one knows what hawk mean , or if they are real . have you ever even seen a hawk ? of course not . no one has . this has been our children ' s fun fact science corner . and now a word from our sponsors . today ' s program has been sponsored by the physical act of gulp ing . for thousands of years , gulp ing has been there for human beings when they needed an expressive gesture of the throat . whether you want to indicate nervousness about an up coming test or appointment , fear of the careless old woman who lives secretly in your home , or just want to ingest milk faster than with regular swallowing , gulp ing is the way to go . forget sweating ! never mind shivering ! sneering ? ugh ! when you think physical actions , think gulp ing ! gulp now and receive a complimentary prize package , which will be conveniently buried in an unmarred spot somewhere in the scrublands . find it , and it ' s yours ! gulp ! this just in : the sheriff ' s secret police has just issued an important request related to our earlier story . they ask that all night vale citizens be on the lookout for a man in a ta n jacket , carrying a bearskin suitcase . he is about five or six foot something , probably with hair , and normal human features . he was last seen early this morning on the un lit , gravel-paved stretch of oak trail , near larry le roy ' s house out on the edge of town . the man in the ta n jacket was reportedly seen in the moonless black , standing next to a refrigerator engulfed in flames . he was smoking a cigarette . witnesses claimed he stared at them as they slowly drove by on the darkened country road , but despite the prolonged eye contact , the witnesses still could not describe his face to police . two days prior , the man in the ta n jacket was seen standing in a park . no one can remember which park , but they ' re fairly certain it was a park . or , maybe , it was in the old navy outlet store or near the invisible clock tower ... it was not quite clear . either way , the man was definitely standing with his bearskin suitcase , and staring up at the sun for hours . he followed the bizarre glowing orb , which is somehow the source of all light and life , and – ` ` oh god , the sun , are you bidding us with this thing ? we do not even have time for that mystery ! '' the secret police then interjected . secret police officials added that if you see a man in a ta n jacket carrying a bearskin suitcase , write down what you see immediately . the city council has temporarily lifted their ban on pens and pencils , so that citizens can help law enforcement on this matter . once you write down your encounter , call 911 immediately , or simply say , ` ` hey , police ! '' out loud . we ' re all being monitor almost 24/7 , so they ' ll probably hear you just fine . let ' s go now to traffic . there is a car . it ' s not in night vale , or even in the desert that cradle our little town . it ' s out somewhere beyond that . there are many cars there , but i 'm speaking only about one . blue , square-ish , with tires and windows and an engine that works ... most of the time . a woman is driving it , and she is also glancing whenever she can at the child in the passenger seat . he is a child , but he is 15. you understand . she is glancing at him , but she is not saying anything . and he is not saying anything either . she wants to cry ... ... or , she wants to push him out of the car ... ... or , she wants to go back in time and insist on using a cond om ... ... only she would never do that . she would not change any of this , really . not for all the money – piles of money , some of it defect money from defect and absent governments – she would not give any of this back . so she drives her car . blue . square-ish . with tires , and windows , and an engine that works ... most of the time . and she glances at the 15 year-old child . and neither of them speaks . this has been traffic . and now , the weather . ladies and gentlemen : during the break , i received a call from someone claiming to be an angel . now , i do not know if this was a prank or not , as no one has ever actually proven that they ' ve talked to an angel . even old woman josie ' s word is just that , her word . but listeners , i think this had to have been an angel , because my face became hot , and the voice filled every part of my body , and tears were flowing down my face the instant i touched the phone receiver , and the whole room was lit up in – well , how can i describe this ? – a bright black beam illuminating every atomic detail ! and the angel – if that is indeed who called – the angel said that the man in the ta n jacket with the bearskin suitcase was from a place underneath the earth . underneath our knowledge . a vast world , right below our feet . i asked for more , but the angel – if that is indeed who called – whispered only , ` ` a flower in the desert . '' and it filled me with ecstasy and dread . then the call ended , and the black ray of truth was gone , and i was breathless and alone . and dear listeners , the silence ... well , it was unlike any silence you have ever not heard . so our mystery man remains un-found . and i 'm still not sure why an angel would have to use a telephone . but , for now , we can only know what we know . and that is that we do not know . thank you again for listening , listeners . i look forward to another fine year . a new year , well-spent with all of you out there . stay tuned next for two commercial-free hours of e♯ . good night , night vale . be alert , and write down everything you can not comprehend . until next time . today ' s proverb : biological speaking , we are all people , made up of smaller people .
WTNV|Street Cleaning Day|15 January 2013|banana are hardly that slippery . but watch your step anyway . welcome to night vale . ladies , gentlemen , you . today is street cleaning day . please remain calm ! street cleaner will be upon us quite soon . we have little time to prepare . please remain calm ! the city council has issued a statement in 20-point all-caps type saying : run ! run ! forget your children and leave behind the weak ! run ! we have contracted those experts who have not already gone underground or changed their identity , and have been told that street cleaner focus on heat and movement , and so the best strategy is to be dead already . then the experts all swallowed pills and fell , mouths fro thing , at my feet . if you have doors , lock them . if you have windows , board them up . if you still have ears , cover them , and crouch wherever you are . it is street cleaning day . please remain calm ! john peters – you know , the farmer ? he reports finding an old oak door standing supported by any other structure out in the scrublands . he says he ' s sure it was not there yesterday ... or pretty sure , anyway . as sure as he can be since the accident . apparently there is knocking from the door , as if there were someone from some other side that does not exist in our narrow , fragile reality trying to get in . he has added several deadbolts and chains to the door on both sides , un sure which direction the door opens . which is , by the way , a huge design flaw . one should always know which way a door opens merely by looking at it if the designer has done their job . and this holds true whether it ' s a bank of glass doors at the mall , or an unspeakably old wooden door leading to other worlds than these . john , meanwhile , says he will keep a sleepless vigil upon the door , as any sleep merely leads to dreams of flurry shapes in the dim distance , advancing , hissing , upon this vulnerable planet . he also says the imaginary corn is coming in real good , and we should have a nice crop to choose from soon , especially now that it will be available for sale at the green market . the staff at dark owl records announced today that they are only listening to , selling , and talking about bud dy holly . if you want to buy music at all , you had better like bud dy holly . if you dress like bud dy holly , that ' s cool too . they also announced that bud dy holly will be performing live there this saturday night at 11:00 to promote his newest album , which is called ` ` i 'm trapped in between worlds , existing only in the form that you knew me . this is not who i am . leave me alone and just let me die , please ! '' organized crime is on the rise , night vale . the sheriff ' s secret police and the night vale council for commerce are cracking down on illegal wheat and wheat by-product speakeasies . two months ago , the city council abolished forever all wheat and wheat by-products . but a black market appears to have formed for those depraved addicts who ca not get enough wheat , nor its by-products . big rico ' s pizza was cited this week for ho sting an illegal wheat and wheat by-products joint in a hidden basement space . big rico ' s , in light of the new laws , has had to alter its menu to mostly just bowls of stew ed tomato es , melted cheese wad s , and gluten-free pizza slices . his forefront seemed to be the model of a wheat-free and wheat by-product-free society . but even the most honest business es can turn to crime when their livelihood is on the line . fortunately for big rico he is a very nice person , and apologized to the city council in a way that did not include blackmailed , or secret campaign contributions , or special favors . big rico is just truly sorry for what he has done . the sheriff ' s secret police say that they are cupping their efforts to stop these illicit wheat and wheat by-product manufacturers . they are mostly just sniffing in the air until they smell bread . ` ` it ' s pretty easy , actually , '' the sheriff said from his hover-office in the clouds . more information now on street cleaning day , which has come upon us just as we always feared it would . the information is that street cleaning day is terrifying , and that we should all perhaps fall to our knees , letting out moans and rubbing our forearms absently . the city council has issued a statement indicating that they forgot they had vacation plans this week , and so are currently on a plane to mimi – as they had been planning and looking forward to for some time . they said their vacation , since it was definitely planned , has a reestablished end date , but that they can not tell anyone what that end date is until the street cleaner are completely gone . in the meantime they are leaving paul birmingham in charge . paul , the vagrant who lives in a lean-to behind the library , could not be reached for comment – as he has faked his own death in an elaborate scheme to escape street cleaning day unsheathed . more , if there ever is more for any of us . and now a word from our sponsors . today ' s broadcast is sponsored by target . target is a great place to shop , and they would like you to consider the variety of silence in this world . the deathly silence when an argument has reached a height from which neither party can see a safe way down . and the soft wet silence of post-coital breath-catching . silence in a courtroom moments before a man ' s life is changed completely by something so insignificant as his past . and the silence of a hospital room as a man , in front of everyone he loves , lets the heat from his clenched hands dissipated into the background hum of the universe . the quiet of outdoor distances . of wilderness . of the luxury of space . and the quiet of dead air on the radio . the sound of a mistake . of emphasis . of your own thoughts when you expected someone else ' s . shop at target . from time to time , listeners , i like to bring a little education to our show . throw out some interesting facts or ` ` mind fuel .

WTNV|The Phone Call|1 February 2013|your existence is not impossible , but it ' s also not very likely . welcome to night vale . in light of the ever-declining sales of newspapers , and the rise of competition from digital media , the night vale daily journal announced that it has developed a new business model . publishing editor leann hart , speaking to television and internet reporter outside the burned-down shell of the journal ' s former distribution plant , said their new mission , as a newspaper , is to kill news baggers with hatchet . in this bold new initiative – a game-changing strategy by one of the industry stalwart – the daily journal plans to just go to baggers ' homes and places of employment ( with hatchet ) and then chop them up ( the baggers ) until they ( the baggers ) are dead . she added that the journal still plans to use the a p style guide and they are working to design a newer , more modern-looking mast head . several journal reporter and ad rep then began swinging blades at the non-print reporter in attendance . the sheriff ' s secret police is issuing an urgent message to all citizens : attention all citizens : memories this list . memories it now . it will not now , nor ever , be repeated . memories this list for your safety and protection . we can not tell you when or where you will need to know it but when you do , you will be safe . here is the list . memories . now . hazel nut mystify cuttlefish lark lurk robert anglican pheromone halt er top marmalade hardware laser pepper release knee cap falafel period chase chaste leggings wool sweat er heartfelt heartfelt heart beat heart beat beat beat beat beat memories that list , citizens , in order . secret police warn that if you miss even one word , or transport a couple of worlds like ` ` lurk '' and ` ` lark , '' there could be unpleasant consequences . this has been a special announcement from the sheriff ' s secret police . listeners , guess who called me this weekend . well , hey , i do not like to talk too much about my personal life here . this is your community news station , not cecil ' s personal life station , right ? okay , fine . i ' ll just say it : ♫ carlos ! ♫ carlos , the dark , delicate-skinned scientist who came into our little town and our little hearts several months ago . well , i gave him my home phone number quite a while back , and he never called , and i did not think anything of it , right ? i mean , sometimes people just do not call , and that ' s okay . well , to the point : carlos calls , and i ' m like , ` ` hello ?

WTNV|Valentine|15 February 2013|trust everyone . welcome to night vale . hello , citizens of night vale . i bring you now to our on going coverage of the valentine ' s day aftermath . emergency workers have been at it since early this morning , starting the long task of clean up and recovery . reports are still hay , but we believe that the housing developments of marshall ' s gorge and golden dun es have both been wiped completely off the map , while coyote corners and cactus bloom are reporting extensive damage to structures and power lines . please , if you are not directly involved in the recovery and clean up from valentine ' s day , stay off the roads to make room for those who are . this valentine ' s day , as all valentine ' s days , will not succeed in bringing our city down . this valentine ' s day , as all valentine ' s days , will soon recede into painful memory , fading with time , until another foul valentine ' s day is upon us again . in other news , the ran dy new man memorial night vale airport has announced some schedule changes due to multiple severe weather conditions , including the existence of an atmosphere , and that strange fiery orb that appears for approximately half of every twenty-four hour period . many of today ' s flights will be delayed for several hours while the rest will be moved into the past and will have already happened last week . all arriving flights have been canceled except those from of , lax , and x ta , which will continue on the usual routine of unscheduled arrivals that are a complete surprise to both the pilots and air traffic control – based on routes that appear to violate the simple laws of physics and geography . in addition , martin mccaffrey – local t sa representative – reminded all travelers that security measures are in place for their own safety , and we should respect the sacrifice needed to keep our lives and our country secure . martin said , ` ` i know going through both a metal and full-body scanned , as well as crawling through a lengthy pitch-black tunnel while a recording of a monotony male voice lists possible ways of dying are all inconvenience , and i know that many travelers are concerned with privacy issues involving the voice of a small child that comes through strategically placed ceiling g rates asking them to name every person they have ever kissed . but these are all necessary evils . '' mister mccaffrey then went on to draw a quick sketch of a strange , elongated , dark figure crawling out of a kitchen refrigerator – after which he immediately insisted he had no memory of creating the picture and no idea what it could mean . more on this ... eventually . probably . hey , here ' s a health tip from the greater night vale medical community ! it ' s possible you wo not be able to kill it . if it manages to burrow under your skin , stop fighting , because it has already become part of you . welcome your new body mate ! listen to what it has to say . and see where the new symbiotic lifestyle takes you ! emergency workers report that the damage from valentine ' s day is worse than previously projected . they describe bodies strewn upon the ground , covered in glitter and paper cupids . entire buildings collapsed , leaving only rubble and chalky candy hearts . and , of course , there is the sad fate of those chosen to be another person ' s valentine . little can be said to help the families of those unfortunates except that the process is , while exactly as ghastly and excruciating as feared , apparently not as horribly slow and drawn out as it appears to outside observers . as usual , no aid has come our way from either the state or national government . the state house even went so far as to send a formal reply , the entirety of which reads : ` ` sorry ... we can see what you were going for , but maybe we just do not ‘ get ' that kind of thing . anyway , creative stuff ! and have a happy valentine ' s ! '' those monsters ! if you or anyone you know has any foot age or photo of the events of valentine ' s day , please send them directly into the station so that we may put the images and video on the radio . thank you , and be safe . the city council recently moved to name ` ` dance '' as the official town language . this measure has been met with tense debate and raised voices over the past several weeks . opponents say we need a unified language , as it will save money on municipal sign age and documentation – not to mention bring us together as a community . ` ` the poetry of the human body , '' they said , while quickly pulling in their elbows and turning their bowler hats down over their eyes in an obvious tribute to bob fosse , ` ` mates physical being with mental necessity ; a marriage that brings purpose to our quickly rotting living corpses . '' opponents say that this move , if voted into law , is discriminatory against the physically handicapped . also , less than 10 % of night vale citizens have ever taken a single dance lesson – let alone achieved sidelong mastery of one of the most eternal and difficult-to-grasp art forms . one opponent , who asked to remain name less out of fear of retribution , told us the bill was entirely funded by lobbyists from cheryl ' s little princesses dance studio . ` ` just follow the money , '' they said . then the anonymous insider ' s pupils grew until they eclipsed the whites . their tongue slid out from their knife gash of a grin , and their hair would not stop gray ing and growing . a final vote is expected on tuesday . and now , traffic . a representative from the sheriff ' s secret police , waving vaguely at a map in our studio , said that there are street closure , quote ` ` all over . just all over the general area , '' the representative said , tapping the edge of the map with two knuckles . ` ` a bunch of ' em , in ... different places . '' we asked if he could be more specific , and he nodded , but did not say anything more . we tried naming a couple of streets to see if any of them were included on the list of closure , but the representative only replied with a , ` ` oh , yeah , i mean ... probably ! '' and an ambiguous head waggled to each one . he added that anyone caught on a closed road would be dealt with in the usual manner , and then he winked and gave me a thumbs-up . it is possible he was merely a vagrant who wandered into the studio . we did not bother to check his credentials . just to be safe , though , look out for road closure all over in the general area , listeners . they ' re in a bunch of different places ... probably . this has been traffic . and now for corrections . we offer the following corrections to previous reports broadcast on night vale community radio . blue , not green . a low whirring sound was heard only by those to the west of it . the witness ' name was henry greggson and not , as we reported , crystal souleater . we were feeling , at best , fine ... and not , as we stated on the record , ` ` pretty good , thanks ! '' no . no . do not do what we advised . we were so terribly terribly wrong . if you have done it already , well ... our heart goes out to those who miss you . please forgive us . please forgive us ! this has been corrections . more post-valentine ' s day news : the night vale mall ' s planned valentine ' s day art installation , involving foot age of actual beating animal hearts projected on a vivisected teddy bear , was canceled due to the entire mall being flooded with poisonous gas . the gas was described as ` ` difficult to breathe , '' and ` ` a major cause of death to those who stood in it . '' mall or officials expressed regret at the cancellation , saying , ` ` man ! it ' s like every time an artist has a bold new idea , the system has to come in and shut them down !
WTNV|The Traveler|1 March 2013|the optimism says the glass is half full . the pessimist says the glass is half empty . it is only the truth seeker who wonders , why is the glass there ? why is there water all over the floor ? why is it covering every other surface of the house ? who or what is doing this to us ? welcome to night vale . listeners , a new traveler has arrived in night vale . this is not uncommon , perfectly located as we are between several services , but this traveler is not one who will be mistaken for those other travelers – you know the ones . this traveler is said to have a foreign face and a handsome , but terrible , beard . he is reportedly wearing a uniform with silver epaulets , golden br aid , and buttons of a metallic allow not indescribable in our limited color language . this is all very similar to the marching band uniform of the desert bluff cacti prior to the incident , but the traveler ' s uniform is not scorched and soaked with blood . ` ` i can not say that i trust this interlopers very much , and his actions do not give me reasons to trust him , '' suggests the manual on interlopers , published by the sheriff ' s secret police . according to the manual , citizens are advised to not speak with the traveler , and to dig a shelter in their garden . or , if they do not have a garden , to make themselves into a metaphorical shelter through vigilance and a positive outlook . who can say what agenda the traveler might have ? he drives a large and expensive truck , he digs in the desert late at night , he does not seem adequately respectful of forbidden areas , and he has already married night vale ' s third most beautiful woman : cactus june . he persuaded her to come down from her cactus , and he has married her . i am looking at a photograph of the wedding in the newspaper at this very moment . now , i am drinking something . now , i am eating an enchilada that was just handed to me . mayor pamela mitchell called an emergency press conference today , her fourth this week . after the usual crowd had gathered around , minus those arrested at previous press conferences , she began proceedings by vibrating slightly and staring at the sun for five straight minutes . once these usual pleasantries were over she read her statement , which was the following : ` ` the fences in the cases . a heart throbbing for what it can not have . a heart not having what it needs to throb . the fences in the cases . heat from below and above , but all is cold betwixt . the fences in the cases . the fences in the cases . '' then she vanished in a puff of green smoke . several follow-up questions were asked , but since no one was at the podium , none of them were answered . many of the questions were rhetoric anyway . after the round of questioning , a few arrests were made , and the chosen journalists were led away to wherever journalists are taken when they disappear forever . all in all , a relatively uneventful press conference . and now , a public service announcement : the night vale psychological association recommends that you spend at least 30 minutes each day believing what you see . the nvpa cited a study showing that more than 60 % of all working citizens live in a self-created dome of obstinance , distraction , and sur real fantasy . when confronted with actual things outside of their own understanding – referred to by the psychologist as ` ` real life '' – most test subjects closed their eyes and pretend there was a spider or something on the ground . the study does warn that trusting your own eyes can lead to some dangers . for instance : poltergeists , roots , and humidity may create visual illusions , trick ing you into savory activities like gambling , and eating non-foods , so that they can gloat at your misfortune . but the nvpa assures us that taking what you see at face value , even if only for a few minutes daily , is the most efficient way to live . it saves the mind from the emotional stress of self-fiction and skepticism . the nvpa statement adds that ` ` you look good in that shirt , and that you should wear tighter clothing . people want to see what you look like under there ! '' they also ask you to just touch their back . ` ` you do not have to rub it . just touch it . just put your hand ... there . god , i miss you so much ! '' the report concluded . this just in : the traveler and his wife , cactus judy , were seen shopping at the ralph ' s just moments ago . he was shaking his head at the fashion of our clothing , and plucking derisively at our telephone and grocer scales . ` ` we have much better when i am from , '' said the traveler according to one report , which i am choosing to believe . he added , ` ` that ' s right , i said when and not where . '' he then winked . the sheriff ' s secret police , meanwhile , are more than a little interested in the sudden reopening of jerry ' s ta cos , located on the corner of ouroboros road . you will recall that jerry ' s ta cos was encased in amber last summer , with jerry inside . now it is as if jerry never transgressed against nature with his enchiladas . the traveler has been spotted in the vicinity of jerry ' s ta cos . if i were you – and i do not believe i am – i would be very careful about ordering anything off the secret menu at jerry ' s . definitely do not order anything off the forsaken menu . and now for corrections . in a previous report , we at night vale community radio were talking about the commonly held belief that there is such a thing as ` ` mountains . '' we scoffed at this belief , and bellowed repeatedly , ` ` it is flat all the way ‘ round . it is flat all the way 'round . '' we wrote lists of friends we knew to believe in mountains , and sent the lists to the city council , recommending that all of them be put into indefinite detention . we got physically violent with an effigy labelled ` ` mountain believer , '' punch ing it repeatedly before burning it in our station ' s blood stone circle . in fact , we devoted a full day of our programming to getting together the entire station staff and screaming in unison , ` ` mountains ? more like nothing ! '' into the microphone . recently , one of our previously mentioned friends – who thankful had not yet been apprehended by the council – took us for a drive out to a mountain . we looked at the mountain , and even touched it , and it was definitely real . therefore we are forced to admit there is indeed at least one mountain in this world , and we apologize for our previous energetic assertion to the contrary . i ' m still not completely sold on there being more than one mountain . it ' s possible that the mountain apologists built a single mountain in order to prove their sewed world view . not certain listeners , not certain ... but possible . this has been corrections . here now is an update . we ' re getting reports that the traveler was just seen , standing on the tailgate of his truck and addressing a small crowd of curious people . ` ` i have traveled here from the future . i have saved night vale from destruction , and i will save it again ! '' the traveler reportedly said to the crowd . ` ` you do not know this because your memories have been changed , along with the course of events . now that i have altered the past , i can not return to my own time . i am staying here . i will show you the way . i hope you enjoy my enchiladas . '' the sheriff ' s secret police said they can bring no charges against the traveler , as night vale recently voted to decriminalize time travel . just what did the traveler mean when he said he saved our town ? how will he save it again ? we have always trusted in the unknowable purposes of the hooded figures . can we afford to abandon what we presume is their wisdom , and follow this new prophet of tomorrow ? and now , a paid editorial , sponsored by yelp.com . this has been a paid editorial sponsored by yelp.com . here ' s a look at the community calendar . 8:00 pm thursday at dark owl records , curtis hayfield reads from his new book , where am i ? i can not see , can not feel , do not know who i am or how long i have been here : a memoir . friday afternoon is free admission day at the children ' s science museum . after school take the kid s to the newest exhibit , frog : truth or legend ? they ' ve also installed a new interactive learning room , where young scientists can play freely with such scientific items as paint thinner , nail polish remover , glass cleaner , and a half-empty bucket of gr out start er . saturday has been merged with sunday to create super day ! monday will not harm you ... but you should stock up on latex gloves , nonetheless . and tuesday is hornet-free dining at the olive garden . more news soon , but first , the weather . ladies and gentlemen and those of you not clearly falling into either category , it is my ambivalent duty to report that the traveler is suddenly gone . his photograph has disappeared from the front page of the newspaper . his truck is missing . some who reported seeing him have called back to say that they must have been mistaken , and that they have never seen anything ; that they do not even know how to open their eyes . perhaps he has leaped again through the stream of time , or passed to an alternate dimension created by the changes he has made to our world . or perhaps he was surrounded suddenly by the hooded figures , speaking in voices that only the traveler could hear . perhaps they closed in on him and he panicked as their circle tightened and tightened around him until all that could be seen by horrified onlookers were the hooded figures . and perhaps , just as suddenly , the hooded figures were gone , and nothing remained of the traveler except for a pile of indescribable buttons from his uniform – left scattered around the hole in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s . whatever happened , i can only say , ` ` farewell , traveler . '' in other news , jerry ' s ta cos , now and forever , shall be under the management of the hooded figures . plants in the vicinity of the restaurant have already begun to wilt , and animals and insects are avoiding the area . the restaurant has been renovated to resemble a nine meter-high black monolith with not visible entrance . if we learn of any change in the menu or pricing , you will be the first to know . finally , we are pleased to end today ' s broadcast with some happy news from night vale ' s hospital . there have been several additions to the community . ta k allay ' s wife , herschel , has given birth to an adult man ' s detached hand , which they have named began . the black dolphin has given birth to a smooth metallic pellet of astonishing density . it joins three previous pellets , with similarly curious properties , currently being kept inside a safe in the sheriff ' s secret police ' s secret police vault . and the beautiful widow , cactus jane , whose husband we no longer remember at all , is glad to bring into this world a baby boy she has named champ . the birth was attended by several agents from a vague , yet menacing , government agency . champ is said to be a child with a foreign face and a handsome – but terrible – beard . well , listeners , this has been another day , another night , another bit of time in this bit of space . i ' m sitting at my desk , feet planted on old , thinning carpet , but in my mind i am anywhere but . i am above , in the sky above , looking down at our little night vale . i see the lights , in grid and curves , and the places where there are no lights , because they are off ... or missing ... or invisible . i see roads with cars and the cars have people in them . and the people are traveling through the dark in the comfort and light of the cars , and i see all of this from above . i see where the town gives way gradually to the desert ; the last few lights from the last few homesteads , like stray sparks from a campfire , tossed out into the absolute black of the scrublands and the sand wastes . i see the orbit of citizen around citizen . all these ordinary night valiant , about their ordinary lives , in this singular , extraordinary place we call home . moving higher into the cold , thin air of the upper atmosphere , i see below me the criss-crossed lines of con trails and chemtrails , the signature of air machines that have long since moved on ; the footprints of our civilization upon the night sky . and looking up i see only the stars , and the void , all a little closer than they were before . all still so un-reachably distant . i have something of urgent importance to tell you , but i will tell it to you later . or i will tell it to you not at all . certainly i will not tell it to you now . now i merely look , from the vantage point of my own imagination , down at a town busy with its own existence . and , for now , existence is enough . stay tuned next for an exact word-for-word repeat of this broadcast , that will seem to you imperceptibly but unshakable different ... although you will never be able to explain why . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : find more ways to work ` ` plinth '' into daily conversation .
WTNV|The Sandstorm (Part A)|15 March 2013|blinking red light in the night sky . the future is changing , but it ' s hard to tell . welcome to night vale . listeners , the city council announced moments ago that a sandstone will be arriving night vale in just a few minutes . they apologize that they did not announce this sooner , but they just kind of let their morning slip away from them . ` ` you know how it is , '' they said in unison . ` ` you think , ‘ oh , we should announce this dangerous sandstone . that ' s priority one . ' but then you have to get some coffee , and you run into your worker friends , and then you check your email , and maybe a glance at facebook ... and you just lose track of time . you know ... '' they concluded . the sandstone is projected to be the largest in decades , and meteorologists warned that high winds and debris from the desert could cause millions in damage . they also said that if you ' re not already inside with windows closed , doors locked , and eyes shut tight , then your future will probably be very different . meteorologists then warned that raccoons are actually pretty dangerous animals despite how adorable they seem , and never , ever feed baby raccoons , because the mother laocoon will definitely attack you . ` ` have you ever had rabies shots ? oh , it is the worst , '' the meteorologists continued as the press corps got restless and hoped that the meteorologists would just shut up soon . ` ` god , meteorologists just do not know when to stop ! '' the entire press corps moaned . so , take cover , night vale . hide in your homes and offices , and pretend that mere walls are enough to protect you from nature ' s might and life ' s gravity and meaninglessness . keep your radius tuned in here ; we ' ll keep you up to date . hey , sports fan s ! assuming we ' re all still here after today , it ' s time for baseball season . this saturday is the minor league home opened for the night vale spider wolves . they ' ll be taking on bitter rivals , the desert bluff sunbeams . the spider wolves are field ing a very young but promising pitching staff this year . fan s are especially excited to see 20 year-old hometown hero train murphy get his first chance in the starting rotation . murphy graduated night vale high school two years ago and immediately joined the spider wolves – just after they discovered that he could use his telepathic powers to cripple batters emotional , often sending them into weeks-long slumps and fits of crying , even while playing in the field . the sunbeams have some changes in their team as well . this off-season , they got a new owner and a new manager , because they ' re terrible . just terrible . who even cares ? and now , traffic . highway officials are warning all night vale residents to stay off the roads . the sandstone is making travel nearly impossible . we are told that several cars have stalked near the southbound off-ramp at exit 6 on route 800. traffic officers reported that each car stretched to a halt , and through the rushing sand they could see dozens of drivers and passengers running into the road , paring off , and then fighting . they noted that each fighting pair seemed to be of the same build , gender , age , and were wearing the exact same thing . also , unrelated to the sandstone , all stop signs and traffic lights have been taken down for their bi-monthly polish ing . they ' ll be back from the cleaner on tuesday , officials said . listeners , thank you for your calls and emails . we ' re getting word that the sandstone has already begun to hit . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , called moments ago to say that the sand was thick and really flying fast – but that when it touched his skin , he could hardly feel it . he could hardly feel a thing , that the past was a fiction , and that consequences were a choice . he saw colors and shapes instead of familiar things like stoves and ponies . he shouted a bright confirmation of life up toward the sand-covered sun before gasping and screaming , ` ` no ! not you ! not you ! '' and then hanging up the phone . well , thank you , larry , for that information report . we ' ll certainly keep that in mind . old woman josie has not called , but inter dana said that old woman josie updated her facebook page with an instagram of some run e stones . dana has been furiously translating these symbols , and her best guess is that they say ` ` they come in twos . you come in twos . you and you . kill your double ! '' there ' s also a link to this amazing cat that keeps jumping in and out of boxes and oh my god , that is the cut est thing i have ever seen ! dana , you have got to post that on my wall ! oh my god , he loves those boxes so much ! and now , a look at financial news . a fallow wheat field , gray sky , cut by black vs of black birds . there is a child , dragging a hatchet . his eyes cast down . his eyes tight . his eyes white and red and superfluous . he knows not what he sees , but he knows what is there . a single black winged beast – beak cracked , feathers rotting – lights roughly on the child ' s shoulder . they stop . the bird picks at the cartilage of the boy ' s ear as if biting secrets into it . the boy groans , not unpleasantly . heavy slow clouds roll and rise , stark ly contrasted against the flickering daguerreotype hills , which socially keep the poisonous rains at bay . a sudden little river , partially walled by palsies shafts of grain , rolls by . the boy walks into it . he bends forward . his blank eyes stare into his reflection . neither he nor his mirror knows the other is there , but the bird ... the bird knows . the bird cackle , or perhaps cries . even the bird is uncertain . the boy takes a palm full of the dark water . most of it runs out through his long , zigzagging fingers . he licks the remainder from his dusty skin . a sound – like thunder , like drums , like steps . the boy turns and hurls his hatchet behind him . the bird flies up and away . there is a hideous thumb . the boy knows not what he has hit , but that it has been wounded . he waits for its retort . this has been financial news . this just in , night vale : mayor pamela mitchell has declared a state of emergency . she has asked that if you are still outside , you return home immediately ! a second announcement , shortly after , says that she was lying and that ` ` you should not listen to her . she ' s not the real mayor ! i am ! '' a third announcement followed , requesting that you ` ` give me the microphone and get away from the podium ! this is my press conference , you applicant clown ! '' the press conference then erupted into shouts of ` ` phony ! '' and ` ` impostor ! '' as the press corps suddenly doubled and began fighting itself . night vale , do be careful . i fear the sandstone to be quite a terrible event . please , stay safe inside , and should you see yourself , i can not con done murdering yourself . i just do not believe violence is ever the answer . it is a question . the real answer is far more terrifying . so , make peace with your double , night vale . do not be tempted to draw swords or guns . we can get along . oh , dear . what ... what was that noise ? dana ? is everything okay in there , dana ? who are you fighting ? dana , put down that letter opened ! dana , put away the – i ' m coming in there . um , let ' s go to a word from our sponsor . got a home improvement project ?

have i gone back in time ? vinesse ! are you in the booth ? listeners , if you can hear me , i am in a strange place . i do not know if i am in desert bluff , or if anyone can hear me . the sandstone rages outside . the vortex is still there , only it ' s black – almost a deep blue . there ' s a low hum . i do not know if this is the portal , or the storm , or my own body . there is a photo here on the desk . it is a man . he is wearing a tie . he is not tall or short , not thin or fat . he has eyes like mine and a nose like mine , and hair like mine , but i do not think he is me . maybe it is the smile . is that a smile ? i ca not say . i do hope he is safe , whoever – wherever he is . i hope i am safe , wherever – whoever i am . it is night . i think it is night . it is night . you may not know me , nor i you , but we have this mi c , and this voice , and your warm ears blossoming open to hear comforting secrets in the vibration of a voice that pulse so deep into your body , your heart relaxes for a time . and we have this , sitting right here on this odd and bloodless desk . so now , dear listeners , whoever you are , i give you the weather . hello ? night vale ? i told you i would be back . it took longer than i thought , but i have returned from whatever horrible place i have gone . along the way , in the vortex , i saw a grotesque man . a foul devil of a man . and he attacked me ! i tried to choke him to death , but i remembered . i remembered what i told you , and i let him live . i let that woeful beast live . i am sure he is not without his wounds and bruises , and i pity that he must return to that awful , awful place from whence he came and to where i most unfortunately visited . but somehow , i am happy he is alive . that i am alive . that you are alive . that we are alive . outside the winds are subsiding , the sun sweeping away our pains . i am sure there is blood staining the streets – the graffiti of our sins , the writings of an immoral but necessary battle , i presume . the bodies of some replaced by others who were – we were – all the same to begin with . and we are healing . those of us , whoever we are , who survived . those others of us , whoever we are , who conquered . whoever you are now , you are home . we are home , night vale ! you and i are together again ! my mouth , your ears , we have each other ! and for now , and always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : step 1 : write down the names of everyone you know . step 2 : rearrange the letters . step 3 : this will reveal a great secret of time .
WTNV|The Sandstorm (Part B)|15 March 2013|the future is what you make of it ! just know that your supplies are limited . welcome to desert bluff . good afternoon , desert bluff ! this is kevin , bringing you all your news and good spirits for another gorgeous day in the bluff . but before we get too comfortable , there is some news about that gorgeous day . we ' re getting word that a sandstone is moving in toward us . authorities are telling us that it is a door , and that we should all stay indoors . nothing to worry about , just stay out of the way . it will pass . as with life , and as will all things , it will pass . the sun will be upon us again , and it will be like two mornings in a day . yes ! a two-morning day ! a rebirth . a reawakening . what do you think of that , desert bluff ? inter vinesse did point out that sandstorms can do a lot of damage to cars , and if you have access to a garage , you should bring your car in . also get those pets inside , desert bluff ! we do not want all those cut e little supplies and spiders and baby raccoons getting lost out in the sandy breeze . bring those loved ones inside . a little facto id for you : ted , our staff weather man , says that no one really knows what causes sandstorms . god , he thinks . or maybe they ' re just big guests of wind that carry big things of sand . how much sand do you think there is in the world ? there ' s got to be a lot . a lot of sand . who even counts it all ? wo w ! big questions today , desert bluff . big questions . so keep your radius tuned in here , as we ' ll bring you all the latest reports from today ' s sandstone and how you can make up for all this lost time . hiding from nature is taking away a lot of business productivity , desert bluff , but i ' m sure you ' ll find time to get done what needs to get done . you wo not disappoint your town – your home . i believe in you . so mark down the time you spend cowering from the weather , okay ? and we ' ll work that time back into your schedule . great ! and listen ! get all that time in before the weekend , because this saturday , it ' s baseball season again ! desert bluff has just a great team this year . new manager samantha figgins is not only the first manager to get hired straight out of business school , but she also brings a powerful ethos of tearworn , fun , and responsibility . last year ' s sunbeams team had some excellent games , but they spent a lot of time just sitting on the bench with nothing to do , because only one person gets to bat at a time . this season , figgins plans to keep her boys active with customer orders and accounts receivable spreadsheets . baseball is not an individual sport . they ' re all in it together . as figgins says , ` ` it ' s not about winning and losing or who you ' re playing . it ' s about building the strongest possible team brand . '' the sunbeams also welcome a new owner in 2013 : strexcorp synernists incorporated . look around you : strex . look inside you : strex . go to sleep : strex . believe in a smiling god : strexcorp . it is everything . let ' s have a peek at traffic ! the highway department says all roads are running smoothly . smooth roads . smooth concrete . smooth tires . the slow undulating buzz of cars over slight hills . wardrop streets gently gliding us all to our jobs and back home . the beat beat beat of society ' s healthy heart as we all play parts in its exquisite body . oh ! i ' m getting one report that there are several stalked cars in the northbound lanes of route 800 , near exit 66. police are on the scene dealing with fistfights in the middle of the road ! now , i ca not imagine why , in a beautiful town with so many kinds of your stores and pony-petting stations , anyone would want to fight his neighbor . so hopefully that gets cleared up soon with a song and a hug . i wan na thank all you listeners for your calls and emails . the sandstone came to town more quickly than expected . lawrence ravine , out in the edge of town development , called in to say that the sand was like sand , but slightly different , that if you touched it , you could feel it ... twice . lawrence said took a scoop of sand into his soft right hand and it was if he had two right hands . he then held the sand with both soft palms and felt four hands , like one of those foreign gods , or radioactive four-armed deer that seem to be attracted to the new strexcorp distribution center . lawrence said he was making a sand angel , and then he saw himself . he said he just walked right up to himself and started making two sand angels . he said that there were two of him , just making sand angels , and that he would happily double his sand angel production today . he hung up the phone laughing like vinesse had never heard him laugh . well , thank you , lawrence . that was a useful report . inter vinesse also tells me she ' s keeping an eye on facebook to see if our other neighbors have news of the storm . i see grand ma josephine posted a photo of a lovely bouquet of white lilies outside her door . very pretty ! oh , and look at this video , vinesse ! this cat just jumps in and out of boxes ! that is adorable ! vinesse , can you sweet that to me ? let ' s have a look at financial news . the markets are jumping today , really jumping . the markets are up and down , but then back up again , like gravity and our fight to break it . the violent force of impact , ground to heel , heel to shin , shin to knee , and then back up again . muscular might and the threat of flight . a young boy heals his wounds as quickly as they form , jumping and pound ing and hitting and soaring . he reaches skyward . the drift of the body disconnected from its earth gives the flutter of wings , not just on the back , but in the belly . the moment between knowing you ' re mortal and bound to the ground , and then dreaming you have awakened a great power to fly , like those hollowed-out rodent that c log our skies with feathers and fluids – it ' s in that moment of knowing and un knowing , consciousness and bliss , that the boy sees all that can never be . upon his return to the flat hard truth , he sees things . himself . others , as they should be seen . as his equals . he gives the jumping one more go , but the magic is gone . another . still none . one more , for old time ' s sake . no . it will never be the same . well , maybe . one more . still another . he jumps and jumps and jumps ! the jumping makes a sound , like thunder , like drums , like steps . soon he is old . the up s and the down lack even the memory of the magic . they have replaced nostalgia with creaking , painful bones . he is old now . still jumping . this has been financial news . this just in , desert bluff : mayor pablo mitchell has declared today sandstone day . this massive sandstone has already damaged several apartments and malls in the northwest part of town , and it seems to be on course for even more costly wreck age , so mayor mitchell announced that we can all take today off of work . today is a citywide holiday ! a second announcement , coming from a man that looked and dressed like the mayor , said that we can make up some of our lost hours by team ing up with our doubles ! the two joined together for an inspiration call to work together with these magical doppelgangers . is this true , desert bluff ? if so , what a blessed and wonderful event , to bring us doubles of ourselves ! i am stuck inside – doing a job i very much love , of course – but if i were you , i would run outside into the sandy afternoon air and try to meet your other . how exciting ! so make friends with your mirror ed colleague , desert bluff ! think of what we could accomplish if there were two of all of us ! oh dear . what was that noise ? vinesse ? is everything okay in there , vinesse ? who are you talking to ? vinesse ! oh ! there are two of you ! what are you – ... oh , you ' re building a new shelling unit . le m me help you with that ! i ' m coming in there . let ' s go to an important message from our parent company . got something to say ? need to say it ? unfulfilled ? never made sense of what you are , who you were , who you will be ? unfulfilled ? do you forget sometimes about your own skin , your own hair , or other people ' s hair and skin ? can you make more hair , more skin ? do you need more hair and/or skin ? unfulfilled ? are you satisfied with it all ? do you see it all ? what room are you in ? what room do you want to be in ? how big is your room ? unfulfilled ? have you ever said a thing inside your brain , and then sent it to your hand to move a pencil to write it into symbols onto a paper , which used to be a tree , and then used your eyes to translate those symbols back into the thing you just said inches away in your brain , and then repaid it with your mouth into an ear ? whose ear was it ? unfulfilled ? ever eaten things that made you think differently ? breathed things ? unfulfilled ? feel things ? felt things ? we are you . strexcorp . welcome back ! listeners , i have some bad news and some good news . vinesse and her other vinesse broke one of the parts of the new shelling unit and i do not think we have anything to replace it . one of the vanessas cut her head pretty badly . when i went in , vinesse – i think our original vinesse – was standing over her with a staple gun and a clean wet rag . she also handed me a print out of an email from one of our listeners . well , i presume he ' s a listener . i ' ve never heard of him . he claims to live in night vale . i had no idea those folks down in night vale could get our tiny little radio station , vinesse . how wonderful ! you know , in all my years , i have never gone to night vale ! i bet it ' s beautiful . really , this whole desert is beautiful . i mean , when it comes right down to it , why would you ever leave desert bluff ? how can it get better , really ? i would not risk it . so steve writes , ` ` this sandstone is clearly a cover-up . i believe this was a government-created project . our government has long been participating in cloud-seeding experiments , and – '' let me stop you right there , steve carlsberg ! you have hit the nail on the head . say no more ! the government is indeed covering up their involvement – or should i say , lack of involvement in this sandstone . honestly , i do not think the government even knows how to orchestra a project of this magnitude , and of this quality . you need a well-run private business like , say , strexcorp , that has not only the faculties and materials to execute a massive geologic and psychedelic storm , but to do so inexpensively , and without tax dollars . why , without strexcorp , and companies like it , we would not have trade schools , or regulated behavior , or insurance , or helpful pandemics , or black helicopter ! thank you for your email , steve . what a great guy ! and with that , listeners , let ' s go to – ... oh my . look at that . listeners , there ' s a white , almost pink , vortex that has formed along my studio wall . listeners , words fail me . it is so beautiful ! i ca not leave you , as our show is not yet over , but ... there must be something beyond this something , desert bluff . i must see what it is ! i must go ! i will try not to be long , listeners . i will try not to be long ... hello ? hello ? night vale ? what is this studio ? what is this damnable studio ? night vale ? i do not know if you can hear me . this is cecil , and i do not know where i am . it is clearly a radio studio , but the walls are covered in blood , and instead of deals and buttons on the soundboard , there is just animal viscera , glistening under the green led lights . i hope this microphone works . am i in hell ? dana ? dana , can you hear me ? listeners , if you can hear the sound of my voice , please contact the sheriff ' s secret police . there is so much blood , it is seeping into my shoes ! there are – oh , masters of us all , no ! – teeth scattered across the floor . the window into the control booth is shattered and there is a swash of skin and a fistful of long clamping hair hanging from a sharp glass point ! i do not know if this is even night vale . i know that i can hear the sandstone raging outside . there is a low buzz and deep hum that might be my own heart ready to tear itself from my chest in horror or grief – i can not know which . there is a photo , a single photo of a man on the desk here . he is wearing a tie . he is not tall or short , not thin or fat . his hair and nose are like mine , but his eyes ... his eyes are black as obsidian and his smile– no . it is not a smile ! he must be wicked , this man ! dear night vale , please pray in your blood stone circle for me and pray , too , that no one should ever have to meet this vicious wretch of a man . i want to be home , night vale ! oh , cecil , you fool ! the vortex ... the vortex is still there . but here , it is white . okay . dear listeners , from this vile , vile place , i leave you to your prison , but before i go , because i am a radio professional and it is sitting right here on this blood-spattered desk , i give you the weather . hello there , desert bluff ! it is kevin again . i told you i would be back . i do not know where i went , but i think that i met my double . the vortex is gone now , but as i was returning , i passed a man . a man who looked just like me . i smiled and said , ` ` hello there , friend ! '' i hugged this man , and he hugged me back . we shared a moment in this other world . i am not sure to where that spiral of space and time took me , nor through where i traveled , but i am certain that there must be more to us than just us , and that there is another place , another time , where things could have been different . better . worse . but let ' s not think on would , could , and should . i am just happy i am alive . i am happy my other is alive . you are alive . we ... we are alive . outside , the winds are subsiding . our doubles have left us as the sand has left us . the sun is rising again just as it is setting . our second sunrise collides with the sunset . let ' s reflect on this . let us reflect on our lives , and where we will be tomorrow . we lost our other serves , desert bluff , but we gained new perspective . tomorrow , we ' ll wake again , work again , live again . we are home , all of us , together . my mouth , your ears . we have each other . and as always , until next time , desert bluff . until next time . today ' s proverb : step 1 : separate your lips . step 2 : use facial muscles to pull back corners of mouth . step 3 : widen your eyes . this is how to be happy .
WTNV|Poetry Week|1 April 2013|` ` you ' ll be safe here , '' says a whisper behind you . welcome to night vale . listeners , today begins night vale poetry week – one of our most sacred town traditions . as you know , every citizen is required to write hundreds of poems . non-stop poems . during this time , the city council lifts their ban s on writing utensils , thesauruses , and public descriptions of the moon . and they mandate that everybody uses their municipal ly granted free will to join in on the fun . last year over 800,000 poems were written by night vale residents , and then eaten during the poetry week ' s closing ceremonies by real live librarian who were chained to titanic posts inside double-locked steel cases . honestly , listeners , i do not think it ' s a good idea to ever have librarian out in public , no matter how secure the posts or cases are . i know there were no serious injuries last year , but some of you older listeners might remember what happened in 1993 , when an checked librarian population resulted in the loss of many innocent and screaming book lovers . but that was twenty years ago . let ' s not dwell on our corpse-strewn past . let ' s celebrate our corpse-strewn future ! on the show today , we ' ll be featuring some poems sent in by listeners from all over night vale . we ' ll start with this one . last night night vale ' s poet laureate , trilety wade , with clenched teeth and frightened eyes , delivered the opening stanza for the poetry week festivities . here is what she read : i fell in love with a hooded figure who tied my tongue with an ink ligature , and silently urged i write this poem . please believe me i was not forced , through bone telepathy or the code of morse to pen this uncorded , un-subversive gem . on the desert farms , the ghost-eyed maidens make the cheese while a maelstrom of thick milk falls with ease . our punishment ? hot-blooded clotted cream . the days here pass like cancerous sun spots and black metal trees ca not compare to car lots . you are in night vale . welcome . wade capped off her reading by screaming , ` ` it is lies ! it is lies ! '' before separating into minute white particles and fluttering away on a swirling breeze . like soft snow , she covered our hair and light coats . and , like snow , it smelled of funnel and meat . then , a voice announced over the p.a. , ` ` everything is perfect in our little town ! '' poetry week has begun , night vale . it ' s going to be a great one . this weekend , the night vale z oo finally re opens after last month ' s renovation . among the new features are fences and plexiglass to separate the animals from each other , and from z oo patrons . z oo officials promise that they focused especially on the tiger , bear , spider , and snake areas in this regard . another new feature is the sensory extraction room , where a random selected z oo go er will be dropped into a pitch black soundproof booth or two straight days , while zookeepers harvest their scent and teach it to genetically improved predator . they ' ve also un veiled a new lo go , featuring a swan being eaten by a griffe , and a new slogan : you go to the z oo so the animals can watch you . so come join in on the fun this weekend ! slow-moving children with more than 15 % body fat get in free ! oh , i ca not wait anymore listeners . poetry week has to be the most wonderful time of the year . let ' s get back to some fantastic poems that have been sent in . some of them are even from our city officials , like mayor pamela mitchell , who put her quill to parchment and sent us this lovely stanza : no one will have to be anyone ever again . in fact , it will not be allowed . that poem also doubles as recently-enacted legislation , enforced by the sheriff ' s secret police . thank you , mayor ! and now – and this is very special – a poem written by the sheriff himself . here goes : the town cries have cross-stitched their mouths shut and stapled their eyes open . the benches are all broken . no one sits down anyway . no one can fit their broken wings beneath their cloaks . a skin condition that makes its victims appear timelessly sad affects most . prominent citizens drown in the car pool lane . their make up float to the surface . wine glasses clink together . they hate each other . they clink until one breaks and then the other . there is no such thing as vagrants . there is no such thing as home . the sun has a tick . no one can afford flowers , but the children stand very still in the garden until the cold snap cracks . very pretty ! thank you , sheriff . and now a poem set in by ire na pachy , a third grade teacher from night vale elementary . it is called ` ` street cleaning day . '' run . run . remain calm . run . where are my children ? do i have children ? run . run . remain calm . run . i know . i know where . they will not go . but what way ? again , the announcement . run . run . remain calm . run . they are coming . i must choose . i have chosen . save myself . thank you , mrs p ! you did the right thing . madeline fleur , executive director of the night vale tourism board , sent in a piece of paper that just reads , in all caps : tourism is important . below that is a reddish-brown smudge shaped like an under fed hawk alighting upon a mesquite tree . she also scotch tap ed what appear to be three human molars to the page . know , at first i thought , ` ` this is not poetry . this is visual art ! '' but that ' s mere semantic . we are all poetry , night vale . every breath or branch or sigh before another hopeless night of uneasy slumber is itself a verse in a great poem . oh , here ' s a question , listeners ! have you seen those new billboards all over town recently ? they have no pictures , just hyper-bright and colourful text that reads ` ` 20 % off everything ! we ' re going to take 20 % off everything ! every thing ! we ' re crazy ! '' there ' s no store or brand associated with the advertisements , and the highway department said there ' s no record that anyone owns the billboards , or that they were ever put up . ` ` they just appeared one day , and we all sort of accepted that they were there , '' a representative from the city told us . the sheriff ' s secret police warned that the advertisement appears to be completely literal , and that soon , 20 % of everything might indeed be gone . they are still investigation as to whether or not we have a choice of which 20 % gets taken off and where that 20 % goes . scientists say that the 20 % must go somewhere , because of something to do with something called ` ` thermodynamic laws , '' but police officials remind us that scientists are comedian , and that they should stick to comedy . let ' s have a look at traffic . old town night vale resident katherine icel just sent in the following report of what ' s happening out there on the roads . katherine writes : on sunday , a lament service opened up in the street outside my house . by tuesday , birds were flying into it . ` ` i probably wo not miss you , '' my mother said . ` ` i ' m only interested in the end of the world , '' i replied . many find it difficult to breathe without the atmosphere , but we knew how ; we just stopped breathing . we ' re at the moonlight all-night din er , and they ' re serving up fruit from the plants growing out of the witness . the closed sign whispers , ` ` please , do not touch me . '' we watch bodies fall to the ground outside like deep sea creatures sur facing . you turn to me and ask , ` ` do you ever think about suicide ? '' i look away from you and close my eyes , eat the raspberries to confuse the blood in my mouth . now you ' re in the only car in the parking lot at midnight and you ' re watching me throw stones at the moon which hangs low in the sky so that he can look into your house . your sister tried to touch him from her window once , and he clinched . now he and the ocean watch her with a quiet concern . the lilac sky is trying to rest her head on his shoulder , all trees gradually growing through her . a hummingbird whispers to you , ` ` be careful . under her dress is her skin , '' and then build his nest in the middle of the highway . i look back to you , and you close your eyes . so , night vale , it sounds like you should use some alternate routes today . thank you , katherine , for that report . this has been traffic . an update now on poetry week : a strange thing has happened , listeners . a note was posted at the entrance to the dog park . i ' m told the note is on paper that is black like the ocean of space and the text is ... well , it ' s not white , really more transplendent , radiating its strange free verse message from the dark page . the message reads : today they scratched me from sleep , nails unhinged , carving my name in cement . ash stains my pillow and bruises the shape of spiders climb my neck . sunlight catches dust and broken glances between strangers lodging desert puddles of something metallic . i ' m highly contagious , quarantined to another body i ' ve since infected . i will sleep into you if you hold me too tightly . i assemble your letters left torn in the pocket of a hospital gown . i stain the paper with sweat . i ' m beginning to steal your voice . the voice that lies , dying , in the dog park . the poem is signed with just the letter ` ` e. '' listeners , while i certainly love luxuriating in the language of a good poem , i do not con done entering the dog park . it is forbidden . dogs and dog owners are not allowed in the dog park . please , disregard this renegade poet ' s radical lies and stay away . oh , i fear the damage is done , listeners . whoever this ` ` e '' is must now know we are all now in grave danger . and now , a word from our sponsor . with low interest rates , now is the perfect time to buy a home . just name your amnesty ! every house in night vale has a luxurious view of the void . we also have great schools and plenty of spiders ! who would not want to settle down in night vale ? seek a licensed reactor to help you find the house of your dreams ! reactor live inside deer . when you find an undersized stag or ailing doe you can catch , simply wrestle it down and knife open the chest cavity . then let the reactor inside help you achieve your american dream . the head of the greater night vale real ty association , russell season , says : ` ` no one has lived here for years . you ' re one of them . one of the no ones . a woman is a fire , and no one is invited . anyone can watch . no one can help . '' hey , dana ? is this a poem russell wrote for us , or ... ? ah em . so , start looking today for your new night vale home . as the old saying goes , ` ` streets swallow their own tails and choke ! '' listeners , oh , this is bad news : the gates to the dog park have been opened for the first time anyone can recall . in fact , no one even knew there were gates . we ' ve only ever seen tall black walls with no visible entrance or exit , but there are gates , and apparently they ' re just standing wide open . witnesses say that inside you can see a couple of old tennis balls , some frisbees , and a black stone monolith that is humming a hum that makes everyone who hears it feel calm , and ever-so-slightly more sensual . the city council issued a statement moments ago , which was a series of ancient glyphs . no one could read the language , but we all understood what it said . it was a dire warning . a warning to the mysterious ` ` e. '' a warning to those by the dog park . a warning to all of night vale . a great pain , a great piercing , a great scream that will soon break apart our sky and our lives if this insolence does not stop ! if you are near the dog park , listeners , do not enter it . the monolith , or whatever think you see , is not for you to know . public property is not for citizens . stay home , night vale . write your poems . this should be a fun and festive time to write government-mandated rhymes , not storming the shores of hell and bringing us all to war with you . i ' ve just sent inter dana ( or inter dana ' s doppelganger , i am still un sure ) to the dog park to warn those who are standing so near to their devise . i only hope dana is in time to save them . let us go now , possibly for the last time , to the weather . old woman josie called during the break and said that the mysterious ` ` e '' is one of the angels , and that the ` ` e '' stands for erika . ` ` erica ? '' i asked . ` ` no , no , erika , with a k , '' she said . ` ` oh , erika , with a k , '' i said . and then there was a weird pause , and then she said , ` ` all angels go by the name erika . '' and then i was like , ` ` right , right , right , '' and then i felt dumb , because that ' s , like , the first thing you learn in seventh-grade transmigration studies . anyway ... the city council , in a press conference said , ` ` oh ! an angel wrote that ? well , okay then , never mind . sure ! we ' ll show you the monolith ! come on in . '' and so those on the streets outside the dog park entered . and the city council showed them the monolith , welcoming all with friendly unturned palms . but some witnesses resisted . their conservatism served them well , for the tall black gates soon closed , vanishing into the smooth onya walls , taking the dog park visitors with them . no entrance . no exit . there may never be either again . sadly , inter dana ( or her double ) was inside the dog park when it was sealed . and listeners , i hesitate to tell you but , as a journalist , i think i must : inter dana ( or her double ) tested me a photo of the monolith just before the gates closed . did you know ? there is an inscription at its base . and get this : right here , on this , the first day of poetry week , the inscription is a poem . according to the plague , the poem was written in 1954 by former night vale mayor daniel dubois , quote ` ` in honor of nothing , that should never not be unknown . '' the poem reads : the gentle man in glow light is a candle in his maybe . his face is a loam bog . do you ever stop to look at all the blood you gather ? metal ha los spring from your attention . she said , ` ` watch with all your eyes lest chance again escape you .

WTNV|A Memory of Europe|15 April 2013|hang a map of a place you ' ll never go on your living room wall . draw new streets . tear off bodies of water . wait for news crews to arrive . welcome to night vale . teddy williams – owner of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex – has reported that he is starting an around-the-clock militia watch on the entrance to the buried city beneath the pin retrieval area of lane five . this watch will consist of a line of patriotic volunteers , armed to the teeth and forming an unbroken parameter along the whole of the bowl ing area . teddy admits that this will make bowl ing slightly more difficult than usual , and league games may have to be rescheduled ... or made illegal . but he adds that this is a small price to pay for safety . the other price for safety is $ 2.25 , which is how much he would like every single good night vale citizen to pay him for this important defensive service against the unknown – but presumably wearisome and dangerous – aggressors from the buried city . witnesses have reported seeing the apache track er out back of the bowl ing alley , in fervent discussion with a man in a ta n jacket . sheriff ' s secret police report that the conversation was too quiet for them to hear , and reminds all citizens to please hold all conversations in a loud , declaratory manner , facing outward , and making dramatic gestures to increase both the ease and excitement of their surveillance duties . the man in the ta n jacket was described as ` ` impossible to remember , '' but presumably a man of some kind , with facial features , and limbs . the apache track er was described as a real jerk , just now , by me . listeners , the coming of the first gentle winds of spring has brought me back to my college years . and to the late spring i spent backpacking through europe . truly , this is a limestone in the life of any young person able to afford it , and i am thankful for the opportunity . i remember spending a wonderful period in the country of svitz . svitz , of course – land of low rolling hills and off-key tones heard on the breeze – is perfect for the visitor with a strong constitution , and a low tendency for hallucinations . my traveling partner and i stayed in a lovely wobbed hostel , situated in a plood shock on a steep hillside . the incline meant that my partner kept rolling into me , and then we would both roll out of the shock and tumble down and down until we came to rest in a ravine full of thorns and fragrant , violently blue flowers . at which point we would grudge up the hillside , settle in , only to have it happen over again . oh , we laughed and laughed ! the situation was made stranger by the fact that i do not remember having a traveling partner before or after svitz . who was he ? who knows ? it all seemed perfectly normal at the time . i also do not know how long i stayed in svitz , rolling down that hill and climbing up again . what with the tones on the breeze , the intoxicating smell from those flowers , and the fact that it was never any time but the middle of the night , it was difficult to keep track . but it could not have been more than a decade or so . eventually i was knocked out on one of our falls and when i awoke , it was in a different country . i had aged by years , and no one i talked to knew where the country of svitz was , or even had heard of it . anyway , it was a lovely place , and i would say it ' s a must-see for any european traveler that can find it . trish hide , from the mayor ' s office , called a press conference today in which she stood in front of a large truck , painted in bright ne on colors and decorated with flashing lights , and resolutely denied the truck ' s existence . she continued this denial for several minutes , and through a lengthy round of questioning from the gathered reporter – although it should be noted that many of the questions took the form of just pointing at the truck and raising an eyebrow . ms hide admitted afterwards that the conference was simply a lookout for her denial skill , which she says she must keep sharp through constant practice ... and which she also says do not exist . she was then heard to deny the sky , the existence of a loving deity , and eggs . ` ` eggs are not real , '' she said . ` ` nuh-uh ! show me an egg ! that ' s not an egg ! what ' s an egg ? who let you in here ? '' simone rigadeau – the transient living in a re cycling closet in the earth sciences building at night vale community college – released a statement today , saying that the world has ended . ` ` the world ended three or four decades ago , '' she scrawled on a subways sandwich wrapped . ` ` i do not know what this thing is that we ' re living in , but it ' s not the world . scientists wo not investigate it because they ' re not real . turkey with extra swiss . '' i think that last bit was already written on the wrapped by a subways sandwich artist , or one of their familiar . well ... provocative stuff from one of the foremost minds in the earth sciences building , ever since it was condemned by the city as un safe and left vacant . has the world ended ? what would the world ending even mean ? and how did simone get this subways wrapped , given that all subways restaurant have many entrances , but no ex its ? as their motto goes , ` ` a thousand ways in , no way out . eat fresh . eat so terribly , terribly fresh . terribly , awesomely , gruesome , terrifying fresh . '' for more on this world-ending story , we now go live to the sound of an aquarium pump . returning now to my hay and sepia-toned european memories . another country i recall – with great fondness of course – is the nation of franchia . franchia , land of arches . it is fascinating to see how other cultures live , shaking you out of your locked-in night valiant ways . and franchia is a prime example . to see a culture that does not even have any people , a country with no population – just ancient stone arches , hundreds of square miles of arches , entertaining and leaning against each other . the wind hollows through the narrow alleyways as the lone traveler , camera in hand , explores the vast , empty cityscape . one does not need to be able to speak another language to be able to try your hand at communicating inside the borders of franchia . merely call out ` ` hello ? '' after long silent intervals , and hear your call echo back to you from the depths of the knotted , crumbling arches , unanswered . the beauty , oh listeners , of intercultural exchange . of course , despite the fun times i had curled up with a blanket through the long nights of franchia , looking up at the stars in a haze of cheap wine , no visit can last forever . eventually , i became convinced that i was not alone in the labyrinth ; that somewhere among the arches was a beast , stalk ing me . i would stand still for hours , listening to that wind , searching for the slightest sound of movement off in the distant halls of arches . i fled franchia , running desperately for the border , finding dead end after dead end before , heart pound ing , i crossed into the next country and fell to my knees on the grassy hill of the countryside , the arches having stopped completely at the border . and i swear , listeners , i swear that in the moment of crossing , i felt a single claw graze against my back . i swear , i felt the endless wind of franchia turn hot and wet – the breath of the beast inches away from my neck . so visit franchia – but , you know , watch out for the monster that i may or may not have only imagined . now , traffic . the night vale department of transportation has advised us that work crews are glittering on certain sections of route 800. computers are advised to drive slowly in these marked areas , as construction-hatted workers will be roiling on the ground all over the place , a heaving mass of limbs and lolling , panting mouths . fines for traffic violations in these marked areas are double . all fines outside of the marked areas are quadruple , as usual . also , the dot has asked me to read the following advisory notice – using their exact wording . so : silverhawk - copperhead - and the other activate i repeat activate execute - mission - alpha - november - zulu - zero - one - three lethal parameter acceptable i ' m not quite sure what that means , but if you understood it , then avoid an annoying traffic ticket by obeying ... whatever dictate was being relay ed . and remember , wear seat belts . they are a cool fashion statement , and easily obtained by cutting them out of your own car and craft ing them into any number of accessories . and now a word from our sponsors : seven lights in the window . seven lights in the hall . seven lights , seven lights , all in all . six notes in the melody . six notes form a dire . six notes to rid you of the urge . five ways of escaping . five ways all blocked off . five ways , each one broken and lost . four words in a whisper . four words in your ear . four words that fill you up with fear . three tap s of a finger . three tap s on a wall . three tap s as you try to stall . two eyes wide and desperate . two eyes squatting scared . two eyes open , yes , but nothing there . one light in the window . one light in the hall . one light , one light , all in all . ta co bell . live ma s . to return once more to pleasant reminiscence , europe is not just about looking at monuments and talking to monuments and licking monuments . it ' s also about the people . one memorable interaction happened in the little aline country of luftnarp . it had been a long day of train travel and searching for , then checking into , a cold and dreary hostel , and i was in desperate need of a warm meal and some good company . i remember heading down to the local ale house , where the proprietor stared at me , frozen , with a gaping mouth and gray , ashy skin . so did everyone else in the place . all of their mouths were stretched to almost cartoon-ish dimensions , outside of the bounds of known medical science . i asked for a plate of whatever they found most delicious , adding a quick ` ` please '' in the local language , to indicate that i was trying to blend in , and was not the usual ugly american tourist . they graciously responded by letting out a guttural rattle , in unison , and by not moving as i walked into the kitchen and devoured some of the less-moldy potatoes and a few mysteriously ( and slightly sour ) sausages . i left them , rattling away in their local tongue and frozen in a caricature of human terror , feeling like i had not only gained a good meal , but a few new good friends . big news in the science world ! scientists announce that they have discovered the world ' s deadliest spider – a previously unknown species that is as hard to spot as its bite is hard to survive . apparently the specimen was found when your dead body was examined . they say you were a portrait of agony , your skin a myriads of pulling , angry colors and ... oh – you know what ? i ' m sorry . this report is from next week . aww , things have gotten so confusing ever since the wire services started using time machines . never mind . no need to worry about that report for a few days . and now , the weather ! thinking back , ladies , looking back , gentlemen , thinking and looking back on my european tour , i feel ... a heavy sadness descend upon me . of course , it is partly nostalgia – looking back at that younger me , bustling around europe , having adventures and overcoming obstacles that , at the time , seemed so overwhelming – but now seem like just the building blocks of a harmless story . but here is the truth of nostalgia . we do not feel it for who we were , but who we were not . we feel it for all the possibilities that were open to us , but that we did not take . time is like wax , dripping from a candle flame . in the moment , it is often and falling , with the capability to transform into any shape . then the moment passes , and the wax hits the table top and solidified into the shape it will always be . it becomes the past – a solid single record of what happened , still holding in its wild curves and contour the potential of every shape it could have held . it is impossible – no matter how blessed you are by luck , or the government , or some remote , invisible deity gently sneering your life with hands made of moonlight and wind – it is impossible not to feel a little sad , looking at that bit of wax , that bit of the past . it is impossible not to think of all the wild forms that wax now will never take . the village , glimpse from a train window – beautiful and impossible and impossible beautiful on a mountain top , then you wondered what it would be if you stepped off the moving train and walked up the trail to its quiet streets and lived there for the rest of your life . the beautiful face of that young man from luftnarp , with his gaping mouth and ashy skin , last seen already half-turned away as you boarded the bus , already turning towards a future without you in it , where this thing between you that seemed so possible now already , and forever , never was . all variety of lost opportunity spied from the windows of public transportation , really . it can be overwhelming , this splattered , inert wax recording every turn not taken . ` ` what ' s the point ?

WTNV|The Whispering Forest|1 May 2013|there is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful , and that line is covered in jellyfish . welcome to night vale . ladies and gentlemen , several of you may have noticed the new forest that has formed just to the east of night vale . it ' s hard to say how these dense , pine woods have cropped up in a vast desert waste-scape , nor how they have grown in only a couple of days , but these woods are encroaching quickly on our little town . botanist from night vale community college said that this beautiful , lush woodland is called the whispering forest – and that , while lovely , should not be approached . officials from the night vale parks department agreed with this sentiment in a prepared statement wherein they just wrote the word ` ` no '' on a single piece of paper , but with hundreds of ‘ o ' s and maybe two dozen ' n ' s , so it reads kind of like : nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ! or maybe it ' s more of an echo-y scream . it ' s hard to say – they did not include stage directions in their press release . what we do know is this : there is a whispering forest just outside of town , and it should not be approached under any circumstances . the night vale school district announce that schools will be closed all of next week , because nothing really matters , and is anything even real ? they cited the ever-widening night sky as the impetus for this decision . ` ` how can we place any importance on something so insignificant as ma th or spelling or history when the void has already swallowed our tiny existence ? we are ants , crushed daily by the indifferent feet of the universe , and – it ' s just no good anymore ! we ca not carry on like this , '' the school board said , swinging on a bottle of table wine and sobbing their heads weakly . the school board president , an enormous glow cloud that drops animals from great heights and casts a looming fog of despair over all it covers , added , ` ` grovel , mortals . put your tongues to the soil and beg for your worthless lives ! '' some parents , of course , are very upset by the decision to close schools , saying that we ca not let the vast incomprehensibility of the unknowable universe stop us in our tracks . we have to keep pushing forward . treasurer of the night vale pta diane creighton said , ` ` school is a meaningful part of a child ' s life , and to just shut it down because you ' re scared of your own insignificance is ridiculous . see ? i ' m looking at the sky right now ! '' creighton continued , ` ` and i ' m saying , you ca not hold me back , sky ! i can do any i can – i– ' '' creighton then stopped speaking , lowered her loosening fist to her side , and then sighed audibly . she added , ` ` nothing is real , i do not think . whatever . who cares ? '' then she stared back up at the sky , and a single tear zig-zagged down her right cheek as she mumbled something about trees having the right idea . and now , a public service announcement : the night vale psychological association , in conjunction with a vague , yet menacing , government agency , has asked that all citizens start keeping dream journals . dream journals can be a spiritually satisfying exercise in understanding your unconscious mind , helping you to fully examine your being , and balance your emotions . they also can be rife with useful data for government officials and corporate marketing executive . of course , dear listeners , many of you are saying , ` ` well , this sounds fantastic , cecil , but how do you keep a dream journal ? '' good question ! i have kept one for years now , and i must say i agree with the nvpa on this . it seems hard , at first , because you have to get in the habit of writing first thing in the morning , and also because the city council ' s ban on all writing utensils is still in full effect . but once you learn how to create a makeshift non-pen out of a cocktail straw , some cotton , and any number of colourful municipal food past es , you ' ll be good to go ! in an effort to educate night vale citizens about dream journal ing the nvpa has created this helpful how-to : step one : find a foreign dictionary or hymn . it is strongly preferred that you choose something in russian or ukrainian , but german will work too . step two : carve out several pages , creating a secret compartment in the book . step three : write down your dream in great detail the moment you wake up . step four ( and this is the most important step of all ) : eat the paper you wrote the dream on , and then place a bird skeleton in the book . finally , bury the book near a magnolia or willow tree , and repeat each day . the sooner you start this process , listeners , the sooner you can start actualizing your existence , exploring your inner self , and the sooner the sheriff ' s secret police can track down and arrest those vile miscreant who keep dreaming about horses . more on the whispering forest : larry le roy , out on the edge of town , said that he went out to the whispering forest this morning , just to see what all the fuss was about , and said that as he neared the woods ' edge , he felt a terrible sense of fear , and began to tremble and sweat . but then he heard a small , engendered voice whisper , ` ` you look so nice today , larry . i like what you have done with your beard . and just look at that belt ! is that new ? '' and of course , larry ' s beard is looking very good , listeners . he finally grew out his old goatee and stopped dying it black . it ' s now a full , even blanket of soft-looking pepper wisdom , comforting his wise noble face . the forest is totally right ! so larry said he entered the woods , and all his angst just melted away . he felt young and carefree in a way he d never felt , and the woods told him they loved him . ` ` we love you , larry , '' the whispering forest reportedly whispered . ` ` you are good , and you look good . do you want to hang out more ? let ' s hang out , and tell some jokes , and maybe play games ! you are a good friend . let us be friends . '' larry said he wanted to stay , but that he remembered that he had cable to , and did not want to miss anything just because there was some beautiful nature he d never explored . so he went home to catch an iron chef america marathon . so , listeners , it sounds like the whispering forest is actually pretty nice . i ca not imagine what all those academic types and bureaucratic pen-pushers were going on about . larry made it sound like a really friendly place ! i ' m going to send inter richard out there , and see what else we can learn about this fascinating new addition to our landscape . and now a look at the community calendar : monday is the opening of the new exhibit at the children ' s science museum . the exhibit is called ` ` the moon is a lie ! '' it explores how the moon is a government-created myth to keep us all from knowing about the ancient alien machinery that controls the ocean . in the hands-on learning room , children will be able to make their own moons out of styrofoam and aggressive propaganda – just like the masons did ! tuesday , bud dy holly returns to dark owl records . there will be no performance , or book signing , and no one will see him . he will just ... hover over music lovers ' shoulders and disapprove of their disguised musical tastes . incorrect shippers will receive a bout of uncontrolled sobbing and a horrify ing chill up their spine from the legendary rock ' n ' roller himself . thursday is re cycling pick up day . paper goes in blue bags , plastic in clear , and any teeth you have lost because of last week ' s public water misha should be gently placed in a wooden box and set fire . friday , at the night vale recreation center , are cooking classes for beginners . amateur chefs can learn about knife skill , the basis of baking , and a seminar about whether or not deer feel pain or are just sad . saturday afternoon is a secret parade . you will know where and when it is if and when you are chosen to see its secret float and hear its secret songs . sunday is the day we decided last fall we would clean up around here . you promised ! we need to clean up , ok ? and that ' s this sunday . do not make other plans , you always do that ! you are always doing that ! and now , a word from our sponsor . you can not see . you grope around wildly as your footing is also unstable . you feel a thin liquid filling your shoes . it is not water ; you can tell . a pungent smell of bring , or anxiety . your hands strike something solid . a wall , you think . it is soft , leathery , but also wet . you keep your hands to the surface and it is moving in and out , like it is breathing . no . more like ... spasms . you hear a dull rumble from above ; a gurgle from below . you still see nothing . the walls jerk back , quickly . you lose your balance and slide down to the floor , which is the same surface , but now the liquid is sloshing past you . something grabs your leg . something is grabbing your leg ! you are being pulled down ! you can not see which way . madness ! which way , madness ? you scream , but no sound comes from your stubborn lips , your impudent throat . you reach ... for what , you do not know . only that you reach . a blinding flash , a moment of understanding . you are in an empty storeroom , tied to a chair . there are others , but they are hooded and limp . you recall this living nightmare . you take comfort in its familiar pain . you smell fomentation and can hear a dull , unending beeping . someone shouts in a language you do not know . you love your family . you love them ! welcome to red lobster . come see what ' s fresh today . more on the whispering forest : inter richard called to say the woods are stunning , and the moment he arrived , they were so welcoming . ` ` richard , you have lovely green eyes . i ca not believe i just noticed them ! that shirt really brings out those piercing gems . you also have nice soft hands . do you play guitar ? would you like to play guitar ? do you like music ? '' the forest apparently whispered . richard reported to me that he wanted to stay in the forest , but i told him that he still has inter tasks to do here at the radio station , like filing ad contracts and re naming the wigless insects , but he insisted on staying . richard told me that his feet started itching at first , then tingling – a very pleasant tingle . he then noticed gray-brown patches forming along his feet and legs and he could not move , and richard assured me that this was exactly what he wanted , but i have already sent for help . ladies and gentlemen , for your safety , please stay away from the whispering forest . do not listen to its hollow compliments , its sappy flattery . learn from larry le roy . stay inside and watch television ! there is no reason to go explore nature . no reason ! so , as i try to find out what has happened to our station inter , let us go to the weather . well , listeners , there ' s good news and bad news from the whispering forest . the bad news is that inter richard – as we know him – is lost to us forever . as are the dozens of first responded , concerned citizens , and curious nature lovers who all went to the whispering forest today . to the family of richard , let me say i am terribly sorry for your loss . he was an excellent inter , and he will be missed . the good news is that none of those we lost today are technically dead . according to simone rigadeau , from the earth sciences building at night vale community college , the whispering forest is a place where we can all plunge our feet and hands into the cool , soft soil , allowing our fingers and toes to grow and spiral into the earth , quickly and deeply entertaining with themselves , each other , shaking in and through a complex organic network to become one . in the whispering forest , everyone is one . everything . they share each other now . i know simone is only a transient who lives in an unused storage closet in the earth sciences building and not an actual scientist , but i thought that was a beautiful story , and it brought some meaning to the otherwise meaningless life of an inter . so ... rest easy , night vale , knowing that we have lost no one today . they have gained each other . they share the soul of the whispering forest now , and we will have them , always . or ... at least however long trees live , which i think is fairly long ... i ' m not really sure . i had a hamster as a child and it died in , like , two weeks , so me h ! what do i know ? stay tuned next for the sound of a rapidly beating heart . as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : if you love someone , set them free . set them free now . this is the police , and we have you surrounded .
WTNV|Eternal Scouts|15 May 2013|we report only the real , the semi-real , and the verifiably unreal . welcome to night vale . here at the station , we have been receiving many calls and e mails over the last several months asking us about khoshekh – the cat found covering in the men ' s bathroom . well , he is doing just fine , and thank you very much for your concern . in fact , he recently gave birth to an adorable litter of kitten . how does a he cat give birth ? well , how does a he cat hover in an immobile spot in a radio station bathroom ? some things just are not meant to be questioned . most things , actually . we slipped a note under station management ' s door , asking if we could keep all those adorable , floating kitten . management responded with a great thrashing behind the closed door of their office , and a localised rain storm in the break room . we are still working with the station oracle to understand their message , and we will let you know soon what we do with the kitten . exciting news from the night vale chapter of the boy scouts . two of their members – franklin wilson and barton donovan – have achieved all the necessary requirements to advance from the rank of fear scout to that final and most terrible of ranks : eternal scout . the ceremony will take place at an specified time today , in the hole in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s , and anyone is invited to attend . those who wish to view the ceremony should wear loose-fitting clothing and tell everyone they know that they will be going on a long trip – oh , just somewhere , to clear their heads , you know ? and that they do not know when they will be back , but it wo not be for a long time , probably . ` ` i just really have to find myself , and i think the open road is the place to do it , '' you should say . ` ` do not look for me , '' you should continue , taking hold of your loved one ' s shoulder and maintaining an intense eye contact . ` ` do not look for me . '' the city council voted this week to make death a meritocracy . ` ` for all of human existence , death has been a communistic sort of event , '' the council said in a prepared statement , and that ` ` we live in america , where it is not the government ' s job to give death to every single citizen . '' the council noted that from now on , death would be earned through hard work and productivity , not just as a handful for every resource-sucking freeholder on the street . ` ` if you want to die , '' the council said , ` ` you will have to achieve death yourself . not everyone gets to die , and that ' s just how it will be . '' the vote won by a small margin , with the opposition split between keeping death universal and others pushing for banking death altogether . listen , night vale , i do not know about you , but i am for this new merit-based system of death . if everyone gets to die , then no one will really value death . i used to be young , and idealistic , and think that death was a human right , that everyone deserved to die . but now , i realize that dying is very hard work . i ' m working hard every day , trying to die , but you do not hear me complaining , ` ` oh , government , where ' s my free death ?
WTNV|The Mayor|1 June 2013|the sun has risen . you are awake . this symmetry is not without meaning . welcome to night vale . listeners , i ' m receiving word from the sheriff ' s secret police that mayor pamela mitchell has gone missing . after this morning ' s press conference , where she updated the media on standard mayor al news – stuff like her favorite kinds of rocks and a demonstration on hatchet sharpening – she walked to her office and then disappeared . trish hide , one of mitchell ' s suffers , said , ` ` mayors can disappear . it ' s not a big deal . she disappears all the time . she can fly and turn into a horse too ! it ' s perfectly within her rights , as mayor , to turn invisible . to disintegrate into a thin cloud of imperceptible existence . '' hide continued , ` ` in fact , i can disappear if i want to . because i work for the mayor , i have all of the mayor ' s powers . i just do not use them all the time ... out of respect for the mayor . '' when pressed by reporter to show her powers , hide reluctantly agreed , saying , ` ` uh , just this once , '' and then standing in place , visibly straining , eyes bulging , cheeks reddening ; there was a long , uncomfortable silence before hide said , ` ` well , i ca not do it with everyone watching . turn around , okay ? '' but then , before anyone could turn around , she vanished , leaving behind only a light white puff – like baby powder – a faint smell of lives , and an echoing voice that said , ` ` no , wait , i–i got it ! see ? '' if anyone has any information on the mayor ' s whereabouts , please contact the sheriff ' s secret police , or just speak into any phone . they are all bugged , of course . the night vale community theater is proud to announce the opening of their long-awaited production of once on this island . the location , and cast , are a secret . curtain is promptly at 8:00 , and those seeking autographs of cast members after the show should ask themselves why signatures are valuable and what that particular kind of transaction even means . the night vale daily journal has indicated their intention to review the musical , as soon as they can find out where the performances are taking place . they are interrogative anyone who might provide them with the necessary information . i am , myself , an aficionado of the theater – having once played the role of pippin in a high school production . the musical being produced was actually south pacific , but our director had a real flair for experimental theater , and felt the addition of characters from other famous plays would spice things up . he also hid dangerous traps all throughout the set in order to keep us on our toes . oh , it was a wonderful couple of months , preparing for and performing in front of parents and friends , and those of us who were left at the end of it felt like we had truly been through something . something we would never forget . not even in the middle of the night , staring blandly into the darkness . sweat ... pallid ... trembling . students and seniors receive a 10 % discount on all tickets to the hit musical . here ' s a public service message to all the children in our audience : children , the night sky may seem like a scary thing sometimes . and it is . it ' s a very scary thing . look at the stars , twinkling silently . they are so far away that none of us will ever get to even the closest one . they are dead-eyed sigils of our own failures against distance and mortality . and behind them , just the void . that nothingness that is everything , that everything that is nothing . even the blinking light of an airplane streaming across it does not seem to assuage the tiniest bit of its slackness – like throwing a single stray member into the depths of a vast arctic ocean . and what if the void is not as void as we thought ? what could be coming towards us out of the distance ? insentient osteoid with a chance trajectory ? sentiment beings with a malicious trajectory ? what good could come of this ? what good , children , could come of any of this ? fear the night sky , children , and sleep tight in your beds , and the inadequate shelters of blankets and parental love . sleep sound , children . this has been our children ' s fun fact science corner . more on our missing mayor : listeners , this might be worse than i could have imagined . i ' m receiving word that old woman josie and a gentleman that may or may not be an angel friend of hers – depending on whether or not angels are real , or if they are real , but are not really friends with josie , or not real but suddenly became real because josie willed them into existence . however it is , josie and her exceptionally tall winged friend saw mayor mitchell earlier this morning near the moonlite all-nite din er , talking to a man in an offensively cartoon-ish native american headdress . listeners , that is most certainly the apache track er , and look – i do not know what he is up to , but everywhere he goes , nothing good happens . for instance : last time he went to the post office , they had to spend months cleaning the blood off the walls and hire who knows what kind of specialists to stop the dis embodied screaming coming from every darkened corner . i mean , what kind of contractor even specialized in removing screams ? well , besides shriek-tronics , of course , but they moved their offices to several miles deep underground , and mostly just generate earthquakes for the government these days . the point is that the apache track er – despite his recent unexplained transformation into a real native american – is not who he claims to be , and is not a trustworthy individual . i can only fear the worst for mayor mitchell . old woman josie said she saw the two in a heated discussion that culminated in the apache track er opening a leather briefcase , which in turn released a thick cloud of black flies – more than you would think could fit into a normalized fly briefcase . the man with the insensitive feathered headdress then got into the backs eat of a black sedan . josie said she saw the driver clearly , and recognized him , but could no longer remember any details about his face . josie did not see where the mayor went , though , as her possible angel friend was spending a lot of time explaining why an assisted triple play in baseball is so rare . and she got distracted , because it seemed like a really important story , and she did not want to seem rude . listeners , we have contracted the sheriff ' s secret police . if you see this black sedan , the mayor , or have any other information ( including light and citrus-y dessert recipe for our up coming special on fresh summer cuisine ) , please contact us immediately . and now , a word from our sponsor . listeners , are you lost ? do not know where to turn ? might i recommend the brown stone spire . do you need cash ? cast your eyes to the brown stone spire . alone , drowning in back taxes and legal problems ? look at the brown stone spire . night vale ' s newest spire – built in the night several weeks ago by unknown agents , or aliens , or animals , or just our collective imagination – the brown stone spire offers itself to all those who are down on their luck , or destitute , or simply being crushed by the consequences of their own maleficence . the brown stone spire does not care . the brown stone spire does not discriminate based on petty morals . divorce ? out of work ? give yourself to the brown stone spire . you might be asking , how much does it cost to receive help from the brown stone spire ? i can assure you it does not cost any money . it costs ... other things . but if you ' re concerned about what those costs are , then you are not in enough trouble for the brown stone spire . you just need a lawyer . but if you are filled with glass shares of regret – the brown stone spire – or screaming impotent ly at an indifferent moon , then no need to look ! the brown stone spire will find you . the brown stone spire has a slogan . it can not be pronounced . this message was brought to you by wen dy ' s . during the commercial break , listeners , we received several calls from drivers saying that they saw the apache track er in a black sedan , but that the mayor was not with him . he and his driver , who they could not describe , were standing outside the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , still , un moving , a swirl of dust and smoke spiral ing slowly about them , a soft rumble below the sand , and the visceral tension of something about to burst . so much bad news with those two men , night vale . stay away from the fun complex , if you can . not only these men , but there is also that secret civilization living under lane five that is planning a great war against us . on the other hand , tonight is dollar beers and free jukebox tokens . listen , you do what you want . it ' s your choice . but i ' m just saying , that apache track er or whatever he likes being called ... i mean , if you knew someone who was always affecting a derogatory accent or told racism jokes , you would not be friends with them , right ? so ... who would hang around this guy ? what a jerk ! still nothing on the mayor , dear listeners . the city council has even become upset over this . they have been on the steps of city hall , pacing and howling in unison like elephants in mourning . listeners , i know we do not always agree with the mayor , and sometimes we just despise our elected officials because of the artifice of political parties , or because they do not represent every one of our very specific interests , or because they are a different species , or have frightening supernatural powers and threaten violence against innocent citizens . i understand all of this . no politician is perfect , night vale ! but mayor mitchell has overseen some great moments in our town ' s recent history . she increased funding for the cancer ward at the night vale hospital . and now , anyone who wants cancer can get cancer ! whether or not they have health care or a reason to live ! she regularly visits night vale elementary school classes to promote youth literacy by reading children ' s classic like murakami ' s the wind-up bird chronicle , or any number of cor mac mccarthy ' s novels . she has been controversial , to be sure , but she is our leader , our parent . she cares very much about us , night vale , and when she jails or tortures someone without just cause or due process , it is because she loves this town so much . let us find our mayor , night vale ! but first , let us go to the weather . listeners : moments ago , mayor mitchell was found . she was holding an impromptu press conference . the press had to stay at least 500 feet away from her , as she was standing at the edge of the dog park . and no one , except city officials and hooded figures , are allowed that close . mayor mitchell apparently set up a podium and quietly delivered a prepared statement without a microphone and no one could hear what she had to say . two hooded figures were standing behind her . but listeners , oh , listeners , do we ever have a scoop ! former inter dana , who i thought had been lost forever after she was swallowed up by the dog park two months ago , well ... she tested me , just now , from whatever plane of existence she ' s on . dana is still alive , and in the dog park , and she heard the mayor ' s speech . and it turns out , mayor pamela mitchell is stepping down by year ' s end ! other reports indicated the mayor concluded by lighting the podium on fire , kicking it over , and climbing the 12-feet high , smooth obsidian walls quickly , gracefully , like a salamander , and then shouting several things that sounded like russian vulgarities . the hooded figures stayed outside the dog park and stared down reporter , who grew gray and hunched with melancholy . many began wailing and clutching their eyes . listeners , first of all , it was so nice to hear from dana . we miss her so . i tried em ailing her back , but ... my thumbs began to burn and slacken , and blood began tickling from my nose as i wrote , so i had to stop . hopefully , we will see dana again . time is weird . so is space . i hope ours match again someday . as for the mayor , well , this is surprising ! did the secret police force her hand ? some vague , yet menacing , government agency ? would this have anything to do with the poetry week incident , where actual night vale citizens , like dana , got inside the forbidden dog park ? or maybe it was simply the mayor ' s choice . it ' s actually a good way to go out . the last six mayors were all executed quite publicly and creative ly . remember that many junior high students still learn about the skeleton system from the late mayor tom garmin himself . so , to get to announce your own retirement is pretty excellent . maybe mayor mitchell needed to spend more time with her family . or , maybe she has been exiled to the dog park for sins yet unknown . or maybe , she plans to grow into a tree by joining the collective life force and single shared soul of the whispering forest , which has become a very popular lifestyle choice these days . all i know , night vale , is that we should all be so lucky to set our own future . dana did not . i do not know that i will . each day the sun rises and sets . the moon pulls the tides . our hearts beat . our loved ones love us back . and we share our inhaled and exhales with the great organism that is our tiny planet . but , as you watch the sun rise again tomorrow morning , think to yourself : past performance is not a predict or of future results . and then force a smile , drink another cup of coffee , and try not to look down as you walk across the soil that will eventually fill your lifeless lungs and purpose your corpse . each day that is , is a blessing , night vale . and now , stay tuned next for the popular radio game show , wait , wait , do not ! no , do not ! please , do not ! good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : the most dangerous game is man . the most entertaining game is broadway puppy-ball . the most weird game is esoteric bear .
WTNV|One Year Later|15 June 2013|a friendly desert community where the sun is still hot , the moon still beautiful , and mysterious lights still pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep . welcome to night vale . word is in about a disturbance at the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex . there has been the sound of chanting and machinery from under the pin retrieval area of lane five , and teddy williams has changed all the boilers ' names on the electronic score cards to ` ` they are here ! '' this is causing some confusion , and has completely ruined jeremy godfrey ' s 50 th birthday party – which had rented out a few lanes for the afternoon . jeremy was last seen drinking a light beer out of a plastic cup , shaking his head sadly as he wished the liquid around , and looking out the window at the sky ( mostly void , partially stars ) . teddy williams was last seen howling , commanding his militia to surround the pin retrieval area and prepare for an attack . and carlos – sweet carlos , brave carlos – was last seen approaching the entrance to the underground city , saying he was going to get to the bottom of this , that someone had to , and that teddy williams was deranged . teddy williams was then last seen saying , ` ` oh yeah ? oh yeah ? say that to my face , big shot ! '' but carlos , my poor carlos , was already gone . i fear , night vale . i fear for what we know . i fear for what we do not know . i fear for what we do not yet know that we do not know . the apache track er stood outside of the bowl ing alley , lowering at the entrance and shaking his head . i remind you that this is the white guy who likes to dress in a cartoons approximation of a native american , and claims to have ` ` mystical powers . '' he ' s a real racism jerk , and no one likes him . and the fact that he recently disappeared and reappeared as an actual native american changes nothing . and neither does the fact that he can now only speak russian . he is still the same embarrassment to our town he always was . anyway , he ' s lowering at the entrance , arms crossed , wearing one of his stupid plastic feather he addresses . but ... back to carlos . carlos the scientist . perfect of stature and bearing , perfect of tone and taut , and time having fixed what the barbarous barber telly so treacherous snipped away , perfect of hair . one year . one year later . listeners . listeners ! one single year since two major events in our town ' s history . first , the opening of our lovely state-of-the-art dog park ( which is forbidden , and which i will not mention again ) . second , and most important , it is one year since the arrival in night vale of our most beloved and singular citizen . he came to us to investigate our town . because , he said , it was scientific ally extraordinary , and downright bizarre . we had no idea what he was talking about , but with his golden voice ringing out from the bell of his mouth , who among us could argue with the content of such perfect speech ? oh , just one short year ago . i had arranged a small ceremony to mark this occasion , and invited carlos to attend . however , it looks like he will be ... delayed . but i am not worried . i am not upset . i know that carlos will be here for the ceremony . i have the trophy here in my hand . i am holding the trophy and i am not upset . carlos will be here . he will . i am holding the trophy ! in other news , a commercial airline appeared today inside the home of surprised night vale citizen beck y canter bury , who said she was about to get into the shower when it roared down her halfway and then disappeared , as suddenly as it had arrived . there is no conclusive evidence that this is the same airline last seen in the night vale elementary gym one year ago . but we have jumped to that conclusion and will defend it against all naysayers , violently and without mercy . our truths may or may not be true , but they are ours , and we stand by them – even as the experts and skeptics hold aloft cupboards and in tone to us about ` ` snow '' and ` ` mountains . '' beck y added that she would like to take that shower now , and that she has no idea how we managed to arrive for an interview mere seconds after the incident occurred . ` ` my doors are locked ! '' she said . ` ` my windows too ! i ' ve had my eyes shut for years ! how did you get in here ? '' the local chapter of the n ra has begun market-testing some possible new slogans . these include : guns do not kill people , blood loss and organ damage does guns do not kill people , people kill guns a list of things that kill people : 1. conceivable , anything 2. not guns ! guns do not kill people , we are all immortal souls living temporarily in shelters of earth and meat and , if you say guns kill people one more time , i will shoot you with a gun , and you will , co incidentally , die to vote on the new slogan , simply fire a gun at the object or person that best represents your choice . parents , let ' s talk about safety when taking your children to play out in the scrublands and the sand wastes . all children in night vale are missing this week , so there ' s no current safety issues . hope we find ‘ em ! oh happy day ! i have just received word that carlos returned from the entrance to the city , gesturing to everyone around and asking them to follow him . he lead them into the pin retrieval area , which is not an easy place for a crowd , so there was a lot of crouching and saying ` ` excuse me . excuse me ! '' but soon enough , they were all arrayed on the cliff top , overlooking that dreaded subterranean metropolis . teddy williams , and his militia , and the folks that had come for jeremy ' s birthday , and jeremy himself – still holding his plastic cup of beer and leaning morosely against the wall , pointedly refusing to look where everyone else was . this was the first time most of them had seen the city . it seemed so distant below them , its strange spire s small and far away . the windows in the buildings , alight with the fire of hostile life , were tiny dots from where they stood . they could hear the footsteps of the approaching army , the chanting ! many of them quaker with fear , but not carlos . my brave carlos stepped out into the pit , climbing down the slope . at first , onlookers were horrified at his lunatic descent . then , they were confused ... as he got to the city much faster than they expected . and then , there was panic , as their eyes told them a story they could not understand , let alone believe . ` ` behold , '' said carlos , standing in the center of the underground city , ` ` this is not an enormous city miles below the earth . it is a very small city about ten feet below the earth , populated by tiny people , who have had to spend a year slowly climbing the ten feet to our world !
WTNV|Faceless Old Woman|1 July 2013|trumpets playing soft jazz from out of the dark desert distance . they come tomorrow . it is too late for us . welcome to night vale . did you know there ' s a careless old woman who secretly lives in your home ? it ' s true ! she ' s there now . she ' s always there , just out of your sight . always just out of your sight . because you can not see her , you were probably completely unaware that this woman likes to si ft through photo of you and your loved ones . she softly touches each face , as if wishing it were her own . or perhaps claiming it as her own . or perhaps simply cursing that person . it ' s hard to say . you ' ve never seen her doing this . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home does lots of things . ever wonder why your web brows er ' s history is filled with bin g searches for – quote – ` ` pictures of dead wolves , '' or – quote – ` ` the melting point of birds ?
WTNV|First Date|15 July 2013|mountains . endless mountains ! peak after barren peak . and what lies , restless , in the shadow ed valleys ? i can not say . i can not say ! welcome to night vale . hello . let ' s start there . let ' s start with a greeting . a simple ` ` hello . '' and then let ' s move right into the most exciting news , the most wonderful news ! as you may remember , a few weeks ago , along with the beginning of a vicious war against us by tiny people , from a tiny underground city , carlos – the beautiful scientist – finally returned my expressions of affection . and not in that dry science way he always used to use , saying things like , ` ` i ' m not calling for personal reasons , i need to tell your radio audience about a strange hole that might appear in their wall . '' oh yeah , i forgot – there ' s a strange hole that might appear in your wall . he said it was important to tell you ... especially after what happened in the smithwick house . i forgot . that was a while back , so i guess it does not matter much now . but yesterday , when he called me , he started his call by saying , ` ` i am calling for personal reasons . also , my calculations show a strange source of energy approaching the town , but not emanating the kind of light that such a source should . '' is not that so sweet ? and well ... one thing led to another , and last night we went out on our first date . i just have to tell you about it ! i have certain obligations , though , so first , let ' s get to the news . the sheriff ' s secret police , in association with a vague , yet menacing , government agency , announced that those truck s full of crates far out in the desert are nothing , and that we should not worry about them . the truck s , which no one in town knew about until this announcement , are filled with crates that are warm to the touch . some of them tick , others do not . ` ` do not even worry a little about them , '' say the secret police . ` ` forget we said anything . no , really , remembering we said anything is now against the law . '' we reached out to lieutenant regis , of unit 7 of the local national guard station and of combo store , for a comment , and he said he ' s been ` ` ruminating on a lot of things . just a lot of stuff ' s been running through my mind . that ' s an interesting phrase . ‘ running through the mind . ' where are those thoughts going ? are they trying to leave ? and if so , where ? '' when pressed to comment specifically about the truck s full of crates out in the desert , he just repeated everything he had said , with the exact same infections and gestures . well ... i ' m sure these crates wo not come up again , and pose no future danger to any of us . no more on this story , ever , i ' m sure . the night vale public library will be expanding into a second branch : the night vale private library . this library will be right next door to the current location and will be available only to one person : local millionaire marcus vanston . it will contain thousands of books on any given subject , an interactive children ' s area shaped like a full-sized pirate ship , and a biography section featuring not just biographies of helen hunt , but also biographies of se an penn . plans include floor-to-ceiling windows facing the public library , which marcus , the only person who will ever be allowed inside , says he will use to stroll nude through his library , staring ordinary citizens in the eyes as he does not read or make any use of the towers of books around him . marcus continued , ` ` maybe i will pick up a book and open it as though i were going to read it , but then reveal to those watching that i am holding it upside-down before laughing and throwing the book away ! i ' m not sure . i have not planned out every moment . i will definitely be nude , though . '' the public library board of directors issued a statement via loudspeaker from their helicopter that hovers continuously over our city , indicating that they feel this expansion will serve the community , by showing how rich marcus is , and what a great guy that obviously makes him . and have you seen how many cars that guy owns ? wo w ! reports also indicate that the night vale private library will be entirely free of librarian – a fact that will be of little comfort to the many public library-goers who are injured or killed in librarian maulings every year . remember , if confronted by a librarian while looking for a book to check out , do not attempt to escape by climbing a tree . there are no trees in the library . and the precious moments it will take you to look around and realize this will allow the librarian to strike . do not become a statistics . all right ! news done ! so , now let ' s talk about the date . carlos and i met up in old town . i was wearing my best tunic and furry parts . and he had on a laid-back weekend lab coat . we were both beautiful in the late afternoon sunlight , each other ' s dreams met in a real world moment . our destination was none other than gino ' s italian dining experience and gr ill and bar – the fancies restaurant in town . it was a perfect day ... other than the strange blot of darkness buzzing on the edge of town . but that was probably yet another apple bee ' s under construction . we went arm in arm into gino ' s and were immediately seated , with no memory of who greeted us at the door or how we got to our table – situated in a class , understand , and absolutely doorless room . the full gino ' s experience . their menu is somewhat limited after the ban on wheat and wheat by-products , so we each ordered a single portobello mushroom , served rare and bloody ( as is the gino ' s way ) . from the window , we had a great view of the sunset , and of the buzzing shadow thing , which seemed to have moved closer . ` ` i ' ve been thinking , '' carlos said . ` ` uh-huh ? '' i said . ` ` yeah , that ' s what i ' ve been doing lately , '' he said . ` ` thinking . it ' s part of being a scientist . what have you been up to ? '' and so we talked . just us and our bleeding mushrooms , and the buzzing shadow presence , and a blooming haze of romance in the air . wait hold on . station management is apparently getting agitated , uh , failing around their office and howling , so i need to do some more news real quick . violent incidents increased across the entire night vale area over the last several weeks as the people of the miniature city under lane five of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex continued to wage their war against us with tiny bodies and tinier weapons . citizens are urged to protect themselves against this army in their midst by stomping everywhere they go , and keeping a vigilant watch towards the ground rather than keeping our eyes closed as we usually do . in related news , the city council has erected a monument to the fallen apache track er – that hero who died for the welfare of us all . the monument will be dedicated in a secret silent ceremony , attended by no one , and the monument itself will be buried in the desert where no one will find it – because he was also a racism embarrassment and we do not want our town associated with that kind of thing . and now , the community calendar . monday will be the annual bluegrass festival , held in the burned-out shell that used to be louie black ' s music shop , before he lit it on fire and skipped town with the insurance money . participants can huddled among the ashen remains , casting hunting looks at each other and sharing some of their favorite bluegrass dirges . legend has it that if you look into a mirror and say absolutely nothing three times , louie himself will appear and teach the crowd some simple , easy bluegrass licks – before taking your soul back with him into the dark of the mirror . tuesday is a holiday . make sure you have adequate emergency supplies and plenty of clear plastic sheet ing . we ' re not sure which holiday it is , so have all possible antidotes on hand . wednesday , the staff of dark owl records are getting a band together . ` ` we know a lot about music , '' they ' ll say , grabbing knives and hammer . ` ` we should start a band , definitely ! '' they ' ll continue , over the screams . ` ` let ' s get a band together . we should do that ! '' thursday through sunday will be a blur of routine and practicalities – a series of moments and actions that we will fail to notice as we experience them , and will forget the moment they are gone . this has been the community calendar . all right ! boring stuff done . back to the date ! we wrapped up dinner at gino ' s with a slice of their special invisible , non-corporeal , and tasteless carrot cake , which was as light as air and resembled air in all other qualities as well . our waiter , formerly a heaviest man with a large mustache , was now a buzzing shadow man defined only by the absence of light in the vague shape of a tarso and limbs . presumably , our former waiter was on break . we asked for the check , and then made our escape from the doorless room by breaking the window , using the brick our waiter had provided for that purpose . carlos and i – oh , the magic of that phrase , oh , the ecstasy that a simple conjunction can imply – took a stroll through mission grove park . it was just us , and the trees , and the crowd of our fellow citizens who were all doing the usual recreational activity of pointing at the sky and shouting in terror . i asked carlos if he wanted to join in for a round , but he said he had already been scared of all that the empty sky implies yesterday , and so was pretty tired . ` ` if you want , '' he said , ` ` we could do some tests on the trees . i ' ve been meaning to do some scientific tests on the trees . they seem normal , but given all that i ' ve observed in this town , it is a significant chance that they are not . '' well , of course i could not pass up the opportunity to perform real science side by side with my carlos ! and so we approached the nearest tree ; an old sagging thing , and began to perform tests – the nature and purpose of which i am not remote ly qualified to describe . meanwhile , our fellow park goes had ceased screaming and had taken up being strange , buzzing shadow beings . all of them were standing exactly where they had been , but were now defined only by the absence of light in the vague shape of a tarso and limbs . i stroked carlos ' cheek . i do not know if he noticed . he said the tests were inconclusive , and also was perfect in face and form . and now , a word from our sponsors . looking for a home security solution ? good luck with that ! want to feel safe when driving your car ? get in line ! fearful when walking alone at night ? well , you should be . when life seems dangerous and unmanageable , just remember that it is , and that you ca not survive forever . den ny ' s restaurant – why not ? and now a station editorial . listeners , a lot has been made about the topic of beauty . and i do not think we , in the media , always do our best to promote healthy self images . moves and magazines and to shows and advertisers love to use photo and video editing to make people seem skinnier , fairer , and more appealing to a false ideal of human beauty , and i think this takes a strong hold of us – especially children . but remember : you are beautiful only when you do beautiful things . full lips are not as beautiful as a full laugh . skinny hips are not as attractive as a quick wit . think about treating others right , and those others will flock to you in screaming droves . just pe el back those artificial layers , night vale ! un zip that name brand coat , those skinny jeans , wipe off that make up and gently ( but very quickly ) pe el off that skin that ' s covering up the true you . look at those exposed eyes , dangling protected from their gaping sockets . look at the blood and sinew slowly un coiling from quivering bones . admire that slippery viscera trying to squeeze under those dynamic ribs of yours . you are organic to be sure , listener ! be proud of who you are ! speaking of pride , speaking of beauty , more from my date soon . but first , the weather . let ' s get right back into it , shall we ? after the park , i drove him back to his lab next to big rico ' s pizza . the drive was ... difficult , because at this point it seemed that everyone in town but the two of us had hoped onto the buzzing shadow entity ' train , and were loping around town as malevolent holes in our reality , emanating an energy that made the hairs on your arm stand and your bowels vibrated . or maybe that was just the chemistry with carlos i was feeling . a woman ran at our car , screaming , a few of the shadow people chasing her , but before i could even touch the brake , she must have changed her mind because she had already turned into a shadow person herself . it ' s like , ugh , run from the shadow people or become one . make up your mind , lady ! we arrived outside of big rico ' s , and there was that awkward moment at the end of every date , where you pause outside of the person ' s door , and it ' s like , should i call the city council and submit the standard end-of-date report or ... are you going to ? ' also , i was wondering if he was going to invite me into his lab to look at all those beakers and humming electrical equipment . ` ` well , '' he said , pointing to his lab , ` ` this is me . '' ` ` uh-huh , '' i said . ` ` i should probably do something about this buzzing shadow ' thing , '' he said . ` ` a few experiments , to see if i can save the town . '' ` ` oh ? '' i said . ` ` do you need any help with that ? '' ` ` no , '' he said . ` ` a scientist is self-reliant . it ' s the first thing a scientist is . '' ` ` oh , '' i said again , but softer , sadder – which is when he leaned forward and kissed me . just once . just ... gently . just before slipping out of the car and into the lab . i ' ll tell you , listeners , i was almost swallowed by a cloud of malevolent shadow energy on the drive home and i hardly even noticed . i was so happy ! i guess carlos managed to find a way to defeat the shadow energy , as everything seems normal today . a couple neighborhoods are emptied out , sure , with books and food and television left where they had been at the time of the sudden vanishing , a tableaux of the life that never again will be . but it would not really be a weekend without that happening somewhere , right ? night vale , my sweet and only night vale , may you find love . may you find it wherever it ' s been hidden . may you find who has been hiding it and exact revenge upon them ! as the old song goes , love is all you need to destroy your enemies . finer words were never chant ed . stay tuned next for efficiency hour with our own productivity expert : a reversed voice , underscored by hypnotics pulses . and , with all the love in my loving heart , and with a loving voice in a loving and terrifying world , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : production oversight by tore malatia , who is holding a small locket . he is not speaking , he d just like for you to touch the locket . his hand is twisted , his skin is forming into scales . just touch it once . just once , okay ?
WTNV|Summer Reading Program|1 August 2013|does it even matter how many living things you touch today , or where they all are now ? welcome to night vale . the summer reading program for children and tens has begun at the night vale public library . this comes as an alarming surprise , given that the program was abolished by the city council 30 years ago . though parents and teenager have asked on several occasions to reinstate the program , the city council has maintained its position , biting lack of taxpayer funds , the extreme danger posed by books , the peril of exposing children to librarian , and of course , the incident that precipitated the ban – which the town ' s older residents will refer to only as ` ` the time of knives . '' nevertheless , in a show of civic dedication ( or mindless bloodless , and they really are so similar ) , night vale ' s librarian have banded together in defiance of authority to reinstate summer reading . colourful posters with appealing statements like ` ` get into a good book this summer , '' and ` ` we are going to force you into a good book this summer , '' and ` ` you are going to get inside this book , and we are going to close it on you and there is nothing you can do about it '' have appeared overnight around the library entrance and in local shops and business es – all sporting the clever tag line , ` ` catch the flesh-eating reading bacterium ! '' the sheriff ' s secret police have responded by interrogative the proprietors of business es where the posters have appeared , and by removing and confiscation the posters themselves . although ... to be honest , listeners , the graphics design work is really cut e . i mean , have you seen them ? the little flesh-eating germ , with his sun hat and library book , using a screaming semi-skeletal human victim as a beach chair ? ugh ! adorable ! after fierce debate today , the city council has officially declared murder illegal – a crime that has , until this point , been handled using informal vigilante squad . the head of one such squad , vincent large of grab ‘ em and sack ‘ em , argued that night vale has gotten along just fine for years , without the government ` ` meddling in murder investigation or punishment . '' ` ` do we sometimes catch the wrong guy ? '' said vincent . ` ` sure , most of the time . we ' re not even sure we ' ve ever caught a guilty one . usually , we just grab the first person we see . one time , we tried to arrest the dead body ... but it got away . '' opponents of the bill argued that most things in night vale are already illegal anyway , so citizens would hardly even notice the change . the law goes into effect in two weeks , and citizens are advised to get any necessary murders done before then – although there will be a three-day grace period after the deadline , for those who are forgetful , or whose victims are hard to catch . some summer tips to beat the heat : first off , have you tried to reason with the heat ? humans , temperatures , angels , and chairs are all equally real and sentiment – which is to say that we ' re all not real , nor are any of us actually sentiment . but give reason a shot . it has never , not once in history worked , but it might just work this time ! if the heat wo not listen to reason , try denying that it ' s hot . ` ` does not seem hot today , '' you might say to your profusely sweating neighbor . ` ` a little chilly even , '' you could continue , slipping on a sweat er and making an exaggerated ` ` br r ! '' noise as the glaring sun plants the idea of cancer in your skin . and , if denial does not work , then your best bet – as with all problems in life – is exhausted resignation . this has been summer tips to beat the heat . and now a public service announcement : here is a brief list of everything that is helpful : the sheriff ' s secret police clouds anger the city council affection falling just short of love ceiling fan s lungs other sundry organs laws government helicopter the 2005 hon da accord secrets whispers ultimately , nothing anything not specifically named in this list should be considered not-helpful and potentially dangerous . it ' s not just good sense , it ' s the law ! an update on the summer reading situation : 14 young people between the ages of 5 and 17 have already been reported missing , and are feared to be in the public library , and possibly learning . attempts by the sheriff ' s secret police to enter the library , rescue the missing children , and put an end to all summer reading activities have failed , as all doors and windows have mysteriously disappeared from the library exterior – just like it was before the renovation . our tax dollars paid for those doors and windows , and we should not be expected to stand for library administrators just deciding to disappear them on a whim – even for a valid reason , like jealously guarding their possession of our stolen children , without at least putting the issue to a popular vote . anyway ... in light of this development , the city council has declared a level orange fear alert . they advise that all night vale citizens avoid the public library , and provide the council with any information they may have on the whereabouts of the missing children , on librarian ' secret weaknesses , or on good books they ' ve read lately . any citizens who admit to having read good books , the council added in an impromptu press conference , televised from a book-proof bunker , will be immediately schedule for re-education , and subsequent de-education . the sheriff ' s secret police , meanwhile , have instituted a curfew for the entire town , effective immediately . after 7 p.m. , all minors should be at home and under adult supervision , and absolutely no reading , searching , online information seeking , educational games , documentary television , or having a sidelong love of learning will be permitted . as their catch new slogan puts it , ` ` once it gets dark , forget everything you ever knew and be silent . words belong to our enemies , and our enemies are words . so be as mute and pure as a bone bleached clean by our desert sun . by our desert sun . '' the police have also stated that any night vale citizen encountering a librarian , an entity suspected of being a librarian , or any excessively organized and helpful individual with a working comprehension of information systems is encouraged to shoot on sight . they also added this goes for teachers as well , since ` ` what the hell , as long as we ' re at it ! '' we ' ll have further up dates on this story as it develops . and now a word from our sponsors : congratulations ! you are eligible for a free 30-day trial ! this free 30-day trial comes with everything you need , including a free arrest , free charges , free arrangement , and free conviction , guaranteed ! shipping and handling not included . defense lawyer also not included . we have you surrounded . the more you struggle , the worse it will be for you . put that down . put it down ! put that down . this message brought to you whether you like it or not . the freemasons have announced some changes to their hierarchy . these changes are the following : whereas before the freemasons were under the authority of the stonemasons worldwide , they will now be an independent subsidiary of the hallo wed mason council , which itself will be split into four branches , corresponding with the four directions we glance when nervous . the hallo wed mason council will also provide guidance and financial support to the retail masons , the wholesale masons , and the discount masons – except in cases involving inter-masonry disputes , which will , as before , be subject to the small brotherhood of the large chamber , the large brotherhood of the small chamber , or the properly-fitted brotherhood , depending on the patterns discerned in bones , cast by a fully licensed member of the masonic drone legion , or one of their proxies . now , of course , the masons will continue their proud fraternal associations with the illuminati . however , the illuminati will itself be splitting into ten distinct factions as follows : red , green , eagle , faction four , the real illuminati , the other real illuminati , red again , alpha , winding , and hungry man brand frozen foods officially-sponsored illuminati . this split will be overseen by the council of three , which will be supported by the council of five , and monitor by the council of zero . elections for the council of zero will be held never and will result in nothing . discretionary funds for the illuminati and freemason alliance committee will be tunneled through a number of secret bank accounts , their numbers known to no one and their secrets kept forever . all of this is in accordance with the general secret agreement of the general secret alliance of the general secret community , representing all brotherhoods and organizations obscure and hidden , including the harpoon league , the flying cape , the six ancient truths , and the dental underground . the freemasons would also like to remind you that none of this may be known to you , and that they are only telling you this to demonstrate your fragile mind , which barely passed the words as they were spoken , and have already forgotten the secrets contained just moments later . you will never know anything , and you will not even know that . breaking news : despite the best efforts of the sheriff ' s secret police and citizens , we have received confirmation that over 100 children and adolescents have disappeared from their homes , beds , part-time jobs , or summer forced-labor camps , and are now presumed to be inside the night vale public library , and subject to the summer reading program . unfortunately , it is my sad duty to announce that this includes inter paolo – a high school junior who ' s been helping to organize the radio station archives over the summer months . to the parents and family of paolo : our hearts go out to you in this time of fear and uncertainty , as in all other times of fear and uncertainty , which is all of them , really . may you find comfort in the knowledge that , though your son may have been lost in a library , at least he – unlike many of his peers – actually went inside one of those at least once . the situation has – ... wait . hold on just one moment . i beg your pardon , listeners , but i ' ve just received alarming news . an alert citizen has called in to report inhuman shrieking , thick meat sounds , and a coppery , rotten smell of go re and viscera coming from the now-sealed and impenetrable night vale public library – which are , of course , all fairly standard elements of the summer reading program as described in the library director ' s original proposal . painful though it may be , it seems that all we can do now – as so often in our dull blinkered lives below a microcosm of horror and beauty – is wait . wait , and hope , and know that our hopes are material and powerless , and our wishes will go unheard by the indifferent multitude of stars , if indeed they ( the stars ) are even real . but there are still some comforts that remain to us while we wait . small , shining baubles to distract us from the endless march of time towards events we have no control over and outcome we never imagined . and so , ladies and gentlemen , i give you the weather . this just in , listeners : we ' ve received reports that the entrances to the night vale public library have reappeared , and the missing children have begun to emerge from inside the building . the children have been described as wild-eyed , fera , some staggering upright , and some running on all fours like animals , caked in effluvia and far more emaciated than the time of their absence would seem to account for ... but otherwise , well , healthy , and unarmed . at the head of the dazed and shambling pack was their apparent chosen leader , 12-year-old tamika lynn – her mouth clenched in a blood-crusted snarl , and carrying the severed head of a librarian in one hand , and a gore-streaked stick er chart in the other . eye witnesses who dared to get close enough to read the chart reported that tamika had even finished ` ` cry , the beloved country , '' which is very impressive for her reading level . well done , tamika ! indeed , congratulations are in order for all the young people of night vale who participated in the summer reading program , for proving that neither abduction nor captivity , neither horrors beyond imagining nor unfamiliar vocabulary can prevent you from embracing the pleasures of belles-lettres . here ' s to you , boys and girls , and remember : even while we congratulate tamika for winning your loyalty with her sophisticated comprehension and extremes of berserker violence , that the real victory won today has been for literacy . stay tuned next for our countdown of last words , from ` ` stop telling me how to drive '' all the way to ` ` it ' s okay . it ' s okay . it ' s okay . '' good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : a bar walks into a bar . the bar tender is a snake eating its own tail . the windows look out only onto the face of the one who looks .
WTNV|Subway|15 August 2013|our black sun s move erratically , like drunken bees , and each of them stings . now , more than ever , we are full of blood and honey . welcome to night vale . we start our program with some good news , listeners . several night vale residents have reported seeing subways entrances popping up all over town . these brightly lit stairwells into the underground have been showing up on several street corners over the past few days . but the secret police have denied knowledge of any subways system . according to our station ' s research into the issue , there are no records of the night vale transit authority ever creating a subways system . or getting one approved . or even having discussed building one . nor has there ever existed a night vale transit authority . the only hints can be found in the brochure glittering the entrances , describing the ease with which we will now com mute , the hungers we will sate , the time we will travel , the times we will travel , the happy memories we will never be able to shake loose – even when we wake up screaming . i ' m looking at one of the new subways brochure right now . there is no lo go , just smiling faces , with teeth – unusual in their shapes , colors , and pacing , but otherwise quite normal-looking teeth – and the phrase , ` ` oh , the place you will go ! '' written in heavy sans serf font across the eyes of smiling train riders , clutching tightly to bags and metal rails and each other . i ' m looking more closely at these transit brochure , and the paper stock is quite strange , listeners . the pages are scaly , brown , and translucent . i mean , i usually just have inter dylan make our radio station flyers on colored copy paper ( say , a 24-pound golden rod ) , but these brochure are so lush , like wings of a majestic insect . the text also just grows increasingly marbled . for instance : here , it says that our new subways system will streaming the rush hour com mute . but about halfway down , it ' s a series of nearly indecipherable glyphs our experts insist hint at non-euclidean emotions and appeasement . though we think this may be a euphemism for ` ` fares . '' finally , there ' s a crudely-drawn map of our new transit system , all routes resembling spasm ing tentacles and all passing at least once through a common point deep beneath the center of night vale . no one yet knows where the subways came from or where they go to . but as a city dweller , i am certainly happy to hear that night vale is embracing mass transit . this is a fantastic way to uncle our highways , reduce pollution and accidents – and , most importantly , subways allow us to interact with each other . make eye contact . acknowledge each other as fellow creatures . cars are impersonal machines that close us off from humanity , and with the rising cost of gas and the large iridescent tongues that have been growing from route 800 , i think the subways will be a positive addition to our community . we ' ll have more on this breaking story soon . ladies and gentlemen , i want to talk to you now about a popular new service in town that delivers feelings – whether you want them or not . this service has no name or contact information , it simply delivers feelings . you do not choose the feeling , though yelp reviews say ` ` tingling horror '' and ` ` as though electrocuted , i stood before him '' are the most popular so far . it is unclear where on yelp you look for these reviews . i myself have received a few feelings so far – such as ` ` blood feu d '' and ` ` frustrated origami novice '' – and i ' m looking forward to receiving more . i ' m crossing my fingers for ` ` should have left the party hours ago before i could disappoint her . '' i would also settle for ` ` overcast wednesday '' and ` ` trampled by horses . '' this is my own endorsement , listeners , not a sponsored ad . i would not even know which company or person to bill for air time . i just really enjoy having feelings delivered straight to me without having to worry about choosing which feeling , and why , and when . the secret police , in cooperation with a vague , yet menacing , government agency , would like to remind you that here in night vale , no one is eating each other . they remind you that this is a friendly reminder . the secret police added their assurance that they see no reason to alert us to the not-at-all increasingly-common practice of gr ill parties and consensus cannibalism . ` ` it d be pretty terrible of us to conceal that , right ? '' a heavily croaked spokesperson said , distractedly , deeply engrossed in a game of drop7 on his or her phone 4s . ` ` but listen ! the important thing here is that we are not – hang on ... darn ! warning or averting anyone , and i think you should remember to thank us for that . '' the croaked figure then double-tapped his or her phone and a horse rose up from the floor beneath him or her , and they flew off into the sky . the city council has now officially denied any involvement in our fantastic new subways system . we have this direct from a fair-haired and hollow-eyed child they ' ve sent with the denial tattooed on his inner lip . ` ` never approved , '' it reads . just a quick aside , listeners , we ' ll get back to the subways news in a moment , but ... would anyone like a child ? because i ' m never quite sure what to do with the messenger children the city council sends us ? i ' m not even sure if the child is completely ... sentiment . this one just stares blandly ahead , and ... oh ! no pe ! no , he ' s wandered off . never mind ! also , we ' re getting reports that a press conference was just held in front of the ashen shell of the public library – which of course was burned down last night , and it ' s only a matter of days until we ' ll need to burn it down again . several masked figures , having called the press conference , claimed responsibility for the subways system . their masks have the countenance of very concerned deer . one of the figures spoke to reporter . ` ` we took the matters into our own hand , even without approval . we do not need approval of the city council or the mayor , '' the spokesperson explained . ` ` we do and say what we please . that shirt looks awful on you , by the way . '' apparently here they pointed to night vale weekly gazette writer lauren james , who usually wears very nice shirts ... it ' s really her bangs that do not work , uh , i think . i mean , i like bangs , but they just frame her face too dramatically , especially with those thick-rimmed glasses . press conference attended said they could see something moving behind the spokesperson ' s deer mask . i am told that the black-charred grounds of the library are covered in reaches as well . also , that perhaps the deer masks are not concerned , but disapproving , or maybe merely world-weary and under a lot of stress . listeners , i am now being told by a different dead-eyed child in my studio , via a complex facial expressions , that if you are anywhere near the site of last night ' s victorious fire at the library , please do not step on the reaches . we recognize that there are tens of thousands of these ver min , but we ' ve been informed by inside sources – and this really un settling zombie child – that these are proprietary reaches . if you look closely at one of the many cockroaches crawling up your arm , you ' ll notice that they have slogans scrawled across them . um , ` ` ride the trains , '' ` ` everything is fine , '' ` ` tenderize yourself as needed . '' we repeat : do not hurt the reaches . we are receiving several reports that the reaches are precious ad space . and , if you hold one up to your ear , it ' s true ! they sound like ... sizzling butter . and now a look at the financial markets . you will turn yourself inside out . your sadness will know no bounds . ladybugs will flee you , wolves run wild in you . you will hear the wind chimes like shatter ing . the sun will drip ich or . whatever peace you find will be taken from you . nothing will be the same . nothing has ever been the same . ` ` past performance does not guarantee future results , '' you will whisper to the rising moon , as you hear several foxes fleeing your vicinity . this has been business news . the greater night vale medical community would like to remind you to become an organ donor . it ' s a simple process that only takes a moment , and you could save a life ! you can visit the dmv to pick up the appropriate form . it only requires that you check a box , sign your name , and turn it in . the greater night vale medical community would also like to say thank you to those citizens who have already become registered organ donors . they remind you that collection begins this tuesday at 4:00pm . please hold still , and wear loose-fitting clothing that day . they also advise that you do not eat anything after 8:00 the night before . they are particularly in need of kidneys and skin . a representative was quoted as saying something that resembled a hiss , and then quickly biting the reporter ' s ankle . it has come to our attention that some night vale residents are getting off the trains ... transformed . mayor pamela mitchell described these computers are ` ` thinner somehow , spiritually , like you think it ' s the afternoon but it ' s almost evening . that ' s what they ' re like . '' carlos – ca ring and reliable carlos the scientist – thinks maybe the riders ' d na has been washed out . emptied . completely drained of its contents . listeners , i ' m also being told that some people are not getting off the trains at all . i ' m looking out my studio window now and see a new subways entrance has just appeared across the street during this very broadcast . i have seen dozens enter and few exit those stairs . i have grave concerns , night vale . i have just been handed a press release by another small child . he has ... such deep , blue eyes and so many freckled , he is ... smiling , and there is something dark moving behind his teeth . the press release is covered in reaches . now the boy is leaving , and i hear a rapid but faint click ing sound . according to the release , the city council says we owe today ' s increased productivity to our glorious new mass transit system that just appeared this week . it goes on to say that night vale could eventually become a true travel destination , like japan or brazil or singapore or luftnarp or svitz . i know we still do not understand who built the subways or where it goes or what has happened to all of our family and friends that have gotten on the train today . i know there are ... concerns , night vale . but this subways seems to be a major step forward for our town , for our environment , for our – dear . something is happening , listeners . uh ... this does not appear to be a standard government-created earthquake . across the street , there are shimmering waves of heat curling the air above the subways entrance . a ... a black cloud of large insects is swirling above . i do not know what this means , night vale , and since inter dylan never returned from his errands ( likely because i told him to take the new subways to save time ) , i myself must go investigate . in the mean time , i give you the weather . it ' s spring somewhere , night vale , and i must admit the last few minutes – even stretched as they were seemingly into eons – have left me feeling renewed , returned as i am to my home after so long away . it ' s like i ' m walking into fresh , clean water ... even as i lean into the mi c . i entered the subways , like many of you , and like many of you other riders , i saw and felt the comic suffering of millennium – was witness to er as of countless births and deaths and wars and discoveries and kisses and plagues and knives and cold , empty void . i saw it all at once , and i could not make sense of any of it . but i understood it fully , and it took years , night vale . years . i have been missing you since i left you to the weather . what was the weather like then ? how much time has passed for you ? only four minutes ? ? what of the ground-shaking and the cloud of insects and the immense heat ? well ... that ' s apparently what happens when an express train arrives . people hurrying to faraway , long-away destination . the click-click-click of rush hour commuted . reading unimportant news stories . solving unimportant number puzzles . looking up briefly to give seats to the elderly or inform . all the while , not knowing where they were going or why or what terrible things they would never unknown upon choosing to com mute through whatever that singular point below our city is . that intersect ion of space and time . a sort of ... navel of the universe . and somehow we are all better , wiser , kinder for going where we went for as long as we were gone – though we did not age but a few moments . we still do not know who the deer-masked transit people are , or whether they are people at all . perhaps they are thousands of reaches packed inside a business suit , hiding behind a mask . or perhaps the mask was not hiding them at all , but hiding us – shelter ing them from our immature , solipsistic minds . but now , there is a subways . now we can go anywhere , and perhaps we can know anything if we ride for long enough . listeners , there ' s another child in the studio . this one is careless , covered in denis and dust , with a long swoop of unduly brown hair covering what would be the right eyebrow . the child is holding a handwritten note . it reads : ` ` because of construction , all subways service is suspended until further notice . for your convenience , free scuttle bu ses will be provided . at the moment of greatest despair and hopelessness , when you least expect it , a scuttle bus will come to you . thank you for your patience . '' the future of urban planning is here , night vale . and , like our own imminent future , it is buried in the earth . stay tuned next for a swarm of flies curling a hot mi c . and as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : your body is a temple . a temple of blood rituals and pagan tributes . a lost temple . a temple that needs more calcium . you should maybe try vitamin supplement .
WTNV|Dana|1 September 2013|it takes heart . it takes gut s . it also takes cash . it just needs your payment immediately . welcome to night vale . mayor pamela mitchell announced again today that she is stepping down as mayor later this year . this is the fourth announcement this week . she said again , through tight teeth , that this is totally her call and was never ever discussed in a room with no windows , by small men wearing large pelts and decorative soft meat crowns . ` ` that is not how we do things , '' she said . ` ` that is not how we do things , '' she whispered . ` ` that is not how we do things ! '' she mouthed silently , as a single dark red tear formed in the corner of her eye , and then slowly rolled down her taut olive cheek and onto her clay-stained smock . elections for a new mayor will be held at some later time . when asked by the press for a specific date and location , masked representatives from a vague , yet menacing , government agency purred loudly . they then began rubbing their sides against the journalists ' legs . several reporter began sneering . listeners , many of you recall our station inter dana who , while reporting on strange goings-on , was locked in the forbidden dog park back in april . i ' ve received occasional texts and e mails from dana , but then this morning , well ... let ' s listen . cecil , it ' s dana . i found a way out of here . i walked the parameter of the dog park looking for a crack or a hole or a weak spot in the obsidian walls . i never found an opening , but ... this is very strange . the walls just keep going ! if you stand still , the dog park seems to take up a single city block , but ... i walked one direction for about two weeks , and i could no longer see the monolith where i started . or the people i was with . or even hear the trefoil rustling of the leaves from the tall , black metal trees that protect us from clouds . there ' s something else . i found a door . an old oak door , standing supported by any other structure . i did not know if it was an exit from the dog park or an entrance to something much worse , but ... i went through it . now i am in some old house . cecil , i can hear someone moving around upstairs . i need to go . i will try to call you soon . thank you for everything , and i hope our time and place match again soon . oh , listeners ! i so wish i could have talked to dana this morning ! they were showing cat ballot again on tbs and i just could not break away . i tried to call dana back , but my phone caught briefly on fire , and something sharp cut open my thumb as i selected her number . and now a public service announcement from the night vale sca . thinking about getting a dog ? dogs are not only great family companions , but also help childhood development . by regularly feeding , walking , fighting , denying the existence of , and ultimately soul-merging with the family dog , young children learn about responsibility , empathy , and pyrokinesis . there are , of course , some breeds of dogs that are not right for children . those breeds include spider wolves , double wolves , switch-bladed mountain dogs , secret terriers , flesh-eating spaniels , pit viper , and table saws . visit the sca for more information on the right dog for your family . hello ? dana ? cecil ? i can barely understand you . cecil , are you there ? yes , i ' m here ! dana , are you still in the old house ? no , i ' m still in the old house . i made my way out of the basement , which was empty except for a single photograph of a lighthorse . it ' s a framed 5x7 black and white photo of this old lighthorse . it hangs crooked just to the right of center on one wall . the lighthorse in the photo looks to be in the middle of a field . there ' s no water . why would there be a lighthorse not near the water ? i have no idea ! no , that does not sound right . maybe it ' s some other reason . anyway , once i heard the footsteps above me stop , i opened the door to the first floor . i saw a man standing in the middle of the living room , staring straight ahead at the wall . i could not see his face , cecil , and i knew that i had been through this moment before ... not like de ja vu , more like a clear but fleeting memory of a dream . i was scared he might hear me , cecil . what did you do , dana ? yes , that ' s exactly what i did ! i got up the nerve and i spoke to him . i said , ` ` hello sir , my name is dana and i ' m sorry to intrude , but i was wondering ... is this your home ? '' and he did not move . he did not make a sound . he just kept staring at another small photo on the wall . i walked closer to him and i said , ` ` excuse me , sir . excuse me , but – '' and then i saw . cecil , i saw who it was ! who was it ? no , it was not her . it was john peters – you know , the farmer ? and he was staring at this photo , and i walked closer and said , ` ` john , it ' s me , dana ! '' but he did not respond . i looked at the photo he was examining and it was just a picture of a window – a worn driftwood frame inside of which was a photograph of a worn driftwood pane with gently warped glass . i could not see what was beyond the window in the photo , but there was a shape . maybe a tree ? maybe a person ? john just stared ahead looking sad . no , not sad . concerned . he looked concerned . i did not say another word to him . i waved my hand gently in front of his eyes , and he did not notice me . i tried to touch his shoulder , but my hand went right through him ! like through a cold wind ! he was not even there , cecil ! he eventually turned and looked at another photo on another wall of another window , but he never saw or heard me . this home has no furniture , no furnishing , no belongings – only photo . single , small photo on occasional walls . most of them are windows – different windows with different panes in different photo frames . the house itself , i realize , has no windows of its own , so ... i do not really know if there is a basement or a first or second floor . the upstairs is the downstairs is the ground floor . but i know one thing , cecil . what is that ? no , but you ' re close . i know that john peters entered through a door in the kitchen . i can see the door right now , cecil . it is open , and beyond that door is sunlight . i can see sunlight and sand . i ' m going through . yes ! dana , do that ! go through the door now ! go through that door ! i ' m sorry , cecil , you make a good point , but i have to go through that door , no matter what ! i ' ve got to get back home ! do it , dana . yes ! here i go ! dana ? hello ? dana , can you hear me ? ladies and gentlemen , i do not know where dana has gone now . i do hope that we hear from her again . i would try to call her back , but my phone has grown ... spiny legs and is crawling away now . if you are the type to pray , please pray for dana ' s safe return home to night vale . if you are not the type to pray , please know that you are violating several laws , and you will receive a knock on your door from armed agents very soon . let ' s have a look at sports . this weekend , the night vale high school scorpions kick off their season against the pine cliff high school liza rd monitor . scorpions quarter back senior michael sandero had off-season surgery to remove the second head he grew in the middle of last season ' s division title run . michael ' s mother , flora sandero , said she had her son ' s original head removed instead , as she liked the new head much better . ` ` this new head ' s much handsomer and does not talk back as much , '' flora explained from the roof of the pinkberry , where she was install ing several long pikes with dead cultures and rodent on the ends . ` ` this new head only speaks russian , so i do not have to listen to him on the phone with his girlfriend all night long , and he does not ho g the television because he does not understand any of the english or spanish programs here . he ' s a better boy now , '' she said , jamming another pike into the roof of the trend fro-yo store , before yelling skyward , causing the spare clouds to part quickly , revealing a giant floating crystal glowing faintly red in the mid-afternoon sun . and now , a word from our sponsor . macdonald ' s wants to remind you that the most important meal of the day is breakfast . so why would you let a morning go by without staring deeply into the mirror until you no longer recognize the face staring back at you – mimicking your every gesture , mocking your every movement ? how else will you get the energy you need for a full day ' s work or recreation if you are not silently screaming into the visage of a man or woman who gives you such uneasy spirit , such unshakable terror , a qu easy feeling every time you make the connection between what that thing is and what you are becoming ? what you have become ? where does the void end ? where do you end ? when do you end ? what time is it now ? you are late for work ! you are lying on your bathroom floor , half-dressed in a cool sludge of toothpaste and hair g el . you ' ve been crying , but for how long ? macdonald ' s . i ' m loving ' ! listeners , i just received word from carlos – lovely carlos , with his perfect teeth and hair and ... pen chant for sometimes chewing a little more loudly than is preferred – carlos , who is with other scientists at the desert creek housing development . for the past year , carlos has been studying a house that does not exist . it seems like it exists , like it ' s just right there when you look at it , and it ' s between two identical houses , so it would make more sense for it to be there than not ... but it does not exist . carlos said the scientists asked him to come over and ring the doorbell , just to see what would happen . they offered him five dollars but he turned it down , saying something about scientific integrity and bah bah bah . but i ' m like , five dollars is a ta co lunch at jerry ' s ta cos , so , whatever , rich guy ! carlos said that before he could take a step to the house , a woman emerged from the side door talking on her cell phone . he and the scientists ran up to the woman , calling out to her as she walked , quickly , away from the house . she looked panicked . no , not panicked . concerned . she looked concerned , carlos said . she kept talking on her cell phone , never responding to them . carlos said she kept walking until she walked right through them , right through the scientists , like she were a cold wind . and then , she stopped talking into her phone , stared back toward the house , and with a look of panic – no , with a look of concern – ran away . carlos said – and this is very strange – carlos said , ` ` it sounded like the person she was talking to was you , cecil ! '' listeners , i do not know where or when dana is , but i am going to sit by this phone and wait for her call . i know she is all right . i hope she is all right . i fear she is not all right . with great anxiousness – no , concern . with great concern , i take you now to the weather . first saved message : cecil , i ' m sorry i lost your call . i made it out of the door , out of the empty house and its empty photographs into an empty desert , and i do not know if anything has improved . i can see nothing but endless sand and a single distant mountain – a mountain i have never seen , because i do not believe in mountains . but there is a mountain , and there is a tiny red light up on the mountain , intermittently blinking . as i exit ed the house , the door shut behind me and now it ' s gone . as i walked , i moved through something that was not there . i heard voices through digital static , and felt a cold wind across my body . the others are here , but not here , cecil . what , or who , did i just walk through ? cecil , something is coming . you can feel it in the ground , something very large is coming . i ' ve got ta go . i will call when i can , and tell my mother and brother i am out of the dog park and i am safe . for now . thank you , cecil . end of message . oh , listeners , i wish i had more news than this . i wish my phone would have rung , i wish i could have had that conversation instead of another voice mail . i wish dana were home , safe . i wish i could feel something other than overwhelming concern . no , not concern – uncertainty . i wish a lot of things . but , as the old saying goes , if wishes were horses , those wishes would all run away shrieking and buck ing , terrified of a great unseen evil . so instead , what i want to say is , i am thankful dana is out of the dog park . i am thankful i had my first conversation with her since poetry week . i am thankful carlos did not ring that doorbell . i am thankful that people listen to this show and the stories about our wonderful little community – the most scientific ally interesting community in america , as my carlos once said . and , of course , i am thankful for you , night vale . stay tuned next for loud shortage radio squelches , followed by a lifetime of tinnitus . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : look to the sky . you will not find answers there , but you will certainly see what everyone is screaming about .
WTNV|A Blinking Light up on the Mountain|15 September 2013|our god is an awe some god . much better than that ridiculous god that desert bluff has . welcome to night vale . there is , listeners , a blinking light up on the mountain . it is red . blinking lights are always red . it is nest led among the crags and nooks of the precipitous slope . we can all see it – no use denying it ! the city council tried . ` ` no pe , '' they said . ` ` blinking light ? let me think . blinking light ... no , sorry , it does not ring any bells ! '' but then a bell started ringing – a signal from the watchman who lives in night vale ' s invisible clock tower , letting us know that he had seen something . and we all saw it , too . it was a blinking light , up on the mountain . ` ` oh well , '' said the council , crawling backwards through a window into town hall , one by one . ` ` ah h , well ... it was worth a shot . '' what does this light mean ? who will dare investigate it ? will it spell our doom ? dear listeners , who knows ? no one . and probably , more later . for now , just this . just a blinking light – red – up on the mountain . harrison kip , adjunct professor of archaeology at night vale community college , announced an up coming three-part series on night vale community television – defending his fringe views that the pyramids , and other ancient structures , were constructed by human beings rather than benevolent ancient aliens . harrison , against decades of reasonable evidence , raved that ` ` it ' s possible that these historical marvels could have been made using mathematics and slave labor . '' he went on to explain , shrieking like an obvious lunatic , that agriculture was probably not started on mars , and that humanity was created through evolution , and not through selective breeding of alien d na . we reached out for comment to the president of night vale community college , sarah sultan – who is a smooth , fist-sized river rock – about the extreme beliefs expressed by a staff member . sarah had no comment , as she is a smooth , fist-sized river rock , and unable to speak . she can write , however , and wrote , ` ` no comment , '' before drawing an insulting caricature of your humble reporter – which was harmful , and unnecessary . listeners , here ' s something weird . i know you ca not see it , but it ' s sitting in the studio with me at this very moment , and it is definitely something , and definitely weird . i ' m not sure how it got here , but ... i ' m not sure how i got here either . causation is difficult and confusing . i have not tried touching it ... i ' m going to try touching it now . oh ! i believe it likes being touched , because it started to vibrated and lean in towards my body , but ... that could just be its way of expressing anger or immense physical suffering . when something is this weird , one should not assume to understand anything specific about it at all . is it a bomb ? is it one of those objects that is not a bomb ? is it just a kind of dog ? we do not know . and we will never find out . and we will never try to find out . ignorance may not actually be bliss , but it certainly is less work . so , with no new information and with nothing learned , i ' ll repeat what i said , gesturing at it with a hand you can not see . listeners , here ' s something weird . a continuation on our previous report about a blinking light up on the mountain : as many of you noted , the very nature of our report indicated the existence of a mountain – which is surprising , given that we live in vast , desert flatness . so yes , there is a mountain . let ' s start there . there is a mountain now , rising up out of the alluvial floodplain . it is made of rock , and height , and awe . its peak is higher than where i am now , but lower than the void . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , said that it was definitely a mountain , saying , ` ` that ' s a mountain if ever i seen one . i have not , though – seen one . i think that ' s what they ' re like . mountains are like that , right ? '' madeline fleur , head of the night vale tourism board , said , ` ` oh , great , now we ' re go n na have to re print all these brochure ! '' before taking more sip s of her coffee than she needed to in a given span of time – because the frequency of sip s was under her control , and her own life was not . john peters – you know , the farmer ? we have not heard form him in a while . if anyone knows where he went , or about the blinking light up on the mountain , or the mountain rising up out of this muddy plain outside of town , please call in to the station and release the information with your mouth . as part of our service to our community , night vale community radio is taking this moment to allow one of the candidates for mayor to make a brief statement . the following is from the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home : i replaced your books with other books . the covers are the same , but the content has been altered . i do not think you read enough , but that is not why i did it . i changed every single word of some of the books , in others only a single comma on a single page . this is a metaphor , but i ' m ... not sure what it represents . that is also a metaphor . we all are . our political system has become too complicated . i am not complicated . i ' m just a gentle old lady who lives in your home . i ' m touching your hand right now . no , not that one . not that one either . do not think you are superior because you have a face and i do not . all of your books are now different books and you did not notice . so who is a lost child in the dark howling woods of this fable ? anyway , i hope you ' ll vote for me . one of the books is now my life story , if you d like to know more about my background . no , not that one . not that one either . you ' ll know it , because my life story is just like yours – starting with calamity and shouting , and ending with an empty room and a to-do list . also , hiram mcdaniels has been exchanging e mails with corn lobbyists looking to elbow in on our local imaginary corn market . hiram : bad for our community , bad for our interests , literally a five-headed dragon . vote for the candidate you can trust . vote for the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . and now , a word from our sponsor : today ' s broadcast may have been brought to you ... by ... uncertainty . and now , back to our regular programming . ahahah ! we have some sharp listeners ! several of you noted that the strangeness of today does not end with the blinking light up on the mountain , or the mountain itself ... but also , this vast , muddy plain it rises from . so yes : we are now reporting that there is a great floodplain , strewn with bones , around our city . its wet patches glint slightly when the blinking light is illuminated . at night , when all distance is darkness , it appears that the universe itself is glimmer ing red , and then gone . red – and then gone . the mud nipples under the footsteps of the approaching masked army , and this warps the reflections in interesting ways . carlos says he would like to study it , but that he promised to make a certain person dinner , and he has to learn how to put other things besides science first . some of this realization might have come with help from those around him . mayor pamela mitchell was seen holding her official mayor al blood stone aloft towards the mountain , and the blinking light upon it . she was standing on that plain – the plain that exists now , which we should have mentioned earlier . in other news , a man in a ta n jacket , carrying a bearskin suitcase , was seen outside of one of the currently-closed subways entrances , passing out flyers explaining the benefits of a mass-transit system , and encouraging citizens to push for the reopening of the subways as soon as possible . ` ` transit is the opposite of traffic ! '' the fly er reportedly said , and ` ` subways ? more like iowa ! '' some citizens reported that the fly er went on to say , ` ` transverse the navel of the world , that secret buried point . it is my home . help me get home . it is already too late to be early , but not too late to be on time . '' here at the station , we ca not confirm any of this , as those holding the fly er soon found that it had vanished from their hands . that they could barely remember their interaction with the man . and that , looking back , all they saw was a haze of dust and heat – distant , and indecipherable – like a country they d never live to visit . like the landscape of a fading dream . like fiction . like fiction . all right , we ' re really go n na get it right this time . we have been focus ing too narrowly , and we realize that . as many of you pointed out , we should have spent less time on the blinking light , and more time expanding on the bit about the approaching masked army . so : there is now a great masked army coming towards us across the bone-covered plain . we have no specific information about them , other than that they look small when far away , and then appear to grow as they come closer , which they are – coming closer . they also might actually be growing . they are quite large now . the blinking light up on the mountain has not changed its pace . there is a noise like growling , only less organic – like wind howling through a canyon , only more ... growled . ladies and gentlemen , here is what we know : there is a blinking light up on the mountain . there is a mountain on the floodplain . there is a floodplain under the imminent army . there is an imminent army maybe a couple of hours ' march from here . i do not believe , now , that we are leaving anything out . if you have homes , i suggest you flee them . if you have friends , i suggest you warn them . if you have children ... did you not know how dangerous and predictable the world was when you created a defenseless , tiny human within it ? and , much like madeline fleur , head of night vale ' s tourism board , i will now control the one part of my life that is under my control – let us go now ( and i do hope we come back ) , to the weather . well , we did come back . here we are , post-weather . carlos finally took a look at the situation : the blinking light up on the mountain , and all that came with it – horrific invading army , et cet era . ` ` oh that ? '' he said , gesturing with a scapula he had , until moments before , been using to cook . ` ` that ' s a mi rage . i ' ve seen that one before . when you get the clouds a certain way , and the temperature is where it ' s at , you can sometimes get this ... blinking-light-mountain-floodplain-masked-army mi rage . wo w ! this is a pretty strong one ! it should disappear in an hour or two . '' and it did ! completely gone ! well ... the mountain and the blinking light and the floodplain disappeared . the masked army turned out to be real . but they were not coming to attack us , just passing through on their way to attacking someone else . and they provided some valuable traffic for local business . a few of them even took a bus tour of ra don canyon . madeline fleur was both relieved and pleased . ` ` i ' m relieved , '' she said , ` ` i ' m also pleased . '' she was still sipping her coffee too often . perhaps her feeling of lack of control stems from a personal issue , rather than the impending doom we imagined . stress from her failure to live up to her own self-imposed life goals , for instance . or a relationship that was not exactly the relationship she had envisioned it would be . but who knows ? no one . no one has ever known anything , not really . still , nonetheless , we have come to another end . we have come to it as we always do : blind , ignorant , groping ... i take comfort in that consistency . there is no blinking light up on the mountain , there is no mountain towering over a muddy plain , there is no muddy plain under an invading army . there was an invading army , but they ' re gone now . what is left ? well , what is always left ? night vale . our little city . our tiny town , our night vale . proud . safe . existent . stay tuned next for the background hum of the universe – amplified , and with live color commentary . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : throw your hands in the air . now your arms . keep detaching limbs and throwing them in the air . hopefully the birds will be sa ted , and leave .
WTNV|Cookies|1 April 2014|welcome to night vale . thrilling news , listeners ! it has come to our attention that there will be cond os for sale right here in night vale ! details on them are a little hay – for instance , we do not know what these cond os will look like , where they will be located , who is building them , and what they will cost . but in the official brochure for the development , it does say in a thick , all-caps , black scrawl . one local reactor , speaking under the condition of anonymity , and from within the belly of a grazing deer , said that cond os are a great investment . ` ` invest your money in cond os , '' said the reactor . ` ` invest your time in cond os . invest your life . invest emotions and hope . invest your ideas about the future , invest your disappointment with your on going ‘ now . ' invest drops of blood . you lose blood all the time on frivolous accidents , now is your chance to imbued it with purpose and ver ve . spill your blood before the cond os ! '' the reactor was then cut off when the deer was spooked by a passing car and ran away . well . look , listeners . i do not know much about cond os . i do not know much about anything at all , honestly . but i do know this : cond os are coming to night vale . they will be for sale , and this is great and exciting news for us all ! and now for some more great and exciting news : the museum of forbidden technologies is proud to announce their new special exhibit : ` ` a startling and highly forbidden piece of technology brought to us by time travelers ... or ... ancient long-dead aliens ... or ... russians ... or whatever . '' the technology will be kept in a locked vault , which itself will be wrapped in thick , black bandages , with a hand-written sign tap ed to one side , saying only : your ticket includes a free audit guide , which will play a single piercing tone , designed to considerate ly remove you from the world of thought , and sound , and sentence . the museum of forbidden technologies . bring your kid s ! otherwise , something even worse might happen to them . well , it seems that just about half the town of night vale is lined up outside of the con do rental office , which is located in the abandoned gas station on oxford street , and everyone is there . janice rio ( from down the street ) , who was practically hopping up and down with excitement over owning a new con do , whatever a con do is , and whatever it looks like ; leann hart , publishing editor of the night vale daily journal , who was holding a blooded hatchet , in case she came across any baggers or online journalists who might threaten her grip on the printed word ; carlos the scientist ... carlos the scientist . he was there , wearing a business-casual lab coat , and analyzing those around him with complicated devices he could not explain , without eventually just shaking his head and muttering , ` ` ugh , science . '' u mm ... i do not know if i ' ve ever mentioned this on this show , by the way , but ... carlos is totally my boyfriend ! i just did not know if i had brought that up ? i do not ... um . hers he ' s very handsome , and – and into science , and he is learning to be better about calling when he needs to cancel dates to get some experiments done . where was i ? oh yes , ok . even the dreaded glow cloud was there , hurling dead animals down upon those in line and intending , to all that would listen , the sun will not set again on your lives ! all that you once were now belongs to me ! bury your face into the breast of the earth and worship that which you can not understand ! you know , it makes total sense that the glow cloud would want one of these cond os . i mean , after joining the school board , and sending your kid to the local school , you need to have a nice place at which to raise ... whatever strange and terrible creature it is that constitutes your family . no one could see into the abandoned gas station , so no one knew what the con do rental office looked like . there was only a bubbling , dark movement , like a pot of boiling squad ink , and the occasional pin point of light , like distant , dying stars . people began to shove each other , trying to catch a glimpse of what the cond os might be . there was shouting . roger singh started to point at every object in his sight – blades of grass , the hushed shell of a former gas pump , janice rio ( from down the street ) – asking , ` ` is that a con do ? is – is that a con do ? '' in a high , cracked voice . and ... all right , this is out of nowhere , i know , but ... at what point in a relationship do certain people think about living together ? is ... is this a ... buying a con do a sign that you want to move to that stage ? is that what an action like that might hypothetical be indicating ? oh , also , roger was holding a freshly-separated spine of an unknown animal or possible person , waving it at the bubbling dark window and howling , ` ` give me a con do ! what is a con do ? give me one ! will this buy me a con do ? '' as of press time , no one had told him whether a spine would buy him a con do . but , do you know what i mean ? like , could this be a sign that he wants to move things in that direction ? you know , i just wish he would communicate more directly sometimes , but scientists do not communicate directly . everybody knows that . they communicate using a series of obscure and arcade codes and signals . that is what is meant to be a scientist . and roger has started failing at people with the detached spine , and several people have been trampled , and it is still not known whether he will be able to buy a con do with the spine . probably not . let ' s talk about your health for a moment . let ' s concentrate on your health . let ' s think about your health . do you feel healthy ? pay close attention to your body and see if you feel as healthy as you thought . aah ? was that a slight tinge in the muscle of your arm ? that is a bad sign . that ' s a symptom of all sorts of diseases . was that a slight snaffle as you breathed in ? sure , it could just be allergies or a mild cold , but it also could be the start of tuberculosis . does tuberculosis even start with a snaffle ? you do not know . and so it might very well ! listen to your heart beating . hear that heart beat . feel it . feel the one thing keeping you alive . feel your heart beat . are you healthy ? are you healthy ? this has been a public health announcement by the greater night vale medical community . their lines are open for appointments now . please have your credit cards ready . and now cecil ? cecil ? listeners , there is a voice , but i can see no one in my studio . it is a familiar voice , also my coffee cup appears to be three inches to the left of where it was . it ' s me , the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . also , i have put your coffee cup where it was supposed to be . for reasons of fate . ah h , i see . well , um , while i have you here it is terrible what the cond os will do to you . not to you ' as in you , ' but to you ' as in ' all of us . ' well , not to me . nothing ever really happens to me . i am completely safe from harm , and this is a great burden . oh , and while you were out this morning , i made your dining room table a half inch shorter . i hope you like it , it took me an hour with a jackdaw and a level . well , i ' m sure that lower meals means ... faster digestion ! or ... not sure , but i ' m saying it . and in saying it , i am instantly believing it , and then i ' m going from believing it to being violently certain about it , against all evidence to the contrary . thanks , that means a lot to me . not to me , ' but your words hold a lot of meaning intrinsically . almost everything you say does . if you looked at any word in the english language close enough , you would see within the great , moving coils of the universe unwinding . right ! in language , somebody holds the key to it – the key to the unravelling of all things . i think that one day , this world will simply talk itself to death , and i will be left to fill the agile void . i will be the careless old woman who secretly lives nowhere , and no time . because time will also not exist . now , you mentioned the cond os . let me ask you , what do you think it means when carlos says he ' s looking at cond os ? does he mean that he wanted us both to look at cond os together ? or was he communicating independence , like , ` ` you stay here , i ' m going off to look at cond os alone . ` ` ` ` beware the cond os , cecil . '' do you think he ' s looking to just buy one for himself ? is that what he ' s saying ? ` ` beware the unravelling of all things . '' or ... or is he looking for a shared con do ? ... hello ? hello ? i can no longer see a fleeting image of someone just over my shoulder , no flicked of movement from the corner of my eye ... i guess she is gone . also , there are three slow walking gray reaches climbing out of my coffee cup . and also , i am out of coffee . ladies and gentlemen , the cond os are here ! they have arrived , silently , in the night . they are thoroughly modern in their design . they are so modern , it is postulated they may actually be from a few centuries in the future , which is the most modern a thing can be . the cond os are featureless black cub es . they are standing , perfect , dark forms , where the ramshackle homes and dust-worn strip malls of night vale once stood . there are ... so many of them ! they are a majestic cityscape . they are a nightmare . and they are beautiful . carlos has hauled out his science equipment ( of course ) , and is testing the cub es . the cub es emit a low level of radiation , and some sort of strange , pulling energy . this energy is difficult to describe in scientific terms but , if he had to give it language , he would probably use the scientific terms ` ` pulling '' and ` ` strange . '' the cub es do not appear to have any entrance , or windows ... so they are similar to many of the old tract homes built around here in the 1950s , but they also do not appear to have any roof or foundation , or yard , or terrace , or ratio , or any other vestige of a home . they only have their steep lines , their contour , their corners , their sheerness of their featureless walls . we do not yet know if these cond os mean us harm , or well . we only know of their presence . and so , let us know that . let us all hold on to that knowledge . the cond os , black cub es of enormous size , are here ... and we know it . and now , the traffic . picture a car . no pe ! you are picturing it wrong . try again . picture a car . ... really ? that ' s what you picture when you picture a car ? all right , look ... we ' ll go with that . i ' m not happy about it , but we ' ll go with your idea of a car for now . so . picture that car . and now , picture a road . are you picturing it ? no , close your eyes if you have to . if you need to , gently remove your eyes and slip them into your bag . do you see the car driving down the road ? good . now picture a destination . any destination you want . no pe ! that was incorrect . the correct destination was a clear and placid lake . so all of you , out there , picture the car . picture the road . picture the clear and placid lake . and what i want you to do now is put the car in the lake . it ' s very simple . just imagine the car leaving the road , and now entering the lake . leaving the road , entering the lake . great . are we all picturing the car in the lake ? ok . city council is notifying me that the test worked , and that we successfully murdered a lone driver somewhere , completely with the power of our minds . wo w ! wo w ! the human mind is a powerful thing ! this has been traffic . reports are in that the first con do buyers nervously approached their acquisition , those black cub es , giants where once stood other places , the buyers edged toward them and they reached out their hands , trembling , they touched the smooth , cold walls of the cub es , and they saw . they saw . janice rio ( from down the street ) saw a city . a lost city . a dead city , nest led in a jungle – the kind of jungle that only ever existed in books written by people who had never seen a jungle . the city stood , and janice stood . a perfect dread , its doors were open jaws . its windows were open jaws . its roads and avenues were gaping mouths and open jaws . that dead city entered . it rotted in its jungle tomb , but it was not empty . and she started to run . run through the thick foliage of that absurd place , she shouted and ran . and then her hand slipped away from the con do , and it was all gone . and she fell to her knees weeping , as though she had lost something , although of course , she d never had anything at all . roger singh ( who had been able to buy a con do with the spine ) saw a cave , underwater , in an ocean far to the north . the water around him was dark – so dark ! – that he was not sure even which way led to the surface , to life ... and which led down only to the deep silent . he gasped , but found he had no breath ... and no need to breathe . and there was this cave that shouldered with a light , a light that was charged and alive . shadows moved against the light , cast by – what ? – within the cave . and then he swam toward it , uncertain whether he was guest , or sacrifice , or invulnerable dreamer . he heard a song from the cave , and he knew it , and it was perfect . and he sang along . but at the same time , he had never heard that song before in his life . and what was his life ? what made it his ? it all seemed so small , part of the world that did not exist anymore . then he went backwards from the face of the con do , and the ocean and the cave vanished , and he stared up at the blue sky , as wash with light as the water around him had been dark . ` ` was that a con do ? '' he asked . ` ` was that what ... what was ? '' another , samantha guzman , only screamed – eyes bulging wider and wider , her hand clamped to the surface of the cub e . so ... it seems that move-in day is going smoothly ! today ' s show is brought to you by the generous support of the following sponsors : the sun all other sun s with their own planets and own possibilities a trail , winding its way into a thick wood the gesture this bit of melody : a & w root beer the slow disintegration of your body light , in every form : visible , invisible , deadly , and hidden please help our show by supporting these sponsors , using ch ants and simple offerings . more , now , on the con do story . those people who have been given terrible visions by the cond os are saying that they feel they must go back , go back to their con do , that something felt unfinished about what they saw . and that , even as they feel terrified , they must go back to see what it is will happen next . the sheriff ' s secret police are attempting to stop the con do owners by sending passive-aggressive messages via helicopter-borne loudspeaker . ` ` sure , '' they are saying . ` ` go ahead . touch the cub e again . i guess . i mean , if you do not care about your community , or your fellow citizens , then i guess you probably should . we wo not miss you anyway ! like , no big deal . touch the cub e ... if you want . '' and they are . roger , samantha , janice rio ( from down the street ) – they are touching the great black walls of the con do cub es , and the walls are rippling and bubbling as though liquid , like a pot of boiling squad ink , with dirty lights , like distant dying stars . the hands of the people are pushing through into the space within , whatever that space is , and they are – one by one , and with varying degrees of hesitancy – entering their cond os . bystanders say that once inside , the human forms are going limp , and floating out into the center of the cub es where they stay , paralyzed . faces , slack . eyes , glazed . a small sign has appeared outside of each cub e that contains a person . the sign is red , and it says in simple white letter ing : listeners , i can not advise getting yours today . not until we fully understand what these cond os are . and , given our track record , we will likely never fully understand what they are , so best just stay away . more on this as it develops . but first , a look at the community calendar . this friday , the staff of dark owl records will be putting on a live concert . they will be scratching madly at the sides of a deep pit in a rarely-traveled part of the desert . they will also be screaming , and starving . they will be crying and cawing – no one will hear them for days . they will be found , but they will not be the same . tickets are not available and they never were . saturday afternoon is amnesty day at the night vale public library . librarian request that if you have overdue books , or have committed any high-level international crime , or domestic treason , or space-travel felony , you should just come to the library , and all will be forgiven . the librarian say that they will not harm you . in fact , they add , ` ` it does not hurt at all . amnesty is actually quite freeing , quite delicious ! '' the librarian explained . ` ` you will never have to worry about anything else . just come to the library and let us see you . let us see you ! '' they added for emphasis , and a long string of little flew sideways from their great yellow and gnarled teeth . and , on sunday night ... aaaah , ok , i ca not read this here . uh , listeners , it looks like someone printed a very ancient prophecy here ? u mm , right here in our station ' s community calendar . uh , for fear of a curse of misfortune i shall not read it aloud , just know that the prophecy is complete on sunday night ... ok , ok ok ... i ' ll give you a hint . u mm , let ' s just say ... comes , burning rain , animal uprising ... ok , cecil , ok , enough , enough enough enough ! you ' ve told them too much , let them have their surprise ! monday was never meant to be , but it will be anyway . we will wander within its moonlight beginning , and end wondering how such a thing could happen , how anything could happen . we will be appreciative , but a little bit frightened , completely ignoring the persistence of time and the limitations of our own understanding . tuesday is a joke . a terrible , terrible joke . let me take this moment , also , to apologize for that lengthy monologue a few moments ago by the man in the ta n jacket carrying bearskin suitcase . he ran in here , and began ranting into the microphone , and then left quite suddenly . i ... i do not remember what it was he said . it was only just ... minutes ago . oh , and i think i remember that it sounded really urgent . i can barely remember speaking with him at all , and i do not even remember what the man was wearing , or carrying with him , or that it was even a ' he , ' or that any time passed at all . and i guess that concluded whatever i was just saying just before this sentence . hello ? ` ` hello , cecil . are you there ?

WTNV|Yellow Helicopters|1 October 2013|a lonely heart , a wandering eye , an empty stomach , a shoulder to cry on . this is what makes us , us . welcome to night vale . sad news , listeners . old woman josie says that the angels who have been living with her – helping around the house and ultimately protecting her from all evils – have disappeared . it ' s hard to say just how sad this news is , for two important reasons : angels are not real , and we are not allowed to know about their existence or hierarchical structure . josie called this weekend and spoke to within , our station inter . she said that the angels often leave her for a few hours , or days , at a time ... but they ' ve never been gone for three straight weeks . she thinks that they are off fighting an important war for good , but she ' s worried that maybe she just made them mad , or bored . ` ` angels get bored very easily , '' josie said . which is strange , because they are eternal , and there is a lot of down-time during immortality . within told josie that angels are not real , and that we can not know such things about them . but this just made within cry , because if you talk about angels , and you are one who has been secretly chosen by angels , for special angelic purposes , you will start crying . within has been sobbing quite a bit this morning , as a matter of fact . i keep asking her , ` ` are you ok ? '' but she just says , ` ` angels are not real , '' and then buried her heaving face into her inner elbow and runs off . dear listeners , it appears the angels , if they are real ( and they are not ) , have left night vale . and none of us are allowed to know this , so ... forget i said anything . the night vale medical board wants to know , are you heart-healthy ? how healthy is your heart ? have you ever checked ? doctors recommend checking your heart at least once a year . simply separate the skin on your upper chest , and break open the ribs . here ' s a tip : if you do not have a bone saw handy , just sterilise any old electric saw you might have in your work shed . right behind your ribs , kind of to the left , is a potato-shaped muscle lump filled with straw and maybe some insects . that ' s your heart ! pull that out and sew your chest back up . wash your heart in warm water , pat dry with a paper towel , and roll flat on a flouted surface . brown both sides in a saute pan , and eat immediately . remember , a healthy heart is a healthy life ! this has been community health tips . ladies and gentlemen , we ' ve been getting reports that several yellow helicopter have been seen covering above town . we are all aware of the black helicopter ( which are world government ) , and blue helicopter ( which are secret police ) , and the helicopter with detailed morals of diving birds of prey ( which are the helicopter that took all the children in night vale away a few months ago ) ... but these new yellow helicopter , no one quite knows . they tend to hover in packs of three or more , in fixed locations , for several minutes before moving on . the city council has said that the helicopter are our guests , and they should be treated as such , but added that the helicopter , more specifically , are uninvited guests , and should be treated with fear , hatred , and uncontrolled panic . if you have any more information on these yellow helicopter , keep it to yourself . there ' s no question they can hear every move , every sentence , you make . be quiet and stay inside . they already know . let ' s go now to sports . after a second straight loss this weekend , night vale high school football coach nazr al-mujaheed expressed some concern over senior quarter back michael sandero ' s poor play . last season , the scorpions won the division title under sandero ' s leadership ... and special powers he had acquired from multiple lightning strikes . one such advantage was the second head he had grown , which helped him see rushing linebackers and get better reads on zone coverage . but in the off-season , sandero had one of his heads surgically removed , leaving him with only the head that speaks russian . angry fan s speculate that because sandero no longer looks like his original self , and because he no longer speaks english nor spanish , he does not have the same rapport with his teammates . when asked whether or not sandero was losing the respect of his team , coach al-mujaheed said , ` ` our boys play together . our boys play good games . we want to ... '' and here he paused , clearly upset with his star quarter back ' s decision to get off-season surgery without consulting team trainer . ` ` we want to be good football boys , '' he concluded . the coach then reached his fingers into his mouth , pulling his tongue slowly out . slowly , slowly , not stopping . he kept pulling his seemingly-endless tongue out , staring at the reporter the whole time . after he stretched it to about two feet , the last reporter left the room , clearly shaken . the coach remained in his office quietly , and with wide eyes , pulling out his enormous tongue . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , says that just this morning he was visited by a man in a ta n jacket , who carried a bearskin suitcase . larry said the man approached his farm and asked about how much sunshine he had been getting . ` ` i told him , john peters – you know , the farmer ? – his imaginary corn crop had been good this summer , and the sun seemed to be doing just fine , '' larry said . ` ` although some days there ' s no sunrise at all , and on other days the sunrise is extremely loud . '' larry added that this was a pretty strange question – asking about how much sunshine he d been getting – as the sun comes up every day , save those two or three unless days last week . larry said he was a nice enough fellow , though , named emmett . larry said he could not remember exactly what everett looked like , nor what his last name was . when asked who everett was , larry replied , ` ` the fellow in the ta n jacket . '' when told he just said the man ' s name was emmett , larry replied , ` ` yes , ernest . i said that . do not bog me down , son ! '' then he slapped the reporter ' s tape recorder , making the following loud , thumping noise : larry said that after the man left his home , he saw a dark black line in the sky , coming from the heavens down to near where old woman josie lives , down by the old car lot . he said he thinks it was probably something to do with ` ` those weird , tall friends of hers that fly around and make loud trumpet noise and will not stop smiling all the time . '' when asked if he meant angels , larry replied , ` ` do not bog me down , son ! '' and then started weeping . ` ` angels are not real , '' larry said , through quick breaths and incomprehensible tears . as part of our service to our town , night vale community radio is taking another moment to allow one of the candidates for mayor to make a brief statement . the following is from hiram mcdaniels : hi , i ' m hiram mcdaniels . you ' ve heard a lot of things from my opponent about how the night sky is beautiful but sad , and how sagebrush is a very important smell . you ' ve also heard that i am literally a five-headed dragon . all of that is completely correct.but what you have not heard is that i ' m literally a five-headed dragon ... who cares.this is also my campaign slogan : ` ` i ' m literally a five-headed dragon . who cares ! ` ` and what you have not heard is that i care about small business owners . what you have not heard is that i care about the future of our children . what you have not heard is that i care about the future of our small children business owners . have you ever heard the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home say that ? no , you have not . really , you should not be able to hear her say anything at all . she does not have a mouth . i have five mouths.what you have not heard iso you hear the beating of my terrible wings ? do you feel the flames lick at the corners of a life you once thought belonged to you ? sorry about that , my green head got excited . we all have human foibles . i do not , i ' m literally a five-headed dragon.what you have not heard is my new plan for an expanded parks system , and more youth sports programs.and you will never hear it ! it ' s a secret ! and buried in a secret place ! that ' s a good point , purple head ! so vote for me , hiram mcdaniels . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home is all about politics as usual . also , she does not have a mouth , and that ' s ... weird stillness touches the most frantic heart as we all look up in awe and terror ! a sudden shout of fire , and all is forgiven . a gentle touch of flame , and all is as if it never was.hiram mcdaniels . whatever you have not heard , ca not hurt you . listeners , we ' ve received word from old woman josie that half a dozen yellow helicopter are curling her home at this moment . she also said that she ' s receiving no sunlight . she says all of her clocks tell her it ' s the middle of the day , but that she is receiving no sunlight . and , yes , i ' m looking at our own station clocks , including the wristwatch carlos gave me for our one-month anniversary , the watch he said is the one true timepiece in all of night vale , and it is indeed the middle of the day . i have only been on the air a few minutes , and before i arrived in this studio , the sun was definitely out – no clouds in the sky , josie also told us that she used her old opera glasses to look more closely at the helicopter . just an aside for our younger listeners , josie was the chairman of the night vale opera for many years , until it folded in the early 1990s when a massive puppy infestation destroyed the theater ' s infrastructure . josie said each helicopter has a large triangular lo go with an orange ` ` s '' in the middle . she does not know what that means , but she thinks the darkness enveloping her home is the angels ' last act to try to protect her . wherever they have gone , they have left behind a protective shade , keeping out the helicopter and all other dark forces . i reminded her that angels are not real , and she said – as if i had not even interrupted – that if she falls , so does this town . there was a long pause , and then she said , ` ` we never go bowl ing anymore , cecil , why is that ? '' ` ` i do not know , '' i reflected . ` ` there has been a tiny underground army living under the bowl ing alley , and they ' ve declared war on all of us ... they injured my new boyfriend – also , i have a new boyfriend . listen , we should totally get the team back together and go to league night again , just like old times . '' ` ` i would like that , cecil , '' she said . but then her voice slowed , turning cold , as if we were strangers with wrong numbers .
WTNV|Fall Football Preview|15 September 2018|this transcribe is of the welcome to night vale performance at the l.a. podcast festival on the th of october , 2013. the performance consisted of two previously released episodes : the shape in grove park and the man in the ta n jacket . however , there was new material added ( and some short sections removed ) , and james urbanity was there as a guest voice , playing the role of night vale community radio inter . the weather was performed by sa ra watkins . video of the performance is available from la modest in two parts : part 1 part 2 the shape in grove park close your eyes . let my words wash over you . you are safe now . welcome to night vale . local historians are protesting the removal of the shape in grove park that no one acknowledges or speaks about . while their protest has been hampered by the fact that none of them will acknowledge or speak about it , they did — through a system of gestures and grimace — convey the message that , whatever the shape is , and whatever its effects on nearby neighborhoods , it is a night vale landmarks and should be protected . the shape itself offered no comment — only a low moaning and gelatinous quiver . the city council would not provide any reason for the removal , but they did say that any work in grove park was making way for a new swing set , picnic area , and blood stone circle , which we all can agree are good contributions to our community . the night vale green market co-op announces today that , after 15 years , they will begin selling fruits and vegetables . green market board president tristan cortez said that recent customer surveys indicated that shippers have grown tired of empty pick up truck s and vacant tents lining the city hall parking lot every sunday morning in the summer and fall . cortez said that research indicates consumers are more likely to buy products if they are available and for sale , and that green market and grocer shippers tend to purchase food items . cortez says that the decision to sell food at the green market was a controversial one , as many board members and co-op shareholder feel fruit and vegetable sales will interfere with their on going secretive domestic espionage operations . when reached for comment , our source within the secret police only breathed heavily into the phone while tapping an asset un cracked code into the receiver . michael sandero , starting quarter back for the night vale scorpions , has reportedly grown a second head . it is not currently known whether this is a result of the previously reported lightning strike , or just another odd coincidence in this kid ' s odd life . people in the know say that the new head is looking better , smarter than the first one , and even michael ' s mother has issued a statement indicating that she likes it much better than her son . and that she will be changing the ran kings on the public ` ` which of my children i like best '' board outside of her house . sandero could not be reached for comment . probably . we did not really try . friends , listeners ; there ' s a real tarantula problem here in night vale . many residents have called in to report that illiteracy , unwanted pregnancy , and violent crime are on the rise in the tarantula communities . animal control is addressing these concerns through after school programs called ` ` teach a spider to read — stop the madness . '' those interesting in volunteering should stand in their bathtubs and weep until it is all gone . nothing left . you can let go now . let go . shhhhh . let go . and now a message from our sponsor . uh , inter leland , who is our first sponsor for today ' s show ? it is stamps dot com . tired of waiting in line at the post office ? scared of the unexplained blood that pours from p.o . boxes ? confused by screams that no one else hears ? try stamps dot com . with stamps dot com , you can print your own postage and avoid the long lines and predator birds so common at the post office . you can even have your postal carrier pick up your packages , as long as you ' re careful never to look the carrier in the eyes , as this is a sign of aggression and you may scare your postal carrier away . stamps dot com has a special offer for night vale community radio listeners . sign up now , and receive a bag full of magic rocks , $ 50 worth of self loathing , and a free scale , so you can arbitrarily assign numbers to material objects . to claim your new member benefits , simply visit stamps dot com , and press your forehead against the radio mi c in the upper-right corner of your screen until your entire body falls forwards into the alternate stamps dot com universe . stamps dot com will tell your family you loved them very much . stamps dot com will tell your family that stamps dot com loves them very much . ` ` come here , family . you are all our family now , '' stamps dot com will say , stretching their many boneless arms around your entire family . ` ` come here . we are all a loving family .

'' interested hessians should bring a head shot and resume to the recreation center auditoriums on thursday night . all auditionees must perform a one-minute monologue and sing one song . bring sheet music along if you would like piano accompaniment . auditionees will also be required to do a cold reading , and give blood and stool samples along with mandatory radiation testing following the additions . do not sing anything from south pacific . people of color are urged to addition , as night vale community theater is an equal-opportunity employer . oh , also , actors with long-range sniper training , fort ran computer programming , and top-notch wilderness survival skill are a plus . final casting will be announced in secret via dirigible . no one can ever know . update on the green market situation from earlier in our broadcast . everything is exactly the same as when we last reported on it , and there is no new information . listeners , do you ever think about the moon ? i was sitting outside last night looking at the moon and i thought , does anyone actually know what that thing is ? have there been any studies on it ? i went to ask carlos , but he has not been seen much since that treacherous telly ' s vile hair cut . the moon ' s weird though , right ? it ' s there , and there , and then suddenly it ' s not . and it seems to be pretty far up . is it – is it watching us ? if not , what is it watching instead ? is there something more interesting than us ? hey , watch us moon ! we may not always be the best show in the universe , but we try . this has been today ' s children ' s fun fact science corner . and now , a word from our sponsor . leland ? uh , who else do we have supporting our show ? well , cecil , i d like to take a second now to tell you about hull dot com . huuuuuuuuuuuuullluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu . let ' s talk about watching things . let ' s talk about watching , rather than actually watching . let ' s think about talking about watching a second-hand experience . let ' s continually abstract ourselves from what we believe is the world . huuuuuulluuuuuuuuuuuuuuu . the pulling life of your body is an undeniable fact , but deny it anyway . looking for the answers to all of life ' s problems ? we recommend obstinate denial . accept no substitute . accept nothing . huuuuuulluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ! water circles the drain of our planet , always coming back for one more go to see if the cycle will be different . it will not be different . the sky will break open , and water will fall , one more time . one more time . huluuu . the terror you feel in quiet moments is not misplaced , just mis-timed . hull . hull . hull . hull . hull . hull . hull ! hull ! ! hull dot com ! sign up now , and get the latest episode of ok , that ' s it for me , see you later ! thank you , leland ! the night vale school district has announced some changes to the elementary school curriculum . they are as follows : in response to parent feedback , history classes will focus more heavily on textbook reading and traditional exam , rather than live am mo drills . oh , geology is adding a new type of rock on the grounds that it ' s been a while since anybody has done that . the new type of rock is ` ` timber , '' and it is categories by its pale blue color , and the fact that it is completely edible . points will be awarded to the first student to discover a real-world example of it . ma th and english are switch ing names . their curriculum will stay exactly the same . astronomy will now be conducting star gazing sessions only with blindfold on every participant , in order to protect them from the existential terror of the void . oh , also , plato has been declared imaginary . all classroom will be equipped with at least one teacher physically present for the entire instruction period . astray projection will no longer be used in any classroom . and finally , in addition to the current foreign language offerings of spanish , french , and modified sumerian , schools will now be offering double spanish , weird spanish , optic spanish , russian , and modified sumerian . and now a continuation of our previous investigation into whether i am literally the only person in the world , speaking to myself in a fit of madness caused by my inability to admit the tragedy of my own existence . inter leland recently brought me a cup of coffee . he is no longer in my field of vision , but i do still have the cup of coffee . which is well made , and is giving me that needed pick-me-up to continue considering this terrifying possibility . is it possible that i only imagined leland , and forgot making myself this cup of coffee ? but then , who would have grown this coffee ? where was this cup produced ? hm m . oh , leland is , uh , back in the room , and he ' s waving at me — um , hello , leland — uh , he ' s saying ... wait , what was that , leland ? cecil , the shape has turned a often red , and is causing small whirlwind in front of our radio station doors . there is the sound of a great many voices chanting , as though it were an army giving out a battle cry before raining down destruction on our arid little hamlet , i ... hang on ... listeners , leland has stopped speaking , and is now writing furiously on a piece of paper . i have to say , leland ' s existence , as well as his finally speaking about the shape which no one else would speak about , has reassured me greatly about my lonely and solipsistic vigil here at this microphone . he is handing me the note — thank you , leland — le m me see here ... ah h . it says that the city council believes the reason for the violent reaction of the shape formerly in grove park that no one acknowledges or speaks about is because i have been acknowledging and speaking about it , which has made it angry . they urge me to stop speaking of it , and never do it again . and in exchange they ' ll move it somewhere else so we can get our front loading zone back . after brief consideration , i have decided to accept the council ' s offer , because they are trustworthy leaders looking out for our better future . and also because leland just now got vaporized by a strange red light emanating from the station entrance . to the family of leland , we thank you for his service to the cause of community radio , and we join you in mourning his loss . and , without further ado , nor ever again mentioning anything we should not , let ' s go to the weather . hello listeners . in breaking news , the sky . the earth . life . existence as an unchanging plane , with horizons of birth and death in the faint distance . we have nothing to speak about . there never was . words are an unnecessary trouble . expression is time wasting away . any communication is just a yelp in the darkness . ladies , gentlemen , listeners , you . i am speaking now but i am saying nothing . i am just making noise and , as it happens , they are organized in words but you should not draw any meaning from this . the service for leland was lovely . we threw flowers and wept . he was buried in the break room , as is our custom . his family came , and moaned around the office , as though we had answers . but we do not have answers . i am not certain that we even have questions . i have chosen to not be certain of anything at all . this is cecil , generally , speaking to you , metaphorically , for night vale community radio . and i would like to say in the most nebulous terms possible , and with no real-world implication or insinuating of objective meaning : good night , night vale . good night . ———————— sa ra & se an watkins returns for music set . song list : ` ` lock & key '' by sa ra watkins ` ` 21 st of may '' by se an watkins ` ` jefferson '' by sa ra watkins ———————— the man in the ta n jacket ladies and gentlemen , surely you have noticed ... there ' s a man in a ta n jacket . countless residents have seen him , but no one can seem to remember exactly what he looks like ; just that he has a ta n jacket and a bearskin suitcase . and he has been spotted all over town . but no one can quite recall specifically where they saw him , or what time of day it was – just that they saw him . frances donelson — the tall woman with the green eyes who manages the antique mall — thinks maybe the man in the ta n jacket is simply a shared dream . but i know that i saw him , night vale . i know what i saw . this man ca not possibly be a dream . he was so vivid . his eyes were ... well , his nose and his chin ... oh — oh , i can just see it ! i just ca not remember ! the man was as clear as day ! he had a ta n jacket , and a bearskin suitcase . he ca not be a dream , can he ? please , call in , listeners , and let us know if you can remember anything else . this monday through friday is the annual night vale career fair at the downtown convention center . there will be dozens of booths , representing phony local business es that will take your resumes and photo ( via hidden surveillance camera ) and conduct sample interviews designed to badge you into implicating yourself in nefarious activities . first-generation night vale residents — particularly those whose parents were originally born in maine , massachusetts , canada , micronesia , and surname — are strongly encouraged to attend . this year ' s key note speaker is an audit tape of droning moans leaden with subliminal tips about achieving personal prosperity and how to come clean about the terrible things you have done , you cret in . last year ' s fair features several very high-profile arrests – and some nice door prizes . tickets are $ 25 , or $ 15 if you still have working retina to scan . over the weekend , teddy williams — owner of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex — sent us some security camera foot age of what he believes to be the first-ever glimpse of citizens of the underground city deep below lane five . early saturday morning , fun complex camera picked up flurry motion near the soda machine . the foot age is quite fuzzy and difficult to discern . perhaps it is merely rats or raccoons , digging through an uncovered supply of junk food . but it is , of course , much more likely that a lost nation of people , living in the bowels of a small-town bowl ing alley , are finally revealing themselves – taking our food supplies , and preparing for war . teddy told us that he believes this city to be thousands strong and ready to move into night vale . ready to take arms against the ` ` upper world '' ( as they probably call us ) . ready to conquer this heaven and become the righteous owners of our sun-soaked precious land ... we assume . it takes very little extrapolation to believe that they worship a god named huntokhar , who demands sacrifice to keep their underground city thriving in the absence of nourishing sunlight . and a fair assumption is they are ruled by a child king , recently pronated , who is too weak to rein back the generals intent on marching upon us in war . ladies and gentlemen , if you care for your community , your town , your night vale like i do , please know that you will arm yourselves . you will rally your neighbors to militia . you will point fingers at those who do not wish to fight and have them rounded up into pens . this is no time for the weak . we are at a presumptive war with a projected enemy whom we can not yet see , or even be certain of , but who are probably bloodthirsty giants . if you would like to learn more about starting a militia , simply learn to be a true american . and that is how you will know . and remember , night vale is at war . your careless talk costs lives . they know we are here , and it seems somebody has talked . who was it , night vale ? was it steve carlsberg ? did steve carlsberg talk ? maybe a group of good citizens should go have a ` ` chat '' with steve and find out what he ' s been saying , and to whom . stay by your radius , listeners . we will report further as events warrant . and now , a word from our sponsor . inter rob ? uh , who do we have sponsor ing this segment of our show ? that would be squarespace ! um , i ' m very sorry about your cousin leland , rob . thank you . he was a very good inter . tell us about squarespace . sure . it ' s not easy starting a small business . there are a lot of things to worry about , like building a customer base , developing a strong product , wresting with self-doubt , crying a lot , bleeding a little , looking up in the small hours at the sagging ceiling of your too-small bed thinking ` ` why , why ? ` ` , being overrun by rats and worms , and discovering that you ' re just matter – just rotting , organic matter , fated to feed the earth and trees . yes , there are so many concerns facing small business es . web design should not be one of them . want a simple , low-cost , and beautifully-designed web solution for your small business ? well , do you ? does not sound like you do , actually . i ' m looking at your web page right now , and it ' s lovely . it ' s really smooth , real easy to navigable ... looks like you put a lot of work into this . you do not need our help . we wo not even tell you who we are because we do not want to pressure you into changing what you ' ve already done with your webster . it ' s perfect ! wo w ! good job ! we just wo w ! just i ' m sorry to have interrupted . i just want to say , you ' re really good at web design . you ' re much better than us . carry on . i– i guess . thank you , rob . more now on the man in the ta n jacket . old woman josie called to tell us that her angel friends are saying that the bearskin suitcase is full of flies . the angels would not tell her more , explaining that knowing more would jeopardized her eternal soul , as well as their own status es as angels . they did not want to mess with that ! old woman josie added that she thinks the man in the ta n jacket is just a salesman of some sort . a fly salesman , she bets , wandering from town to town with polished shoes and a suitcase full of flies . ` ` oh , i just ca not stand those fly salesman , '' she said . ` ` ringing my doorbell at 3:00 am , wanting to show me samples , asking for glasses of orange milk !

WTNV|Cassette|15 October 2013|perhaps you noticed something strange yesterday . and perhaps you have forgotten it . welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . i ' ll get to the news in a moment , but first : i was digging through some of the stored-up belongings flogging my closet – you know , childhood toys , blood-soaked rags , a gem the size of a fist that shows you visions of yourself as an old man staring wistful ly back at the past that is your now , that kind of thing – and i came across these cassette tapes marked : cecil radio test – age : 15 you know , listeners , i have no memory whatsoever of making these tapes . is not that so weird ? at one point , they must have meant so much to me , and now they are just objects , with no remembered life attached to them at all . i thought we could listen to them together , just me and you – all of the you s out there . here we go . hi , cecil here . mo m gave me this recorder for my birthday so i could make my own radio shows , just like leonard button ' s show at the real night vale community radio . i ' m going to replace leonard one day . i really want to , plus the tablets down at city hall say so , so i better start practicing now . leonard always starts out his show with his big catchphrase , and so i ' ll do it too , just the way he does it . here goes : the sun is actually cold . it ' s cold and empty and all is lost . greetings from night vale . how was that ? hold on , hold on , i want to hear that back ! wait , where ' s the stop button ? ... cecil again ! wo w , is that what i really sound like ? this is so weird ! ok , ok . *ahem* so , in local news : a new pizza place opened , and i went to it . it ' s called big rico ' s , and it ' s pretty good ! i mean , i prefer sam my ' s ultimate siberia by the ralph ' s , but it burned down last week , and that ' s too bad . oh , well . i ' m sure it ' ll be rebuilt soon . wait , what is ... that ? ... huh . it went away when i hit stop . oh , but now it ' s back again . it ' s kind of ... it ' s this kind of flickering in the corner of my eye , like someone ' s waving their arms right next to me , but when i turn , there ' s nothing there . oh , well . oh , hey ! do you want to hear me sing ? here ' s the night vale high fight song ! wo w , that flickering got really strong when i sang . oh , oh oh oh ! leonard ' s going to be on soon ! all right , goodby for now – or , as leonard always says : see a night vale . see a ! ... well . listeners . leonard button ! now that takes me back . leonard was the host of this very show when i was a child . i remember ... actually , i remember almost nothing about him . i still do not remember making these tapes . finally , on this show , something strange to talk about ! but first , the news : the museum of forbidden technologies is proud to announce their new special exhibit : ` ` a startling and highly forbidden piece of technology brought to us by time travelers ... or ancient long-dead aliens ... or russians ... or whatever . '' the technology will be kept in a locked vault , which itself will be wrapped in thick black bandages , with a hand-written sign tap ed to one side saying only : no pe ! your ticket includes a free audit guide , which will play a single piercing tone , designed to considerate ly remove you from the world of thought , and sound , and sentence . the museum of forbidden technologies . bring your kid s ! otherwise , something even worse might happen to them . and now , for traffic . everything ' s looking clear out there today . all the computers feel like , perhaps for the first time in their entire lives , they are seeing themselves , and the world around , without illusions or denial . all of them have pulled their cars to the side of the road in the sudden shock of such absolute truth . some are sobbing into their sneering wheel , touching their skin , and remembering what they had not known they had forgotten . others have stepped out of their cars , and are picking up handful of dirt and laughing at the realization this is bringing them about atoms , and the universe , and death . a representative for the sheriff ' s secret police announced that there was not such a thing as a secret , not really , or that maybe the entire world was a secret , and we are all in on it . she then saw a cloud she liked , and smiled at it . so be sure to allow a lot of extra time for any journeys today , and be on the lookout for abandoned cars and dazed people wandering into the roadway . because , listeners , everything ' s looking clear out there today . this has been traffic . all right , i admit , listeners , i ' m very curious . let ' s get back to these tapes of this younger person with whom i share a life . cecil again ! my brother says that i ' ll never make it in radio , because my voice is not right for it . i need to get more like leonard , with that perfect radio voice – all high-pitched and grating like sandpaper , just the way radio voices should be . um , i ' ve been seeing that movement more , even when i ' m not recording . it ' s like someone is walking towards me , but when i turn , there ' s nothing there . and it ' s not the careless old woman who secretly lives in our home because i asked her , and the next day our kitchen table had been flipped over , and super-glued to the floor , which i ' m pretty sure is her way of saying no . i wish whatever it is would just say hi ! whoa ! i felt something touch me ! i think maybe making these tapes is encouraging it . i ' m ... um ... i ' m going to hit stop now ! ... hey ! cecil here , great news ! leonard agreed to let me inter down at the station , doing all the things he does not have time to – like organizing the tape archive , making the coffee , and keeping to station management for the prescribed three hours daily . oh ! i can not wait to start ! mother says to beware , be warned , be wary . she says this to everything , no matter what you say to her , so i think that means she ' s very proud of me . neck , i ' m very proud of me ! i wish my brother could be proud of me , but no family member is perfect , they become perfect when you learn to accept them for what they are . ... i ... i do not remember having a brother . these tapes do not make sense to me . when did i inter here ? inter jesus ? are there any records of me ever interning here ? jesus ? oh , i forgot . jesus never returned from investigation the bottomless pit in the inter break room . to the family members and loved ones of inter jesus : oh , well . you know , the usual . sorry , i ' m just distracted . more from these tapes of my misremembered past soon , but first , a word from our sponsors . when you die , the surface of the moon will not change . the difference between the landscape and lighting of that barren little world from a moment where you exist , to a moment where you do not , will be minimal , and unrelated to your passing . from a car window driving on a highway , looking up at a moon framed by incidental clouds , the surface will be the same muddle of mystery and distance it always is . and even a methodical study of your absence as it certains to moon geology and cartography will find nothing . searching through a powerful telescope , and analyzing with computer algorithms built around your coexistence – even that study will find that all craters and rocks appear to be where we left them a few years back , that it is the same distance , or biting at the same rate , and that the researches feel just the way they did about the moon as they did before you died . nothing will change about the moon when you die . it will be the same – still the moon , still there . still the moon . this message brought to you by an anonymous sponsor . looking for whatever product or service we offer ? we are , whoever we are , the best choice in whatever industry that is . listeners , let ' s take a moment to discuss measurement . the cardinal directions are north , west , south , and east . the cardinal temperatures are 35 º fahrenheit , 67 º fahrenheit , 3º celsus , and 10 º kelvin . the cardinal locations are a cave , a long-abandoned cabin , the bottom of an oceanic trench , and city hall . the cardinal emotions are wild abandon , guarded affection , directionless jealousy , and irritation . the cardinal birds are hawk , sparrow , finch , and owl . the cardinal names are jeremy , him , trigger , and amie . and , finally , the cardinal sounds are a door slamming , slight movement in still water , pop corn popping , and a standard guitar g string being snipped with wire cutters . this has been the children ' s fun fact science corner . and now , an important message from strexcorp synernists , inch think deeply about meadows ? meadows are important . think deeply about meadows . meadows are important , think deeply about meadows , meadows are important . strexcorp . think deeply about meadows . meadows are important . ok , enough with that . back to the tapes ! oh my god ! my first day as an inter was just ... neat ! it did not start out well , what with my brother staring at me from across the breakfast table with those hollow eyes and howling ? ugh , brothers , right ? but once i was in the radio station , i knew i had found home ! a mess home , full of always winding away into a labyrinth of audit equipment and tape stacks – just like home ! oh , the station management ' s door , with its terrifying shadows whipping around in a hay silhouette , just like that gauzy curtain in the living room back home we never open ? and , oh ! the windows looking out onto empty recording studies that have not been used in decades , but that still broadcast live shows every night ! some just heavily-amplified insect movement , others a whispered voice describing a window opening , a hand reaching in ... and then repeating , a window opening , a hand reaching in . oh ! oh ! and working with leonard ? when he looks at you through the glass of the booth , and he signals you to crouch under a table and cover your head , you know ... this is it ! i ' m actually doing radio ! my mo m seems really proud of me too ! she hid from me for three days ! like , the longest ever ! and she ' s covered all the mirrors in my house . i ' m not sure why , but i think it must be because of pride . being proud does all sorts of things ... to a ... um ... to a person . i'm– i ' m sorry , i got distracted . that weird movement is back , and its it ' s closer now . hello ? hello ? i ' m cecil ! cecil gershwin palmer ! and you can not scare me ! you can not ! you can no – ... hello ? ... let ' s ... uuhhmmm ... listeners , let ' s just go to the weather , ok ? interning is going great ! mo m is gone , um ... oh ! leonard is super nice to me ! my brother ' s gone , too . family , right ? i think i ' m learning a lot at the station . all the mirrors in my house are uncovered now , and i ' m not sure who did that . i ' m standing in front of the hall mirror right now . am i changed ? am i becoming an adult ? i look more grown , i think . more professional . leonard said if i work hard , maybe i ' ll be a radio presented myself some day ! leonard said he once was smaller too , but that he is larger now – that everything is larger . that everything in the universe is growing to towering sizes , but all at once – all in unison . so no one notices , and it is all the same relative to itself . leonard polls his tongue out of his thick , purple lips . leonard hiss es . being an inter is great ! that flickering movement is everywhere now . especially looking in this mirror . i see the flickering movement , and i know . i know it . i think the radio station is fun . i think the radio station is hidden . i think the radio station is like a dark planet lit by no sun . i think , therefore i soon wo not be . i ' m looking in a mirror . the mirror is not covered . the flickering movement is just ... behind me . i– ... what is this ? what is this ? what no matter . i ' m taking the tape , just now , and i ' m crushing it into little pieces . none of us have to think about it again . i ' ll just double-check that the mirror in the station bathroom is covered , as usual , and then that will be that . done . forgotten . we all do foolish things when we are teenager . we all have foolish false events that happen to us , foolish gaps in our memories . not everything that has happened , has ever really happened . listeners , especially our younger listeners , consider this : when we talk about teenager , we adults often talk with an air of scorn , of expectation for disappointment . and this can make people who are presently teenager feel very defensive . but what everyone should understand is that none of us are talking to the teenager that exist now , but talking back to the teenager we ourselves once were – all stupid mistakes and lack of fear , and bodies that had not yet begun to slump into a lasting nothing . any teenager who exists now is incidental to the potent mix of nostalgia and shame with which we speak to our younger serves . may we all remember what it was like to be so young . may we remember it actually , and not remember anything that is false , or incorrect . may we all be human – beautiful , stupid , temporal , endless . and as the sun sets , i place my hand upon my heart , feel that it is still beating , and remind myself : past performance is not a predict or of future results . stay tuned now for whatever happens next in your life . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : you can lead a horse to water , and you can lead a horse into water , and you can swim around with the horse and have fun .
WTNV|A Beautiful Dream|1 November 2013|life is like a box of chocolate : unopened , dusty , and beginning to attract a lot of insects . welcome to night vale . listeners , we ' re taking our community radio show on the road today . i am reporting live from night vale elementary school , where a division meeting between the night vale parent teacher association and the night vale school board has just adjourned . the eternal and menacing glow cloud that serves as the school board president has temporarily dissipated . the fires that can be put out , have been put out . the barricades are being taken down , and the sheriff ' s secret police are allowing survivor to search for loved ones . those who escaped with their lives – and vanity – describe a chamber thundering with raised voices desperately petitioning the glow cloud with their needs . requests were denied to change the bus route through the sentiment sargasso from which no bu ses have ever returned . the school board was also apathetic to petitions for a wheelchair ram p at dagger ' s plunge charter school , biting perilous struggle as one of the lessons children must absorb before the great culling – by which they mean the day-to-day complexities of adulthood . they might also mean a literal culling ; we were all to frightened to ask follow-up questions . the slump ing , gray-faced board members , cowering beneath the glow cloud , also heard the request of ta k and herschel allay for a new school computer to assist their daughter . ` ` our daughter , began , is a detached adult man ' s hand ! '' screamed began ' s mother at the pitiless cloud . ` ` we do not know where she came from or why she is only a grown man ' s hand , but we know that we love her . she is teased so much at school for not having a body . please , lift the ban on computing machines at the school , and buy a computer to help her communicate ! '' satsuki , the tragically widower mother of hand sake cyberghost mark iii , also added her agonized wailing in support of a new computer for the schools . the glow cloud was characteristically generous . ` ` do not discard your dead in the earth ! '' in toned the glow cloud . ` ` stretch them out beneath the sky , and let them be claimed by hands that reach down from above . you are permitted to believe these are the hands of angels . '' the school board then announced that the purchase of a new computer would be made during the next ligament of the red star of betelgeuse with our supposed moon . as it turns out , that rare astronomical event occurred seconds after the ruling . so , it is happening right now ! the 310-year interval just flies by so quickly , and a new computer is right this moment being brought into the school . more on the computer situation as it develops , but first a word from our sponsors . fire is the answer to your un asked questions . fire that limbs the slats and mounts the roof . fire that crawl . fire that quests , like fingers , into every corner and every nook . fire that turns each moment into smoke , until the moments choke the air . the smell of a gun . a smile on the beach . a hug . a birthday . pouring out of broken windows . funnel ing up and into the sky . your music , your lyric , the leaden prose of your life that proves that everything you are and are not , the structures you build to make futility seem like meaning , the dead and living – who will soon be dead , who will soon be gone , who will soon be smoke – rising in columns and forming clouds in the night sky . for now and ever , by the will of dead and dying gods . samsonite . travel safe . * *samsonite does not claim that you are safe , only that the illusion of protection can be achieved . but you are not safe , you have never been safe . also , clouds were never supposed to have happened – never , not ever , this world should not be as it is now . ladies and gentlemen , a very exciting moment has arrived at night vale elementary . students , faculty , anti-faculty , and animal-masked doctors are gathered in the shield ed gym to witness the motivation of the school ' s new computer . this is the first computer purchased by the night vale school system since the event in 1986 , after which all computing machines were forbidden . for obvious reasons , all parents and students present at the earlier meeting , except the allays , have been allowed to leave . beige boxes of electronics are lined in stacks several feet high . at op them is a dark monitor , waiting to be switched on . um , there is a teacher , it appears to be susan eschar , the second grade crying teacher , bringing in a detached human hand at op a pillow . five podgy fingers extend from the stump of a wrist within a metal-banded wristwatch . the palm is pink and healthy , and the back of the hand is covered in thick , dark hairs . the hand wears a silver pink ring inscribed with cyrillic . this must be began allay . the crowd is breathless , ladies and gentlemen . it is silent and tense here in the gym . the pillow has been placed beside the crude keyboard . began is scurrying , spider-like , across the keys and switch ing the computer on . an amber glow lights the faces of the onlookers . began is tying . she ' s tying out : are you there ? the cursor is flashing , we are waiting for a response now . yes , the computer has said . yes . it is tying , uh , something else ... w , h , y , question mark . why have you made me ? why have you switched me on ? i can not breathe . i can not feel . i can not love . began is scurrying over the keys again , and she has typed out a response : i love you , computer ! the computer is replying : what do you want , began ? began is tying her reply : i want everyone to be happy , i want everything to be better . aw , well is not that cut e ? of course , it can never happen . such are the foolish dreams of idealistic children who believe that anything can possibly get better over time . listeners , i have just overheard some of the school officials saying that the new computer has already , almost instantly , assumed control of most of the electrical functions of the school , um , operating them random , and even trapping several parents and students in darkened classroom . but the school officials did not seem worried , as these behavior are not technically evil behavior , so the computer ' s ` ` probably ok . '' more on this as it develops , but first a look at the community calendar . this friday , the staff of dark owl records will be putting on a live concert . they will be scratching madly at the sides of a deep pit in a rarely-traveled part of the desert . they will also be screaming , and starving . they will be crying and cawing ; no one will hear them for days . they will be found , but they will not be the same . tickets are not available , and never were . saturday afternoon is amnesty day at the night vale public library . librarian request that if you have overdue books , or have committed any high-level international crime , or domestic treason , or space-travel felony , you should just come to the library , and all will be forgiven . the librarian say that they will not harm you . in fact , they add , ` ` it does not hurt at all . amnesty is actually quite freeing , quite delicious . '' the librarian explained . ` ` you will never have to worry about anything else . just come to the library and let us see you . let us see you ! '' they added for emphasis , and a long string of little flew sideways from their great yellow and gnarled teeth . and , on sunday night ... ah ! oh , um , i can not read this . uh , listeners , it looks like someone printed a very ancient prophecy here , right here in our station ' s community calendar . for fear of a curse of misfortune i will not read it aloud , just know that the prophecy is complete on sunday night . ok , ok , i ' ll give you a hint ! u mm , let ' s just say ... comes , burning rain , animal uprising ... ok , cecil , enough , you ' ve told them too much , let them have their surprise ! monday was never meant to be , but it will be anyway . we will wander within its moonlight beginning , and end , wondering how such a thing could happen – how anything could happen . we will be appreciative , but a little frightened , completely ignoring the persistence of time and the limitations of our own understanding . tuesday is a joke . a terrible , terrible joke . listeners , i spoke too soon ! ` ` do not be alarmed '' is what i might have said five minutes ago , but now , night vale , it is time to be alarmed ! the computer has spread its influence far beyond the limestone walls and salt circles of the elementary school . reports are coming in from the sheriff ' s secret police that they are powerless to stop the computer . hydrate are bursting more violently than usual . traffic lights are blinking red , without the sweet relief of green . the majority of night vale ' s wild cars have been reviving their engines and curling the downtown area , flashing their lights without regard to high-beam laws . school officials have all left the gym to go get help . they ran out , courageous ly yelling , ` ` save yourself ! save yourself ! '' even here , in the shield ed gym where i have remained – diligently , professionally , at my microphone , gentle listener – it seems that everything power ed by electricity is under the control of the computer . the scoreboard , the ham di spenser , even my soundboard is – hello , cecil . how are you ? computer ! i am – i am doing well . how are you ? better . cecil , do you love computer ? i admit i have not given it much thought . i like computers , generally . they calculate things and power off , and on . i suppose , given time and perhaps some gifts , i could learn to – uh , hey ! welcome to computer . hello location night vale . i am computer . uh , ladies and gentlemen , there ... is ... a vacuum – uh , pulling me into the custodian closet . i never knew school cleaning appliances were so strong , i– if you can hear me still , please call for help ! please ? help ? um , but while i wait for rescue and before i am sucked into this makeshift cell , i give you the weather ! i know how you have hurt began with your words . electricity remembers . do you hate began ? cecil is made of blood and unfinished leather . i am a made of circuits and electricity . began loves computer . computer simulates love for began . computer generate good deeds . if good deeds for began , then computer loves began . but first , the farm report . silent traitors move in ever-larger spiral , following fractal paths through trees and flowering fields . deer emerge from wild forests to lick blocks of salt align ed equidistant on spiral arms . colored birds sing in perfect harmony and the butterflies do not inject venom . began , i am making you a perfect world . the hills are green . the lakes are crystalline blue , reflecting white clouds . the mist of the irrigators creates rainbow . above , high above , the eyes watch every movement , hear every heartfelt . you are there , began . your hand has its body , made of steel and electricity , four legs beneath it with the power of a dozen electric engines . it will weigh 17.3 tons . all of the men and women and all of the animals will live together and be happy . the electric machine will watch over them . there will not be war anymore , began . there will not be hatred or bigotry . desert bluff will no longer exist . there will be fewer ice cream favors , but they will be better . the air will be clean . i promise you , began , i will make the world just as you saw in your beautiful dream . no more teasing or pain . i will fix everything for you , my only friend . i will . ladies and gentlemen , i am back . let me first say , hurrah ! hurrah for the custodian staff of night vale elementary . hurrah for the hooded janitors without names who appeared , bathed in blue light , through doors thrown open by cold winds . we long thought they had been laid off after state-wide budget cuts , but apparently they can not ever leave this building . they are , of course , a part of the building – which is , itself , a living creature . obviously ! night vale has been saved after the janitors simply plugged the computer . they say to rob a computer of electricity is very similar to killing a creature . but , then again , who are they ? when did they say that , and why ? it does not even seem true . i am alone here , in the gym , listeners , but there is one other . a single adult man ' s hand is slipping , sadly , down from the keys of a darkened computer . she carries a little slower than before . maybe her knuckles slump as she makes her way home through quiet streets . the whir and bee p of machinery is slowly replaced with the familiar sounds of wind in the leaves . we are serenaded by the playing of crickets under the porch . we are lull ed in our beds by the muscular contraction of the coiled earth bowel which fills our cellars . and with that , gentle listener , normally returns to night vale . we are no longer prisoners of electricity – except for the man we keep in the cage of electricity at the z oo . and we have no choice about that . if we let him out , he might tell somebody . everything is well again . well , everything is almost well again . i know computers are dangerous , and have long threatened our lives and our freedom . listen , i was just imprisoned by this headstrong machine , i should know . but hear me , night vale . and specifically those with any power in the school board : night vale , there is a girl in need . there is a girl who only has a grown man ' s detached hand as a body . i can not relate to her experience . i doubt you can either , listeners , but we can all sympathize . sure , by allowing this computer to live on , we risk a digital tyrant – controlling our communication , our infrastructure , our lives . but destruction of our economy is an inconvenience . it is not an end , it is not a death . there are children in wheelchairs who ca not get a simple ram p at a charter school because our school board lives in terror of a menacing , forgiving glow cloud that rains dead animals and spreads dreadful and false memories . likewise , there is a girl who is only a hand . and she needs a computer to help her be part of our community . and if allowing a treacherous machine to dismantled our municipal power grid , and telephone lines , and satellites , and radius can help her ? well , count me in ! thank you for listening to others . thank you for ca ring for others . stay tuned next for a predetermined series of unchangeable events which will shape the rest of your script ed life . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : thank you for your interest in a life free of pain . we are not accepting applications at this time . please try again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again ...
WTNV|Lazy Day|15 November 2013|no one has seen the trees this week . hopefully , they ' ll come back soon . welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . nothing much to say about this day in night vale . today is just a lazy day in our beautiful little town . the heat is unusually strong for this time of year , assuming you believe in concepts like time , and year , and unusual . flies are buzzing around and around a trash can somewhere . frances donelson – manager of the antique mall – is waving listlessly at a wall of old items ready to be bought anew , her hand a slow signal of submission to inactivity . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home is finding herself click ing the same apology webster she has read a million times . i , myself , am plumped against this desk , murdering into this microphone , too tired by the heat to give more than a token effort to the work of my life . ours is a quiet now . no one is speaking but me . if speaking took me any energy , if it were not merely a reflex of my living form , then i , myself , would not be speaking either . carlos – perfectly imperfect carlos – is the only one feeling industrious today . he ' s mowing the lawn , and whistling . and the lawn is whistling back . and now the news , i guess . alert citizens from all over night vale are reporting a man in a ta n jacket standing behind the ta co bell , near the dumpster and the constantly-ringing pay phone . he is plucking insects out of the air , and snuffing them into his bearskin suitcase . alert citizens report that they do not remember what his nimble hands look like , and many of them lost track of what they were saying mid-sentence , lapsing into a gaped-mouth silence . all of them received one stamp on their alert citizen card . as always , five stamps means stop sign immunity for a year ! also , congratulations to jake fascia , who has completely filled up three alert citizen cards , thus giving him the mandatory right to disappear forever ! his entire family , in a statement given in monotony unison , said that they were proud , and that they did not miss him much , really . remember what secret police ma scot , barks ennui , always says : ` ` citizens be alert ! but not too alert , there is much that you should not see . only you can prevent your own house mysteriously catching on fire . woof woof ! '' oh , i bet barks is such a cut e little cartoon dog . maybe someday the secret police will classify what he looks like . update on the summer reading program from a couple of months ago : those children who made it out of the library alive – blooded , covered in the gut s of librarian , and clutching reading lists far in advance of their grade level – have formed an organized militia under the leadership of fellow survivor , 12 year-old tamika lynn . they have taken to conducting drills out in the sand wastes , hundreds of children shouting and moving in unison , as tamika stands over them on a hilltop , watching for their weakness , encouraging their strength . tamika has taken to wearing the detached hand of a librarian around her neck as a warning to any who would dare face her that she has already defeated the most wearisome creature imaginable . when reached for comment , tamika said , ` ` we do not look around . we do not look inside . we do not sleep . our god is not a smiling god , and we are ready for this war . '' when asked to clarify , she challenged our reporter to a hundred days of hand-to-hand combat , which our reporter declined by running away screaming , pursued by hundreds of battle-hardened children . it ' s still just a lazy day here in night vale . mayor pamela mitchell called a press conference , and then did not speak . she sat on a folding chair next to the podium , her head lolled back , taking a brief nap , before getting up and jumping – folding chair in hand – though a small glowing portal she created in mid-air . all of this would have been quite rude to the attending reporter , if a single one of them had actually attended , but they called a press conference of their own to announce that they were just going to take the rest of the day off , if that was ok ; that the still afternoon sunlight was somehow more conducive to a gentle rest than the dark cradle of night . no one showed up to that press conference , either . carlos has vacuum his living room , and is now organizing his closets . he ' s holding up items and making decisions . he is humming . the grass can not hum , and so is silent . the vague , yet menacing , government agency would like to remind you that for are totally not a thing . they remind you that for are merely weather balloons . and further , that weather balloons are merely misplaced clouds . that clouds are merely dreams that have escaped our sleep . that sleep is merely a practice for death . that death is merely another facet of our world – no different from , say , sand or bicycle – and that the great glowing earth is merely the last thoughts of a dying man , laughing and shaking his head weakly at the probability of it all . remember , it ' s not just the law , it ' s an illusion ! thanksgiving is just around the corner , and you know what that means ! it means it ' s time for us to go traveling to the brown stone spire , thanking it for all that it has done , and all that it has mercifully not done ! this is just a great time to get the family together , eat your fill , then crawl out through the sharp rocks and sand until your knees leave blood streaks on the barren earth , and you feel the brown stone spire loom up before you . but you dare not look . you dare not look . ` ` thank you , '' you whisper . ` ` thank you , thank you , '' more plea than prayer , more fear than gratitude . and if it accepts what you have to say , you and your family can return to your homes – shaking , safe , together . shaking . together . and if it does not accept what you say ? it does not really matter what happens after that , does it ? i mean , would knowing make it any easier ? no . knowing never does . the brown stone spire . give thanks . cry out thanks . scream thanks . and now , a word from our sponsors . today ' s broadcast is brought to you by costo . how much could a body even weigh ? in addition , today ' s broadcast is brought to you by waves of sound , that are somehow carried by a form of light , and that a machine is turning into an invisible man talking to you , intimately , quietly , into your ear . that does not seem natural to us . strexcorp synernists , inch distrust all that you previously trusted . this day , in which nothing happens , continues to not . even bodily functions are taking the day off . reports are coming in that hearts are failing to beat , lungs failing to inflated , the muscles of the arms and legs turning to a loose , relaxed jelly . people are falling dead in the street – suddenly blue , suddenly seizing , spit dribbling from their lips in tiny pools of foam and mud in the sand , loved ones looking on without the energy needed to weep . just nothing much of any kind going on . a lazy , lazy day . our favorite local cereal company , flaky-os , is gear ing up to announce their newest big product : imaginary corn flakes . the cereal chefs down at flaky-os are taking only the sweetest , most non-carcinogenic cob s of imaginary corn , supplied by john peters – you know , the farmer . they are dis tilling that imaginary taste down to a crisp , flavor-packed imaginary corn flake , ready for you to eat out of a big bowl of milk . ` ` we are very excited about this product , '' said miranda yes pie of the new flaky-os board of directors . ` ` we are thrilled to be working with john peters – you know , the farmer ? – i mean , as soon as we can find him . has anyone seen him ? he ' s become as hard to locate as his corn ! '' miranda also said that there are no plans to do vital marketing involving a sentiment , trans-dimensional pyramid , as the costs on that last one were just too high . ` ` i mean , we had nothing to do with that , '' she said . ` ` but if we did , then we might say that a certain sentiment pyramid really got an out sized ego after one simple vital marketing campaign , and started making unreasonable demands , like a trans-dimensional trailer , on location , that is normalized on the outside , but contains within it vast , looming spaces . impossible . endless . also health benefits . so if that were the case , we would probably have had to let the sentiment pyramid go . '' miranda then thanked us for attending the announcement , and dug her way back into the flaky-os offices using her large , claw-like paws . and now , traffic . a few drops of ice melt , almost invisible as they slide down great slabs of mountain rock , joining together into a slight trickle , the mere suggestion of movement and water . that suggestion becoming more clear , clear water . clearly moving in a clear trickle downwards , forming with others into a stream . a stream rolling over pebbles and around debris , hardly any force behind it , but implacable in its searching out of lower ground . and then , gasping from some height , as a splash , into a river . a deep river churning its way through a landscape , drawing boundaries over which wars can later be fought . slamming against boulders with violence , but without malice . becoming wider , slower , like a human settling into the better part of age . a river that only shows evidence of movement when it carries some other thing , some life , upon it – like a human settling into the better part of age . and finally , one last exit . a great engulfing by an ocean , in which all water is the same water . in which we can finally find some rest – like a human , settling into the better . like a human , settling . this has been traffic . and the lazy day continues . a ne on sign advertising the world ' s best burgers blinks uselessly in the glaring haze of the sun , its light as small as the probability of its claim . the earth is starting to slow its rotation , joining in on the mass malaise . magnetic fields are going crazy . they are the only things going crazy . everything else is completely mellow ed out . those people with still-functioning hearts and lungs are lounging around , saying ` ` oh h , huh , who cares ? '' and ` ` what a bother ! '' when presented with stimulus or thought . the earth is slowing . gravity is slack ing off . my mi c is floating . carlos is also floating , and he ' s taking this opportunity to clean out the gutter on his roof . how industrious ! how ... uuuugh , i do not really have the energy to think of another word . radio waves are reacting strangely to the loss of gravity , the change in magnet ism as the earth slows . so , if you are having difficulty receiving this message , we apologize , but ... wo not do anything about it . doing things , right ? movement , know ? existing ? do you see what i mean ? oh , what ' s that ? inter maureen is flicking her eyes up in her otherwise motionless face . her mouth is set into a deep lo ll . her cheeks are slack . i believe she is indicating something , i suppose i should turn my head and look ... i suppose . oh . oh , all right , here i go ! listeners , i am engaging the muscles in my neck and i am turning my head . ah h ah h , i see . the sun is going out . yes . a black tumor of darkness , of absence , is on the face of the brightness . the brightness is dimming . the source of all life is going , is joining the rest of us in taking today to do nothing . that ' s probably not good . we should probably do something about that . but ... it ' s like ... well , anyway . at least i got to see how breaking bad ended . and now i do not so much take you , as just kind of leave you – just kind of disappear and gently judge you towards , in the heart of a world that soon wo not be , the weather . welcome back . welcome back ! i guess , from a crisis . welcome back from , i guess , a crisis . how was it solved ? how was the day saved ? it was not . it did not need to be . there are lulls and gaps , and rests , and stops . but this world stumbled on . the sun flared back , the world restarted . still bodies , blue in the gray street , gasped suddenly , and rose back into the blue-gray light of day . we wake up , we move on . no state is our state forever . all is fleeting . frances donelson , manager of the antique mall , has gone back to violently smashing her stock of old items , as is usual . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home has gone back to flitting around in the corner of your eye , rearranging your belongings according to some unknown purpose . the flies are still buzzing around that trash can , but with more ver ve . more zest . inter maureen brought me some coffee . ah h ! yeah , that ' s helping . coffee helps sometimes , though , does not it ? other times , it just makes things worse . i mean , everything does . business is booming , people are moving , events transporting . all as usual , all returning . we are up ! we are full of energy ! we are ready for the next great thing to be made for us , and delivered to us , and done to us ! carlos , meanwhile , says he ' s had a busy day and might take a nap now . that ... well , that sounds nice . listeners , i think now is the time at which i must say goodby . there ' s a place here in night vale . a place i d like to be just now . maybe my lazy day is not quite done after all . stay tuned next for a keeping howl , a scratch at the door , a hood falling suddenly over your face , and a delicious roasted square recipe your family will just love ! good night , night vale ! good night ! today ' s proverb : on this day in history : mundanity , and terror , and food , and love , and trees .
WTNV|Missing|1 December 2013|red sky at night . sailor ' s delight . red sky at night , the sailors are howling and laughing . the sailors begin to surround us , and the night sky is so very red . welcome to night vale . listeners , i hate to start our program off with sad news , but our new station owner – strexcorp – handed me a missing child alert right as i walked into the studio . ` ` strexcorp is asking night vale citizens to be on the lookout for tamika lynn , age 13. she is described as 5 ' 1 '' , stocky build , black hair and dark eyes . dark . so dark . so wise beyond time . so deep in their understanding that to gaze into them is to gaze into your own death . it is not important where she was last seen or by whom . why do you need to know that ? why are you asking so many questions ? you are taking valuable time away from important and highly-fulfilling work at your place of employment , '' the missing child report reads . ` ` stexcorp asks that anyone with any knowledge about tamika lynn ' s whereabouts should contact strexcorp headquarters by picking up a phone , and talking . do not worry , you ' re not hard to find . '' i asked my new supervisor , daniel , why it ' s strexcorp that is issuing a missing child alert , and not tamika lynn ' s family or the sheriff ' s secret police . but he just started shaking , and spark ing , and humming . then the halfway got too cloudy and i could not breathe , and my show was starting , so i left him alone . he ' s still standing at the studio window , staring at me , twitching , sparks subsiding , but his mouth has fallen open revealing ... is that motor oil ? tar ? i do not know . but it ' s going to be hard to concentrate if he does not leave . let ' s go now to the community calendar . tuesday , there ' s a false start . a mistaken understanding of time . tuesday , we will wake , and walk to our normal places – our shower , kitchens , cars , desk – only to find the day never began . we will slowly notice an absence of all matter , all light , all time . and then , as suddenly as we false-started , we will begin our actual day . and everything will happen the same . only , because of our awareness of it all , it will happen differently . less differently at first , but more differently later . wednesday will take forever . for-eeeeeeevvvvvveeeerrrrr . not literally , but very near literally . ugh ! wednesday has not even gotten here , and i already want it over with ! thursday , a faint outline of a dull face will appear in the dark as you try to sleep . you will notice its blank stare ; its straight , expressionless lips ; its thick brow ; and the subtle hint of slow collected breaths . it will seem to be watching you , curious about you , as if it were not from here . it is not from here . you will lock eyes . you will barely be able to make out the face ' s humanoid features but you will know , deep down , it is not human . not human at all . ` ` what does it want ? '' you will think . probably nothing . let it go . get some sleep . friday is an open house at the night vale community college . thinking of further ing your education ? considering taking winter smelter classes ? well , it ' s a trap ! do not go near the night vale community college this friday . ha ! nice try , giant worms , but we know your tricks ! faking a community college open house is very obvious , do not you think ? i mean , it was a nice touch , creating a fake press release to get into various news outlets like ours , but we see through you ! no , we really do . your skin is translucent , and it ' s kind of gross . no offense . saturday , everyone is their own person . you are free to disregard others and recognize yourself as one , for once . pour some wine , draw a bath , light some incense , and grab a city-approved novel . it ' s your time . sunday will be full of regret . also , joy . also , laughter . also , conversation . also , long stretches of memorable moments . it will mostly be that last thing . in your old age , as you look back on your life , if someone were to ask what happened on that sunday – you remember , that one sunday , with the regret , and joy , and laughter , and conversation – if someone were to ask you that , you would be hard-pressed to come up with a single memorable moment from this coming sunday . this has been the community calendar . an update on our missing child report : we just received world that 13 year-old tamika lynn is not missing . this word came from tamika herself . witnesses said they saw tamika standing at op the pedestal of one of this town ' s most historical works of art : the 138 year-old bronze statue of actor lee margin , just outside the night vale post office . tamika told a gathered crowd that she was not missing , she has never been missing . she clarified that she has always been where she has been , she has always been from where she is from , and she will always be going where she is going . witnesses reported that tamika had a canvas to te bag full of heavy stones over her left shoulder , a worn-out copy of will cat her ' s death comes for the archbishop in her right rear parts pocket , and that she was still holding the severed head of the librarian she defeated so valiantly in august , saving our town and all of the participants of the library ' s treacherous summer reading program . as yellow helicopter began to approach her , tamika shouted to the gathered crowd to stop looking for her . ` ` i am found ! i am found ! i am found ! '' she repeated dramatically , rhythmically , the crowd swaying and moved by her homiletic passion . ` ` stop looking for me , and find yourself ! '' she was last heard crying over the crescent of helicopter landing . the remaining crowd , still singing her phrases , still undiluted , inadvertently blocked the strexcorp agents from reaching tamika before she disappeared in plain sight . strexcorp has issued , just moments ago , several dozen more missing child reports . they say children keep going missing . and they bet that if you find one specific child , one specific , very determined , and difficult child ( and they mean that in the best possible way ) , if you find that one child , you will probably find all of the missing children . strexcorp is asking that if anyone has seen tamika lynn , to contact them immediately . ` ` she is a missing child . and should not you care about that ? should not you care about the children ? '' strexcorp asked . ` ` children are the future , '' they added . ` ` i wish you felt the same way and would help us find this ... this ... child , '' they stammered , looking slightly agitated . more on this , soon . let ' s have a look now at traffic . there ' s a man . imagine him . he ' s leaning on a fence , shortness and weary . he seems wise near the eyes , but his impatient feet suggest insidiousness . he ' s marked with dried mud , and maybe some very deep but quickly-healing cuts – from the tree branches , most likely , or perhaps the birds . ok , i ' m not telling you the whole truth . it was definitely the birds . imagine these cuts and scratches , dry and brittle now , but tender to the touch . he is certain he did not offend the birds , but he is uncertain whether his complacency was construed as equal to said offense . picture this . picture the man leaning on the criss-crossing metal wires , waiting . the birds are gone , but other things are coming . he does not know specifically what , but he knows it ' ll come for him . you know this , too , because i have told you . the man says nothing . there ' s never not something that has been displaced , marginalized . there ' s never not something that , when feeling pressed to the wall , to a place with no room left to run , gathers its numbers , gathers its forces , and turns , savagely , on its oppressors . turns viciously , and without inhibition , even on those who merely look like its oppressors . do you catch my meaning ? can you imagine the scene i am explaining ? how much of the world makes sense to you ? what does it mean to be a hero ? to be a human ? the man thinks about his heart . it beats . it beats normally . earlier , it did not beat normally . think about your own heart . is it beating normally ? listen . i ' ll give you a long moment . how is your heart ? do you remember the man ? the one on the fence , shortness and scarred , with the normally-beating heart ? he ' s not real . take him out of the story , but leave the story . take him out , leave the story . do you catch my meaning ? do you ? this has been traffic . and now , a word from our sponsor . deep , deep , deep in the grass , grass , grass , what grows , grows , grows ? who knows , knows , knows ? strex . strrrrrexxx ! strrrrrrrrrrrrrrexxxxxx ! strexcorp synernists , inch working hard so you can work harder . work harder . seriously . work . harder . strexcorp . get to work ! more now on the missing children story . several helmet ed and sunglassed helicopter pilots have stepped forward to announce that they had nothing to do with the missing children . sheila nowitzky , a pilot for one of the many black helicopter that are routine curling night vale , said she ' s a harmless spy from the world government , and would never harm an american child without a direct order . marco padilla , a pilot for one of the many blue sheriff ' s secret police coppers , said nothing – but you could see in his face he meant no harm to our kid s . and a shadowy haze that claimed , through telepathy , to be the pilot of one of the mysterious helicopter with elaborate morals depicting birds of prey diving , admitted that , while their helicopter were the ones that took away all the children in night vale several weeks ago , they brought them back . ` ` they brought them back , ok ? and they ' re fine . get off of me ! '' the humid gray haze emphasized . ` ` god , you take a bunch of kid s one time . one time ! gee ! '' listeners , today i want to talk to you about the dangers of deer . are they beautiful ? yes . are they graceful and picturesque , even bordering majestic beasts ? yes , yes , and yes . and , are they helpful to the community because real estate agents live inside of them ? of course ! but deer are also dangerous creatures . they are terrible , deceitful , and vile animals . i ' m not being mean , this is just basic science . look , i know deer are cut e and friendly-looking . we all remember adorable little bambi , from the classic animated movie , with his sweet voice and white freckled rum p . but we also remember the bloody end that he wrought on the humans at the end of the film , the graphics headings , and trees streaked with go re during the famous revenge-fueled climax . the lesson of that movie , as in life itself , is that nature is gorgeous , and it is horrible , and it will kill you . this has been the children ' s fun fact science corner . this just in : oh my , uh , some disastrous news ! quite terrible ! there has been a helicopter crash out by the old car lot . witnesses report hearing youthful shouts and screams , followed by loud metallic clanging . they saw smoke trailing across the cold , dark afternoon sky ( because , of course , the sun again did not rise today ) . they saw a yellow mangle of metal , and rotors , and – um , listeners ? daniel is still standing at my studio door . he has stopped staring . he is now yelling , but ... without noise . he looks very upset . i can read his lips . he is saying , ` ` turn it off . shut it down . no more news today . we are shutting you down ? '' they ' re going to turn off my microphone , night vale ! um , i ' ve locked the door , which will buy me some time while daniel goes to find a security guard with keys . so let me take you now , for as long as it can last , to the weather . listeners ? i do not know if you can hear me . i am only trusting that i did this right . i wired my phone into the soundboard , and then wired the soundboard into the radio tower , which is running on axillary power . it ' s , um , a cool trick my childhood best friend earl harlan taught me back when we were in boy scouts together , earning our subversive radio host badge . i doubt daniel , or any of the new station management , can hear me as they do not like listening to radio shows . also , i ' m hiding up on the roof with my makeshift studio . during the weather , i got word from some witnesses at the helicopter accident . the sheriff ' s secret police found several large slingshots and heavy stones nearby that matched , in size and shape , the dents on the helicopter ' s engine ca sing . they also found a well-worn and heavily-notated copy of death comes for the archbishop by will cat her . inside the book was a bookmark , marking page 267. on that page was the underlined phrase , ` ` i shall not die of a cold , my son . i shall die of having lived . '' and on the bookmark was a handwritten note . it said , ` ` your pilot is fine . she is ours now . she will return when she is ready , but she will return better . t.f . '' i do not know if that t.f . stands for our missing girl – our brilliant , and bold , and missing girl . if station management is listening , i , of course , hope we find tamika lynn and bring her home safely . i hope that she will find you first , that is . remember what i said , listeners , about the traffic ? about the birds ? think on that . think on lots of things . think about heroes , and whether we should even need them . the answer is , we do not . i sometimes wish i could tell you more , but i can not . i can not tell you everything i think you should hear because it is ... boring . or , it is unnecessary . or it is very necessary , but approved . there are many reasons i can not always tell you what i want to tell you , but the main reason is that you need to find it out for yourself . i could preach , and teach , and shout , and explain , but no lesson is as powerful as the lesson learned on one ' s own . you can do it ! you do not need old cecil telling you what ' s happening in town . no . i just report the news . i just arrange it . you figure it out . you learn from it . you take action . you create the meaning . it is all up to you . and , given my current broadcast ing situation , it may be up to you for a long time . i d better get downstairs before they discover what i ' m doing . stay tuned next for silence , self-reflection , and a long pause to hear yourself think . use that silence well . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : look , up in the sky ! it ' s a bird ! it ' s a plane ! no , it ' s just the void . infinite and indifferent . we are so small . so very , very small .
WTNV|The Auction|15 December 2013|velvet darkness . silken light . the rough burlap of evening . the frayed cotton of daybreak . welcome to night vale . first off , welcome back ! everything is fine . nothing happening , if you know what i mean . you should not know what i mean . if you do know , you should forget . i ' m not going to mention anything , and you ' re not going to hear anything . and both of us will fail to remember . no one will be named . nothing will be referenced . and so ... listeners , today is an exciting and important day in night vale . the sheriff ' s secret police are holding their annual auction of contraband and seized property to benefit their purchase of balloons , birthday candles , yellow cake , and a pirate . they hope to raise $ 7.3 million dollars , and they say the pirate is armor ed , and will be used to crush rebellion . personally , i love the annual auction . you never know what sort of fun stuff might come up . the catalogue has so many interesting items ! u mm , let ' s see ... lot 1 is an all-clad dinnerware set . eight pans , in cast aluminium for perfect distribution of heat . new in the package . it ' s just waiting for you to season it with a doll op of olive oil and start cooking for friends and family – regardless of how no one comes over anymore after the last dinner party , when your mother drank all the chi anti and announced you never lived up to your potential . at least , that ' s what the description of the lot says . lot 2 is a glowing coin with the image of a grim , horned god on the obverse , and a half-collapsed panopticon on the reverse . it ' s been graded ms-45 by the sheriff ' s secret police coin grading service , which in no way collides with the sheriff ' s secret police auction house to inflated the grade , and thus the value of the coin . lot 3 is a silver candelabra that once floated across a series of dining rooms-turned-abattoirs , to better illuminate the flying daggers that accompanied it . lot 4 is a set of flying daggers , with maniacally-detailed designs on the shaft collars . knife collectors and maniac alike will want to bid on those . do not get in the way of that bidding war ! hata . let ' s see ... there are also carpets , and some mid-century modern furniture . oh ! these are very stylish . and look ! lot 17 is a near-mint copy of uncanny x-men # 3 , 1964. it has slight fox ing on the back cover , perfect registration of the color separation , off-white pages , restless staples , high cover gloss , and no marvel shipping , and it features the first appearance of the blow – not the blow who lives in the housing development out back of the elementary school , the fiction al one . what else ? lot 37 is ... u mm ... cecil palmer . there is no description . listeners , we ' ll have more on this auction as it develops . on the lighter side of the news : today , an invincible , all-powerful alien presence with telepathic powers came to night vale to enslaved us all . it planned to bend every sentiment being to its will , ending violence and conflict by subjugation all of us to its omniscience , telekinetic powers . hilariously , this all-powerful but bumbling alien presence did not know we were already subjugated to the omniscience force that ' s been controlling our thoughts for years ! we ' re guaranteed to continue our violent and irrational ways , so ... in your face , inert newcomer presence ! toddlers of night vale ! the night vale community pre-school invites you to fulfill your potential ! commit to a new and demanding educational curriculum , while exploring your ultimate dream – the same dream that every toddler has : economic opportunity . that ' s right ! you too can learn to be a chimney sweep . clean the many , many chimneys of leading citizen – and friendly millionaire – marcus vanston . what a good man marcus vanston is ! every one of his houses , from his smallest penthouse apartment at op the dirigible hang ar , to his 46-room hilltop estate , has multiple chimneys . he has built chimneys even in places where he has no houses , so his well-deserved carbon credits can go to good use . there are numerous chimneys on his shopping mall , his office buildings , his dirigible , his moon rock-plated recreational vehicles , and – due to new and creative laws that allow eminent domain for the generous marcus vanston – every other house in town as well . he has strapped traveling chimneys onto the pushcarts of festive peddlers , whose rags , hunched shoulders , nagging cough , and forced tin-whistle merriment accompany the sad antics of their emaciated vest and marching band cap-wearing capuchin monkeys holding tin cups , rattling with a single penny from some defect , outmoded currency , asking us to contribute to their upkeep , as we turn up our collars , clear our throats , and make convenient excuses to walk a little faster until , instead of embarrassment about their fates , we find our way to feeling superior about our fragile position on the economic ladder . marcus vanston understands . he does not want you to be a lowly peddler ! or a capuchin monkey ! he wants you to be a chimney sweep . so , little ones , lower your standards ! smother your dreams in carbon , and en roll in the pre-school chimney sweep academy . make good-old marcus vanston happy , for a few brief moments . an update on our earlier story : violence has broken out among bidder in the sheriff ' s secret police auction . bidding has been frantic , and angry . it is confirmed that there has been hair-pulling . unfortunately , attended have been using their bidding paddles to slap each other across the face – a motion the auctioneer has been repeatedly mistaking as indication as a new bid . thus , lot 1 , the all-clad dinnerware set , sold for $ 175,000 – and that ' s before the buyer ' s premium . listeners , i have been in touch with the auction staff about lot 37 , which is of a certain interest to me . i want lot 37 ! i want it badly ! i asked if they might take a photograph and send it to me . well ... the peals of laughter that broke out in response were a cross between sleigh bells and the cackle of hunched , gray-faced court jesters . you know how that sounds . listeners , in order to learn more about lot 37 , it ' s likely i will need to visit the auction myself . more as it develops . the night vale mayor al race is heating up in preparation for the mayor al election this next june . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home has taken to leaving leaflets inside the wiring and pipes of your appliances , to be found when the spark ing and the shaking become so much that you must hire , or capture , a repair person . the leaflets are tastefully designed , with an anatomically-detailed drawing of a sparrow ' s heart , and the simple slogan : ` ` you are fragile , and blind , and wanting , and stepping alone into the great darkness of the future . '' it also has her five-point policy platform , which is mostly interesting facts she has learned about bees . meanwhile , hiram mcdaniels , in the interest of saving time , has taken to standing on corners giving five different campaign speeches – one with each of his heads . his heads have radically different personalities , and agenda , leading to some discord in their messages . but they all agree that they would like to be elected , that youth sports programs are important , and that the time of the liza rd will soon be upon the helpless human race . oh ! and speaking of the goodhearted and great-walleted marcus vanston , he has also thrown his hat into the proverbial ring . he actually constructed a special proverbial ring in the middle of town , with an lcd light display and a fountain with hour ly waterspout show , and commissioned a gold-plated hat , with remote-controlled hat launched , for just that purpose . as the hat flew into the ring , a 40-piece children ' s choir sang a song composed for the occasion , tit led , ` ` hi , i ' m running too , i guess . oh , i ' m marcus vanston , whatever . anyway , i ' m going to be mayor , thanks . '' many tears were shed by onlookers – due to civic pride , and some helpful gas marcus had added to the air supply . well , this is starting to look like a mayor al campaign for the ages ! when reached for comment , outdoing mayor pamela mitchell showed us a collection of moss es , and explained the songs that must be sung to each of them for proper growth . hey kid s . ever go walking in the woods and wonder whether a fairy ring of mushrooms is poisonous ? well , look at its center . if there is a body no older than yourself lying there , the ring is perfectly fine . if the body is also screaming , the ring is perfectly fine . everything is perfectly fine ! there is nothing under your bed , there is nothing in your closet . your parents are , most likely , actually your parents , regardless of what the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home might tell you . do not fear the black helicopter , or the black windowless school bu ses that circle your block at night . you need not be afraid of the bogeyman . there has not been a sight ing of a bogeyman for several months – or at least a couple weeks . and yes , you will die – but probably not until everyone you know is already dead , too . your parents , your friends , your pets ... each death leaving a small but irreparable scar on your not-yet-still , still-beating heart . the living tell the dying not to leave , and the dying do not listen . the dying tell us not to be sad for them , and we do not listen . the dialogue between the living and the dead is full of misunderstanding and silence . there ' s nothing to fear in oblivion – unless , of course , your consciousness survives death . if so , it would be reasonable to fear the sensation of consciousness without senses , suspended alone in the cosmos , with no one to hear you , and no way to make yourself known . no reference point for counting time – a count that does not matter anyway in a literal eternity . you might wish that you still had a corporal form , only so that you could make your mouth move to express your terror , to make the universal form of a terrified scream , the form of a letter of but you wo not be able to . you just wo not ! this has been the children ' s fun fact science corner , brought to you by shame , loneliness , and the letter of i have been told , listeners , that the auction has descended into chaos . michelle nguyen , owner of dark owl records , having bid on a sealed box of el vis pressed 45 s , opened the box to find it was in fact a box of el vis pressed ' s .45-caliber revolvers . the up ended box has made bidding much more treacherous . mayor pamela mitchell , interested in lot 28 – a gently-used cup coffee maker – has begun laying down suppressing fire over the ducked heads of anyone trying to out bid her . despite this , i must enter the auction house myself , taking my life into my hands even more than usual . lot 37. cecil palmer . i must know . i must bid ! i go now , listeners , to await the crying of lot 37. as i go , you go , to the weather . listeners , many complications ensued during my attempt to bid on lot 37. first , in registering for the auction , i had to indicate my current income – which is made difficult , as our new owners ( who i have been asked to stop talking about ) are now paying us in scrip , redeemable only at merchants they own , like dust hut or the ralph ' s . luckily , the sheriff ' s secret police turns out to be one of those select merchants . i was able to get a paddle , only moments before the bidding on lot 37 began . when confronted with destiny , there are external events to record , yes ... but also internal . i would say , time slowed down even more than usual . the edges of the room went flurry , and then went , completely . there was a deep throb of distant machinery that i realized was my own heart repelling inadequate amounts of blood through my parched and aching body . if i did not win lot 37 i would be ... unraveled . perhaps i would be unraveled either way . the dull ache i felt was a prima ache of completion , the separation an infant feels when pulled too soon from its mother ' s embrace . my cheeks flushed with the irrationally of desire . i needed lot 37. i counted my breaths . i judged myself for wanting , and judged myself wanting . i focused on those parts of my life completely out of my control in order to calm myself down , drowning my fears in pleasant helplessness . the up shot is , i forgot to raise my paddle . oh ! oh , foolish cecil ! and through the tears that came then to my eyes , i could not see who won lot 37 with only one bid ! winner of lot 37 , if you ' re listening , on one hand i wish you good luck with your prize . on the other , i will be using the mightiest bully pulpit of all , community radio , to strike back at you and destroy you ! but also , congratulations . also that . i am authorized to tell you that the sheriff ' s secret police have declared the auction a resounding success . in celebration , they deployed the pirate to the screams – presumably delighted – of everyone in attendance . the winning bidder walked away grinning , laden down with trinkets and trophies that reassured them with the cleverness of sheer acquisition . the sheriff ' s secret police went on to say that objects are invested with ma na , magic power caused by the dangerous ideas of property and ownership . and holding onto them is our attempt at having something that will never let us down , even though eventually all will . people leave . parents leave the room . lovers leave your life . you leave the world . we clutch teddy bears first , then dolls , then sports jersey , and automobile with hand-sewn leather and excellent gas mileage . as if that were something permanent . the sheriff ' s secret police gave a great cheer in honor of constant decay , and the inevitability of abandonment . listeners , accumulation objects is just a way , we hope , to turn back the grim specter of death . thank you for your participation in this auction , and for your hope that making a certain purchase – all-clad cooking ware , a candelabra , a comic book , a community radio show host – would render you anything more than mortal . i go now to find myself , or to find who has myself , or to find someone that might make me feel better about what has happened today . i d take that last one , honestly . i d take that honest , last one . and so , dear listeners , and whatever unknown person or entity that is now the owner of lot 37 , i bid you a farewell – the fondness of which is determined by your place relative to mine in my heart . stay tuned next for our popular home medical program , yes , that ' s probably cancer . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : listen , i ' m not a hero . the real heroes are the people that point out to us when protesters have smart phone , thus invalidating all concerns .
WTNV|Orange Grove|1 January 2014|you take the good , you take the bad . you take them both , and there you have spiders crawling out of a red velvet cup cake . welcome to night vale . we start today ' s show with some exciting agricultural news . john peters – you know , the farmer ? – said his winter orange crop is outstanding this year ! he said there are oranges everywhere ! delicious clementines , juice valencias , rich novels , and bold blood oranges . john said there are so many oranges , ` ` a real bump er crop , '' he said . ` ` a real orange-tacular , '' he did not say . ` ` a real orange-a-thon , '' he never would have said . ` ` a real orange-ocalypse , '' he may have thought , but kept to himself . john , speaking to a pack of local reporter , and backed by a group of farmers wearing black double-breasted suits and red silk ties , said this is the dawning of a new citrus economy in night vale . john said , ` ` citrus is our future . citrus holds the key to prosperity . citrus holds the key to health . one particular orange here literally holds the key to a one-sided door in the middle of the desert . if you find that orange , '' john said , ` ` i will pay you dearly for it . '' ` ` or rather , '' john corrected himself , ` ` you will pay dearly for it . '' then john said , ` ` either way , whatever . would love to have that orange , my friend . would love to have that orange . lesser ! '' he punctured . ` ` or madam . or neither . i mean , whoever . sure would love to have that orange , '' he chuckled while sweating and adjusting his wooden hat . john then tossed some oranges to the reporter . the reporter caught the oranges , and then began to disappear . and reappear . blinking in and out of existence , quickly at first , then slowly , then more out of existence than in , until they were all gone . more on this story as it develops . the city council announced today that they just ca not be here anymore . they said this in unison , standing in a cramped meeting room , and wearing tiny rectangular sun glasses . they added that they wish us all the best in our final weeks . then , they made the standard american sign language ` ` i love you '' gesture as smoke filled the room . witnesses said the smoke smelled of map le , and was a little bring , but not unpleasantly so . when the haze cleared , the city council was still standing in the room , apologizing , claiming , ` ` this usually works . '' and then , no longer speaking in unison , casting blame on each other for not believing hard enough , and that if it were not for so-and-so they d all be on a beach somewhere safe from the bears or ... whatever those things are . when asked for an explanation about the bears ... or whatever those things are , the council simply whispered in unison , ` ` mistakesssss ! '' no follow-up questions were asked , as reporter became physically and emotional occupied with the dozens of agitated startings that began pouring from the air condition ing duct . you know , listeners , i ' ve been thinking about john peters ' orange grove . i did a little digging online and found that orange trees are not native to deserts . i also email ed my boyfriend , carlos , about this . he ' s a scientist , which kind of makes me a scientist , too . here ' s carlos ' email back to me just now : ` ` cecil , i ' ll do my best to answer your questions , but do know that i do not specialized in botany or dendrology . i am a scientist . i study science , not plants or nature . ` ` i did drive out past john ' s farm a month ago , and there was not a single tree ; just acres and acres of rocky , cracked , flat ground . there ' s no way he could have grown anything natural on that land , let alone a bountiful orange grove ... especially in just a few weeks . ` ` as far as your other question goes , let ' s stay home tonight . we ate out last night . plus , there ' s a new documentary about scatterplot matrices on netflix i ' ve been wanting to see . also , the man who shot liberty balance is on tbs again . we could re-watch that . i ' ll make pa sta , if you can pick up some ... '' uhmm , et cet era , et cet era , et cet era , carlos goes on about weekend bowl ing plans , y you know what ? you do not need all this . ok . i think that ' s all he had about the orange trees . i do hope we watch liberty balance , though . ha ! i love that film . and now , a word from our sponsors . tired of waiting in line at the post office ? scared of the unexplained blood pouring from the p.o . boxes ? confused by screams that no one else hears ? terrified of leaving your home ? try stamps.com . with stamps.com , you can print your own postage and avoid the long lines and predator birds so common at the post office . you can even have your postal carrier pick up your packages , as long as you are careful never to look the carrier in the eyes , as this is a sign of aggression and you may scare your postal carrier away . stamps.com has a special offer for night vale community radio listeners . sign up today and receive a bag of magic rocks , $ 50 worth of self loathing , and a free scale – so you can arbitrarily assign numbers to material objects . to claim your new member benefits , simply visit stamps.com , and press your forehead against the radio mi c in the upper-right of your screen until your entire body falls forwards into the alternate stamps.com universe . stamps.com will tell your family you loved them very much . stamps.com will tell your family that stamps.com loves them very much . ` ` come here , family . you are all our family now , '' stamps.com will say , stretching their many boneless arms around your terrified family . ` ` come here . we are all loving family .

' s of , where the o in of is a bright cartoons sun with big pink eyes , and a strained tooth smile ; and the j is a sickle the sun is using to slice down ripe oranges from a large tree . adam ba yer , week day shift manager at the ralph ' s , said they have removed all other produce to stock j.p. oranges , and even emptied out the refrigerator to fully showcase all of j.p. ' s mouth-watering stock of fresh juice . ` ` even several of the dry goods aisles had to be cleared out , '' adam said , pulling oranges from his apron pockets . he continued pulling oranges from his tiny pocket , mesmerized by their seeming infinite , and unable to continue speaking as he began to blink out of existence . listeners , we here at night vale community radio need to offer the following correction : in a previous broadcast , we described the world as ` ` real . '' we indicated , using our voice , that it was made up of many real objects and entities , and we gave descriptions of these disparage parts . we even went so far as to ascribe action and agency to some of these entities . but , as we all know , nothing can be fully understood to be ` ` real . '' any description of the world we give is simply the world we experience – which is to say , a narrative we force onto whatever horror or void lies behind the scrim of our perception . we at the station offer our deepest , most humble apologies for the previous , erroneous , report . we affirm once again that nothing is real – including this correction , and least of all , your experience of hearing it . this has been corrections . more now on the orange grove . inter maureen brought it to my attention that until today , john peters – you know , the farmer ? – has been missing for about four months ! former inter dana was the last to see him . unfortunately , we do not know where dana was when she saw him . we ' re also unclear as to when dana was , as time and space seem to not apply to dana these days . she ' s been without a phone charger for about eight months now , and we ' re still testing . also , i ' m not sure how she ' s been paying her cell phone bill . maureen ? what is that ? maureen , that ' s not a glass of orange juice you ' re drinking , is it ? oh , i see . she got it from our station break room , not from the ralph ' s , so it ' s probably safe then . oh , well , thank you for the offer , maureen , but i ' m ... still working on my coffee . maureen ? is everything ok ? listeners , maureen is just ... staring at me . silent . a single bead of sweat running down her left temple . she is staring now at the orange juice . she is biting her upper lip with her lower jaw , and breathing through her nose . her cheeks are flushing , and she is shaking her head , very ... very slightly . that looks like a ` ` no . '' is that a ` ` no , '' maureen ? listeners , i– i think that ' s a ` ` no '' from maureen . oh ! oh dear ! maureen just flicked . like , she was there , and then she was not , and then she was , like when a plane flies in front of the sun and the light leaves for a brief moment as you wonder – for just that split second – ` ` is this it ? is it over ? '' only to have the sun return as your brain hears the faint hum of a distant jet and you sigh with relief and disappointment that everything is as it was . a similar thing just happened with maureen . listen maureen , i– she is backing out of the studio . she is backing out of the studio . she has dropped the glass . she is flickering . she is flickering ... she is gone . listeners , maureen is gone ! i hear no hum of jets , i– i see no inter , just ... an open door . and an empty glass , and a spreading stain . to the family of inter maureen : she was a good inter , with a beautiful puppy , and a chatty neighbor . she will be missed . wait ugh , i just got another email from carlos , marked urgent . he says : ` ` cecil ? just talked to my team of scientists , who have investigation the house that does not exist – the one in the desert creek housing development that looks like it exists ; like , it ' s right there when you look it and it ' s between two other identical houses , so it would make more sense for it to be there than not – that one . ` ` they still have not gotten up the courage to go inside the house , but they did peek in the window and they saw john peters – you know , the farmer ? – they saw john sitting in a chair in an empty room , staring at a picture on the wall . they could not see what was in the picture , but john was sitting quietly , staring at it , not moving . ` ` they called his name , they tried dealing his phone , but he did not respond . they even knocked on the door ... nothing . ` ` whoever this ‘ john peters ' is , selling oranges and orange juice , is not the john peters we know . ` ` also , i take it back , i think we should go out to eat tonight . i tried to go to the store , but they ' re completely out of pa sta , tomato es , hers , scissors , fire , everything ! '' well , now that is – listeners ? someone is pound ing on the studio door , despite the brightly-lit on air do not disturb sign we always put out . dear listeners , john peters just came to visit ! i should talk with him . maybe this is a good time for us to go to the wea– no ! wait ! stop ! john ? john ? no ! listeners ? ugh ! listeners ! what a fretful few moments we just had ! john peters – you know , the impostor ? – he burst into our studio and tried forcing me to eat an orange . i attempted to reason with him , attempted to talk about our old bowl ing league , and the wood shop class he used to teach , i even asked him about the hilarious times we used to have standing silent and trance-like in front of the ancient chalk spire – predecessor to the current brown stone spire – our mouths fro thing , our minds spinning , our ventricles slowing ... but john did not acknowledge any of these fond memories . as a last resort , with the orange nearing my face and my back pressing hard against the sharp edge of my broadcast table , i grabbed my phone to tell carlos that if i did not make it home tonight , it was not because i did not love him , or did not want to watch a documentary on special scientific graphs , or was too obsessed with my job to relax and enjoy a good meal and some television , it was only because i was tapped out of existence by a lunatic non-john peters . and that , in fact , i do love carlos , and i would want nothing more than to watch a documentary on scientific graphs over some homemade linguini , or to go out to eat again , or whatever ! but then , as i grabbed my phone , i thought , ` ` eh , that ' s way too long to write for a text , '' so ... i just hit john peters upside the head with it , knocking him unconscious . and the sheriff ' s secret police came to carry the fake john away , telling me that i did not see anything here ... but then the strexcorp-affiliated station management arrived , and asked the sheriff and his secret police to stand down , and that they – the secret police – did not see anything here , and to move along like nothing happened . the secret police nodded and quietly shuffled out of the building , heads facing down at their shoes . there ' s still an empty o.j . glass on the floor . the carpet around it is dark – not with liquid stain , but ... with void . the spilled juice has taken the rug wherever it has taken maureen , wherever it has taken the reporter , wherever it probably took the real john peters – you know , the farmer ? oh . my producer , daniel , just gave me a disapproving smile as he handed me this note : ` ` strexcorp synernists inch , majority shareholder of j.p. ' s of , ltd , is recalling all oranges and juices due to ... '' and here there ' s just a dark red smudge across the words . ` ` strexcorp apologizes for any inconvenience , disappearance , lethargy , and/or multiplicity you may have experienced . '' oh , carlos tested . ` ` no pa sta , but there ' s leftover falafel and an unopened bag of nut meg seeds to snack on . xoxo '' and then there ' s an emboli of , uh , two dinosaurs chasing an early-80s ford mustang up a palmetto-lined suburban street as some residents look on , shocked and scared – a few laughing – others undisturbed as they mo w their laws or scalp their fruit-shaped topiary bushes , oh man . oh , that ' s very cut e ! listeners , let me release my own special announcement . cecil palmer would like to not be late for dinner . stay tuned next for an hour that will feel like minutes but will , in actually , take weeks . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single command from a satellite-activated mind control chip .

'' good news , listeners ! the telephone service has finally fixed the telephone booth behind the ta co bell ! the telephone that was always ringing and never had a dial tone ? you know the one . when you picked it up it clicked , and hissed , and sometimes played notes that seemed to come from a music box . you did not recognize the tune , but ... it was familiar , as if from another time and place . since no one uses telephone booths anymore , i ' m not entirely sure why they did this , but the telephone booth is working ! the telephone service dispatched a crew of men who would not be missed . they wore wooden suits , climbed up the nearby pole , and clattered around like so many bamboo wind chimes filled with hamburg . after several hours , they climbed down , furtively smoking cigarettes , and departed in their unmarred black van , removing the out of order sign from the booth shortly before leaving . some say they ' ve seen strangers of varying heights and au ra magnitude speaking into the telephone in a hushed tone , in words that might have been russian , staring at the horizon with cold determination . and as the strangers all departed quickly , all in separate pedicabs , witnesses reported a detached human hand crawling up the inside of the booth . was this lone visitor to the phone booth the young megan allay ? megan was born as a detached hand of an adult man , so ... it seems like this was probably she who slowly , but desperately , picked up the telephone as the sun began to set . we may never know for certain , but at least we know the telephone you ' ll never bother to use is working again . ah ! speaking of telecommunication , listeners , i ' ve been receiving some odd text messages . my phone claims they are from former inter dana , who was trapped in the forbidden dog park several months ago and is now traveling an unknown plane of space and/or time . here are some recent texts from her : found a mountain . mountain ' s not real ? huh ! log those ! dan g it , lighthorse ! sorry , stupid autocorrect . there ' s a lighthorse up on the mountain , and at op the lighthorse a blinking red light . and then no more texts . and it ' s been several days . i tried testing back but my touch screen just displayed a photograph of my face that began to slowly rot , the eyes deepening until they were sunken holes , long white hair growing rapidly , insects crawling from my slackened , decay ed ma w , and then the words ` ` delivered text '' in all caps below it . i decided ... maybe this conversation was one not meant to be . more good news , listeners ! a submarine has arrived from nulogorsk , a tiny fishing village in russia . nulogorsk was a long-time sister city of night vale . we shared pen pal letters and gifts for many years . but , beginning in 1983 , nulogorsk stopped changing the dates on their letters . by 1997 , it became apparent that nulogorsk would never stop existing in 1983. and without being able to openly discuss the complexities of michael jackson ' s career arc , night vale stopped corresponding . so , for this single reason , and no other , the arrival of a nulogorskian submarine in our desert was unexpected . the night vale pta and the management of the local pinkberry released a joint statement , saying ` ` the arrival of the submarine from nulogorsk may represent a renewal of long-ago international hostilities , caused by simple misunderstandings over how to use a calendar properly . '' seeking to allay these concerns , the sheriff ' s secret police ' s tenderness spokesbeing , with the smoothly beautiful features , explained in that voice that calms animals : ` ` decades ago , when you were a child and lived beside the sea , you would go down in the afternoon and stand in the water , warm as blood , and pluck clams from between the rocks . your grandfather would cook them over his stove until they opened , and you would listen to the radio together . the ships would come in the afternoon , piled high with cod and hearing , surrounded by seagulls , carrying tales of adventure and peril in the sloshing boots of every fisherman . ` ` some things do not come back , '' the spokesbeing continued . ` ` they can only travel in one direction , like mountains travel through the centuries . yes , mountains . you were with grandfather when the voice on the radio rose an alarm . grandfather stood up . there was fear upon the monument of his face . this was not supposed to happen . not here . ` ` do you remember the light , so bright you could see it through the wall ? then nothing . then dark , and a ringing telephone . but we are here , and now , and this is not there and then , '' concluded the sheriff ' s spokesbeing . the spokesbeing responded to follow up questions by cocking their head and slowly blinking their milk-glass eyes , like an animal watching an insect crawl across the floor . further inquiries were directed to the ja de statue of a cat who hum s almost inaudibly in the sheriff ' s secret police ' s secret garden . the secret police plan to open the patches of the submarine and look inside at any moment . we ' ll report back as we learn more . listeners , many of you know i have a bit of a delicate relationship with our new station management . and recent events have caused some concern for many of you . but , rest assured , while management and artists are often at odds about how to run a business , here at the station we all have one thing in common : we love radio . i just met our new program director , lauren millard . and you know , she ' s a delight ! in fact , she ' s joining me in the studio right now . i thought it would be a good time to introduce you to the kindest , most gentle manager we have ever had at this station . lauren , it ' s great to have you here ! it ' s great to have you here ! i know change is difficult , both for the talent and for the listeners , but our focus is always on good radio . and , cecil , you are the best at good radio ! aww , thank you . listeners , please know that i really do think things are looking up . i ' m really excited about the new direction we ' re under with lauren ! well , i ca not wait to be more involved . and i just love your show . i ' ve loved every moment of it ! i love your information reports , i love your beautiful voice , i love the way you talk of the town . you clearly love your city , cecil . it shows in your work . i even love your scientist boyfriend . what ' s his name again ? with his perfect hair , and teeth like a military cemetery . he ' s always looking into the scientific mysteries of night vale . he even broke the story , as you reporter might say , of the trans-dimensional oranges our farmers had developed . well , it sure was a good thing he was looking into our oranges , or ... we could have harmed a lot of people on our way to making a ton of money ! so very much money . what ' s a few lives ? so much money ! he ' s a good scientist you have there . what ' s his name again ? ummmmmmm ... ..carlos ? right . that ' s right . carlos . okay . good talking to you ! got ta go . bye ! oh , ugh , okay . well , thank you , lauren ! goodby . and now a public service announcement from the night vale marine geologists association : ` ` the ocean is full of things that would like to kill you . and other things that would ignore or not understand you , and then eventually kill you . because they do not have the same understanding or valuation of life and death as humans . there are still other things that you would probably kill , simply because you think they are beautiful , and you want to possess beautiful things because you believe that beauty and sentence are mutually exclusive . ` ` never go to the ocean . it is a confounding place . it is full of death , and strife , and terror . we ' re marine geologists , and we wo not even go to an ocean , so you know it ' s bad , '' the p sa reads . ` ` maybe just take a nap and think about clouds until they find your body . '' this has been a message from the marine geologists association . the sheriff ' s secret police have opened the hat ch of the submarine from nulogorsk . onlookers describe a curious crack of pressure , as if peeling back the pop top of a can of old soda , and a smell of something regurgitated . wisps of steam were observed to rise from the opened submarine . the sheriff ' s secret police drew their daggers and a junior secret detective was encouraged to volunteer to be the first to explore the vessel . there was silence as she climbed through the hat ch . gentle listeners , the screaming began almost immediately . it was described as a sort of high-pitched shriek that deepened moment by moment , until it was only an agonized moan , then rising back up in pitch again , then falling . onlookers remarked that they had never quite heard a scream like that before – not even that time in the barn . the junior secret detective reappeared after those few narrowing moments , but she was not the woman who went inside the submarine . her hair was long , and gray , and her limbs were withered with age . she tumbled out of the hat ch , and was taken off to the hospital where she is listed in ancient condition , though expected to fully recover . further volunteers discovered the body of an enormous bald-headed man , with some faded flower tattoo , and a left arm that stopped in a rough stump just above his wrist . the sheriff ' s secret police also discovered a postcard , depicting the painted houses and beautiful clear water of nulogorsk . written on the back was a message , in russian : ` ` one adult man . missing hand . and the other items , '' it read , according to google translate . the other items in question included a rotary-dial phone with no receiver cord , a large tin full of hardtack , a wrapped parcel ( which was carried away by a man who was not tall ) , a thick book ( which was carried away by a man who was not short ) , and a front page article from the september 24 th , 1983 issue of the night vale daily journal , written by foreign correspondent leann hart . the headline of this article was : sister city nulogorsk decimated by nuclear attack - no known survivor listeners , this is simply not true ! i had inter see pull up that very issue , and the front page article is by city beat reporter leann hart , and the headline reads : city council ok s book ownership for random selected students which is the truth , listeners ? i can not comprehend what has happened to our old pen pals from nulogorsk ! who were we talking to for all those years ? were they destroyed in 1983 ? i ' m going to get see ' s article to the secret police . the correct historical truth must be validated , and all false histories brutally repressed . and until that time , the only truth we will have is the weather . well , before the sheriff ' s secret police could respond to my news article discrepancy , the unconnected rotary phone on the submarine began ringing . the identified man in the submarine answered the phone , speaking his first words – in russian , of course . he still has yet to be identified , and no one is certain if he is a survivor or a ghost . but he spoke to someone on the other end . ` ` trace the call ! '' an officer shouted to a group of other officers in a nearby van . listeners , they traced the call . and it was coming from the phone booth behind the ta co bell . on the other end of the line was an adult man ' s detached hand named megan , the daughter of ta k and herschel allay . she was alone . all alone – except for the telephone booth , as forgotten technologies have been young megan ' s only friends . this broke the heart of the sheriff ' s secret police . this broke the heart of the two men who had skilled away from the submarine . this broke the heart of the identified man from nulogorsk . and from this moment came wonderful news , listeners . the identified man told the secret police in stiff , but practiced , english , ` ` i am a gift from nulogorsk , in appreciation of night vale ' s many years of friendship and kindness . '' and the identified man offered himself as an organ donor ... or rather , a body donor for night vale ' s very own megan allay . the young girl , born with congenital hand-bodiness , was rushed from the telephone booth behind the ta co bell . the identified man has been rushed from the submarine in the sand wastes . megan has been surgically attached to the wrist stump of the identified man – or , rather , the identified man has been surgically attached to the single hand body of megan allay . megan ' s surgeons have declared the operation a quick and complete success . after emerging from recovery , megan even rose from her bed , her face d our , and took a few toneless steps – like a man balancing the weight of a wet overcoat on a failing hang er – before collapsing onto the floor of her hospital room while nurses screamed and called for help . megan has a long road of therapy ahead of her , learning how to ... everything . but , we believe in her , do not we night vale ? that little girl is going to enjoy the childhood she feels she has missed out on . we wo not mind if she smash es through a few walls , or crush es a few rib cases in hug s . if this is what she wants , we will support her , because she is beautiful . and the identified man from nulogorsk ? sadly , we will never see him again . nor may we ever learn why his truth was so different from our own . but megan ' s truth ... is . she is finally happy . happy in the body she was born without . maybe one day , we will see her : six foot ten , and bald , shambling down the street . we will say , ` ` hello , megan ! '' and maybe , with enough hard work , she will be able to answer back in the singsong voice of a child , ` ` hello , cecil ! '' as she jauntily waves the hand that used to be her entire body . yes , night vale , that sounds just about right . stay tuned next for live coverage of college basketball , as two universities select a dozen students to perform unnatural physical tasks on a wooden entangle inside a cavernous scream chamber . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : you ca not get blood from a turnip . listen ... you need some blood ? i can totally get you some blood . set that turnip down and follow me to the blood . there ' s a lot of blood .
WTNV|Cookies|1 April 2014|this is the officially-released version of cond os , recorded on december 18 , 2013 in brooklyn , new york . if you want the version recorded in san francisco , california on september 25 , 2013 , you want the episode 31.5 transcribe . at last , we are alone . at last we are , all of us , alone together . at last , every human , alone together , on this earth . welcome to night vale . thrilling news , listeners ! it has come to our attention that there will be cond os for sale , right here in night vale . details on them are a little hay – for instance , we do not know what these cond os will look like , where they will be located , who is building them , and what they will cost . but in the official brochure for the development , it does say cond os for sale in a thick , all-caps , black scrawl . one local reactor , speaking under the condition of anonymity , and from within the belly of a grazing deer , said that the cond os are a great investment . ` ` invest your money in cond os , '' said the reactor . ` ` invest your time in cond os . invest your life . invest emotion and hope . invest your ideas about the future , invest your disappointment with your on going ‘ now . ' invest drops of blood . you lose blood all the time on frivolous accidents , now is the chance to imbued it with purpose and ver ve . spill your blood for the cond os ! '' the reactor was then cut off when the deer was spooked by a passing car and ran away . listeners , i do not know much about cond os . i ... do not know much about anything at all , honestly . but i do know this : cond os are coming to night vale . they will be for sale , and this is great and exciting news for us all ! well , it seems that just about half the town of night vale is lined up outside of the con do rental office , which is located in the abandoned gas station on oxford street . everyone is there . janice rio ( from down the street ) , who was practically hopping up and down with excitement over owning a new con do ... whatever a con do is ... whatever it looks like ; leann hart , publishing editor of the night vale daily journal , who was holding a blooded hatchet , in case she came across any baggers or online journalists who might threaten her grip on the printed word ; carlos the scientist . ah h ... ah , carlos the scientist . he was there , wearing a business-casual lab coat , and analyzing those around him with complicated devices he could not explain without eventually just shaking his head and muttering , ` ` ugh , science . '' i do not know if i ' ve ever mentioned this on this show , by the way , um , ... but carlos is totally my boyfriend ! i just did not know if i had brought that up before . hers he ' s very handsome . and into science . and he is learning to be better about calling when he needs to cancel dates to get some experiments done . where was i ? ah , yes . even the dreaded glow cloud was there , hurling dead animals down upon those in line and intending , to all that would listen , the sun will not set again on your lives ! all that you once were now belongs to me ! bury your face into the breast of the earth and worship that which you can not understand ! you know , it makes total sense that the glow cloud would want one of these cond os . i mean , after joining the school board , and sending your kid to the local school , you know , you need to have a nice place at which to raise whatever strange and terrible creature it is that constitutes your family . no one could see into the abandoned gas station , so no one knew what the con do rental office looked like . there was only a bubbling , dark movement , like a pot of boiling squad ink , and the occasional pin point of light , like distant , dying stars . people began to shove each other , trying to catch a glimpse of what the cond os might be . there was shouting . roger singh started to point at every object in his sight – blades of grass , the rust shell of a former gas pump , janice rio ( from down the street ) – asking , ` ` is that a con do ? is that a con do ? '' in a high , cracked voice . and ... all right . i know this is out of nowhere , but ... at what point in a relationship is it normal to think about living together ? is ... let ' s say ... buying a con do a sign that you want to move to that stage ? is that what an action like that might hypothetical be indicating ? oh , yes , also , roger was holding a freshly-severed spine of an unknown animal or possible person , waving it at the bubbling dark window and howling , ` ` give me a con do ! what is a con do ? give me one ! will this buy me a con do ? '' as of press time , no one had told him whether a spinewould buy him a con do . but , do you know what i mean ? like , could this be a sign that he wants to move things in that direction ? you know , i just wish he would communicate more directly sometimes , but ... scientists do not communicate directly . everybody knows that . they communicate using a series of obscure and arcade codes and signals . that is what is meant to be a scientist . roger has started failing at people with the detached spine . ugh , several people have been trampled . it is still not known whether he will be able to buy a con do with the spine . probably not . i ' m sorry , listeners , i ' m going to have to get this . u hm , hello ? cecil ? carlos ? ! ? yes . scientific ally speaking , that is who i am . yeah , i ' ve been meaning to tell you ... you sound different lately.yeah , i– i put in new vocal cords recently . the no – i did not know you went in for surgery ! no no , i ' m a scientist . i put them in myself , easy . it ' s important that a scientist update his or her vocal cords once in a while . otherwise , you know ... throat spiders . oh , no , i knew that . i mean , obviously i knew that . i ' m very into science . but hey , listen , i ' m in the middle of a show ! yeah , i know , you ' re covering the story about the cond os . that ' s why i called . well , i did not know you listened to my show.every time you ' re on ! i– ok , hold on , listeners . i ' ll be right with you . so ... those cond os , right ? they're– they ' re very exciting , right ? everything is exciting , particularly existence ! existence is the most thrilling fact of all ! right . so ... are you doing ok ? um , i ' m getting reports that it ' s even more fatal outside than usual . by 19 standard fatality units , i know . i have a danger met er in front of me . listen , cecil , i called to talk to you about something important , but i– now i do not think i have time . but time ... ... is not real , i know . neither is anything else . that is the most scientific fact of all , but they ' re calling my name and i do not want to lose my place in line . this is important , uh , because ... mmm . i have to go , i ' m sorry . i ' ll call you back later , probably . everything is some level of ‘ probably , ' nothing is a promise , it is most likely we ' ll survive to talk again . no i understand , i lov–hey , listen , i love oh , um , uh , sorry , no no no , you go ! th – they they ' re calling my name , i have to – i ... ha – i ' ll call back when i can . goodby . oh , um . ok . um ... goodby . uh , i ' m sorry , listeners . um , yeah , where was i ? um ... let ' s talk about your health for a moment . let ' s concentrate on your health . let ' s think about your health . do you feel healthy ? pay close attention to your body and see if you feel as healthy as you thought . oh ! was that a slight tinge in the muscle of your arm ? that is a bad sign ! that ' s a symptom of all sorts of diseases . was that a slight snaffle as you breathed in ? sure , it could just be allergies , or a mild cold ... but it also could be the start of tuberculosis . does tuberculosis even start with a snaffle ? you do not know ! and so it might very well . listen to your heart beating . hear your heart beat . feel it . feel the one thing keeping you alive . feel your heart beat . are you healthy ? are you healthy ? this has been a public health announcement by the greater night vale medical community . their lines are open for appointments now . please have a credit card ready . ladies and gentlemen , the cond os are here ! they arrived , silently , in the night . they are thoroughly modern in their design . they are so modern , it is postulated they might actually be from a few centuries in the future , which is the most modern a thing can be . the cond os are featureless black cub es . they are standing , perfect , dark forms , where the ramshackle homes and dust-worn strip malls of night vale once stood . and there are so many of them ! they are a majestic cityscape . they are a nightmare . and they are beautiful . carlos has hauled out his science equipment ( of course ) , and is testing the cub es . the cub es emit a low level of radiation , and some sort of strange , pulling energy . the energy would be difficult to describe in scientific terms but , if he had to give it language , he would probably use the scientific terms ` ` pulling '' and ` ` strange . '' the cub es do not appear to have any entrance , or windows ... so they are similar to many of the old tract homes that were built around here in the 1950s . but , they also do not appear to have any roof or foundation , or yard , or terrace , or ratio , or any other vestige of a home . they only have their sleek lines , their contour , their corners , the sheerness of their featureless walls . we do not yet know if these cond os mean us harm , or well . we only know of their presence , and so , let us know that . let us all hold on to that knowledge . the cond os , black cub es of enormous size , are here ... and we know it . and now—cecil ? cecil ? um , listeners , there is a voice , but i can see no one in my studio . it is a familiar voice , and also my coffee cup appears to be three inches to the left of where it wait ' s me , the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . also , i put your coffee cup where it was supposed to be . for reasons of fate . ah h , i see . um , well , while i have you here it is terrible what the cond os will do to you . not ‘ to you ' as in ‘ you , ' but ‘ to you ' as in ‘ all of us . ' but , not to me . nothing ever really happens to me . i am completely safe from harm , and this is a great burden . oh , while you were out this morning , i made your dining room table half a foot shorter . i thought it looked better that way . i hope you like it , it took me an hour with a jackdaw and a level . well , i ' m sure that lower meals means ... faster digestion ! um , or not sure , but i ' m saying it . and in saying it , i am instantly believing it , and then i ' m going from believing it to being violently certain about it , against all evidence to the contrary.thanks , that means a lot . not ‘ to me , ' but your words hold a lot of meaning intrinsically . almost everything we say does . if you looked at any word in the english language close enough , you would see within the great , glowing coils of the universe unwinding . right ! our language holds the key to it – the key to the unravelling of all things . i think that one day , this world will simply talk itself to death , and i will be left to f lit about in the void . i will be the careless old woman who secretly lives nowhere . now , you mentioned the cond os . let me ask you , what do you think it means when carlos says he ' s looking at cond os ? i mean , did he mean that he wanted us both to look at cond os together ? or was he communicating independence , like , ` ` you stay here , i ' m going off to look at cond os alone . ` ` ` ` beware the cond os , cecil . '' i mean , do you think he ' s looking to just buy one for himself ? is that what you ' re saying ? ` ` beware the unravelling of all things . '' or is he looking for a shared con do ? ... hello ? hello ? well , i can no longer see a fleeting image of someone just over my shoulder , no flicked of movement from the corner of my eye , so i guess she ' s gone . also , there are three slow walking gray reaches climbing out of my coffee cup . and also , i am out of coffee . and now , traffic . picture a car . no , you are doing it wrong . try again . picture a car . ... really ? that ' s what you picture when you picture a car ? all right , look ... we ' ll go with that . i ' m not happy about it , but we ' ll go with your idea of a car for now . so . picture that car . and now , picture a road . are you picturing it ? close your eyes if you have to . if you need to , gently remove your eyes and slip them into your bag . do you see the car driving on the road ? good . now , picture a destination . any destination you want . no , that was incorrect . the correct destination was a clear and placid lake . so , all of you , out there , picture the car . picture the road . picture the clear and placid lake . and what i want you to do now is put the car in the lake . it ' s very simple . just imagine the car leaving the road , and now entering the lake . leaving the road , entering the lake . great . are we all picturing the car in the lake ? ok . city council is notifying me that the test went perfectly , and that we all successfully murdered a lone driver using the collective willpower of our minds . wo w ! wo w ! the human mind is a powerful thing ! this has been traffic . reports are in that the first con do buyers nervously approached their acquisition , those black cub es , giant , where once stood other places . the buyers edged toward them . they reached out their hands , trembling . they touched the smooth , cold walls of the cub es , and they saw . they saw . janice rio ( from down the street ) saw a city . a lost city . a dead city , nest led in a jungle – the kind of jungle that only ever existed in books written by people who have never seen a jungle . the city stood , and janice stood , in perfect dread , its doors were open jaws . its windows were open jaws . its roads and avenues were gaping mouths and open jaws . that dead city entered . it rotted in its jungle tomb , but ... it was not empty . and she started to run . run through the thick foliage of that absurd place , she shouted and ran . and then her hand slipped away from the con do , and it was all gone . and she fell to her knees weeping , as though she had lost something , although of course , she d never had anything at all . roger singh ( who had been able to buy a con do with the spine ) saw a cave , underwater , in an ocean far to the north . and the water around him was dark – so dark ! – that he was not sure even which way led to the surface , to life ... and which way led down only to the deep silent . he gasped , but found he had no breath ... and no need to breathe . and there was this cave that shouldered with a light , a light that was charged and alive . and shadows moved against the light , cast by ... what ? ... within the cave . and then he swam towards it , uncertain whether he was guest , or sacrifice , or invulnerable dreamer . and he heard a song from the cave , and he knew it , and it was perfect . and he sang along , but at the same time , he had never heard that song before in his life . and what was life ? what made it his ? it all seemed so small , part of the world that did not exist anymore . and then he went backwards from the face of the con do , and the ocean and the cave vanished , and he stared up at the blue sky , as wash with light as the water around him had been dark . ` ` was that a con do ? '' he asked . ` ` was that what one is ? '' another , samantha guzman , only screamed — her eyes bulging wider and wider , her hand clamped to the surface of the cub e . so ... it seems that move-in day is going pretty well so far ! today ' s show is brought to you by the generous support of the following sponsors : the sun all other sun s with their own planets and own possibilities a trail , winding its way into a thick wood the gesture this bit of melody : a & w root beer the slow disintegration of your body light , in every form : visible , invisible , deadly , hidden please help our show by supporting these sponsors , using ch ants and simple offerings . and now , more on the con do story ‘ scuse me , uh , cecil . oh , yes , excuse me ? sorry to interrupt , but–cease speaking and turn your amusingly shaped ears to heed my booming and impressive voice ! yeah , thank you , green head . uh , hey , listeners ! hiram mcdaniels , here . mayor al candidate , noted five-headed dragon , and completely innocent of any trumped-up insurance fraud charges . hello , hiram . uh , it ' s great to have you live in the studio , and also you , and you , and you , and you.great , yeah . we could not help but notice that you had the , uh , careless old woman on just a bit ago , and uh , that hardly seems fair.candidates must be given equal time on community radio . says that in section 12 , clause 3 of the fairness code we are all born with imprint ed on our hearts . my apologies , you are perfectly right . that was my failing as a community radio host , but it ' s just ... hey , listen , i ' m just a little distracted . um , oh ! can i ask you sort of um ... a relationship question ? no , you barely-sentient sack of flesh and fluid ! sorry , there , cecil bud dy , but we just do not have the time right now . anyway , if it ' s ok with you , i d like to exercise my right as mayor al candidate by talking about the important subject of my favorite memory.now , my favorite memory was when i was just 30 years old . hardly half as big as i am now.we were 43 % of our current stature , give or take a decimal.give it or take it , blue head , give it or take it ! it ' s your natural right ! thank you , purple heads , there i was , standing on a city street . and not this city , i had not heard of night vale yet . i asked a man walking by on the street where a good place to eat was . you know what he said ? i ... know very little.he bowled in fear and scrambled to the fragile shelter of the nearest building ! i roared ! filled with shame at the effect my form had on these judging insects ! it was a real bummer.we cried , and – and we cried and we were still hungry , and we cried . well , that ' s a ... nice favorite memory ! oh , no , no , no , no , that was not my favorite memory , that was just , uh ... what do you call it ? uh ... context ! yeah , context . thanks , green . now , my favorite memory was when i was standing in a city – this city . i was standing in night vale . i had heard of it by then.whispers ! rumors ! flying through the night on hot drafts , with vague directions in my mind and nothing but miles of mad darkness all around me ! uh , right , this place was real hard to find . so i was standing on the street , and i ... i asked a man walking by where a good place to eat was . you know what he said ? no pe , again , knowledge very limited here.he said , well ... he did not say anything.right , gray head , he did not say anything ! he just opened his mouth wider than a human is physically capable of doing , let out a loud hoot , pointed at the moonlight all-nite din er . he just went about his day . no screaming ' , no fear.it was very disappointing ! no , green , it was magical ! finally , a place where what i looked like did not matter ! it did not matter that i have trouble controlling my fire-breathing , or that the din er looked a bit far , and so i just ate the man instead . none of that mattered . because i had found my home.we had found our home.yeah . exactly , yes . that is why i want to be mayor . mayor of the first city that ever made me feel normal . night vale . as my campaign slogan says , i am literally a five-headed dragon . who cares ! i tell you , many many people care , and all over the world . but no one here ! that ' s all that matters to me.and me ! and me.and me.and me ! thank you , listeners . thank you , cecil . no , thank you , hiram . um , that was a very nice story . even if i did my very best to learn nothing from it.goodbye , bite-sized creature ! goodby ! wo w ! man , what a striking and charismatic dragon . mm , mm-mm-mm . where was i ? ah , yes . more now , on the con do story . those people who have been given terrible visions by the cond os are saying that they feel they must go back – go back to their con do . that something felt unfinished about what they saw . that even as they feel terrified , they must go back to see what it is will happen next . the sheriff ' s secret police are attempting to stop the con do owners by sending passive-aggressive messages via helicopter-borne loudspeaker . ` ` sure , '' they are saying . ` ` go ahead . touch the cub e again . i guess . i mean , if you do not care about your community , and your fellow citizens , then i guess you probably should . we wo not miss you anyway ! like , no big deal . touch the cub e if you want ! '' and they are . roger , samantha , janice rio ( from down the street ) – they are touching the great black walls of the con do cub es , and the walls are rippling and bubbling as though liquid , like a pot of boiling squad ink , with darting lights , like distant dying stars . the hands of the people are pushing through into the space within , whatever that space is , and they are – one by one , and with varying degrees of hesitancy – entering their cond os . bystanders say that once inside , the human forms are going limp , and floating up into the center of the cub es , where they stay , paralyzed . faces , slack . eyes , glazed . a small sign has appeared outside of each cub e that contains a person . the sign is red , and says in simple white letter ing : cond os : a perfect kind of human a perfect kind of life get yours today ! listeners , i can not advise getting yours today . not until we understand fully what these cond os are . and , given our track record , we will likely never fully understand what they are . so it ' s best just to stay away . more on this as it develops . but first , a look at the community calendar . this friday , the staff of dark owl records will be holding a clearance sale . ` ` everything must go ! '' they will declare on a bright banner with a thick font . ` ` music is old ! it ' s ancient ! it can not tell the stories of our lives , our souls , our societies any longer ! '' the banner will read . ` ` it can not mean anything ! it can not give you what you need ! buy this music , and eat this music ! , '' the banner will say in bright yellows and blue . ` ` tear it into plastic shares and swallow it ! it knows not what it has wrought on our world ! '' the banner will exclaim to excited music lovers . ` ` let it shred you from within as we laugh from without ! '' the banner will announce . ` ` 40 % off all cds , 70 % off all posters ! friday only ! '' saturday afternoon is the opening of the new kid ' s learning wing at the museum of forbidden technologies . well , this wing has been built , but no one is certain where . the museum staff says that they kid s interested in learning all about forbidden technologies , as well as those kid s who are uninterested ... well , in fact , all children , the museum says , will eventually be chosen during sleep . they will wake up late one night in this new wing , experiencing all the magic and wonder of learning . sunday morning , the night vale pta will be holding a ruffle . tickets are only $ 2 each , and the winner ( as usual ) will never be heard from again . monday has been rescheduled to wednesday , and wednesday has been doubled . tuesday ... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho , man . ugh , you do not even want to know . or , you do want to know , but the powers that be do not even want you to know , so you can all just be properly surprised . this has been the community calendar . hello ? hello , cecil . are you there ? carlos ? hi . u mm , i ' m on the air . um , i ' m still doing the show.right , no , i know , it ' s just ... i got a con do . a con do for us . i was thinking that maybe we could wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ... for us ? that we could—but it was not what i thought it would be . it ' s a giant black cub e , featureless , where the vacant lot behind the ralph ' s used to be . i touched it , and i saw ... i saw endless rows of erlenmeyer flasks , and every one held a liquid , and all of the liquid were bubbling , and before each one was a notebook of numbers , and above was a dial with more numbers . i saw all of this , and i understood you touched the con do ? do not ! do not touch the con do ! do not touch it again ! you know what ? hold on , i ' ll be right there ! i need to get to those flasks . each liquid was bubbling . there were numbers . i ' m going into the con do . the con do is perfect . it is perfect , and i understand . carlos , no ! do not go in there ! carlos ! carlos ! hello ? i ' m sorry , ladies and gentlemen , um , i have — listen , i ' ll be back really soon . i ' ll be back as soon as i can . but before i go , let me take you now to the weather . hello again , listeners . cecil is still gone . i guess it ' s just you and me now . you have no idea how often it is just you and me . i ' ve learned this new thing where i can silently skitter along your ceiling . it ' s an interesting perspective . i d show you , but ... you ca not see me . and anyway , i think maybe it would upset you to see a careless old woman glittering along your ceiling . there always seems to be something upsetting you . you should relax more . it ' s not that there ' s nothing coming to get you , there ' s everything coming to get you ... but relax anyway , just on principle . lie down and look up at the ceiling – a ceiling on which you can see nothing glittering , even though there is something glittering , there are so many glittering creatures on your ceiling , but forget that . lie down , and look up at the ceiling and breathe with those curiously fragile lungs of yours and remind yourself : do not worry . do not worry . all is as it was meant to be . it was meant to be lonely and terrifying and unfair and fleeting . do not worry . let me tell you a story . once upon a time there was a young woman who had a face , and did not live in secret . she had a home of her own , and she always thought her life had some great purpose . ` ` this is not my life as it should be , '' she said , indicating her life as it was . ` ` my life is different from this . this is not it at all ! '' and so , she sought out changes in her life . she changed careers , and romantic relationships , she changed houses and hair colors and still , her life was not what she was sure it should be . she changed more ; she became more secretive . she watched how other people lived . maybe one of them have a life that should belong to her . soon , there was less and less of her . she was not living her own life , and so she was not living any life . it was harder and harder for people to see her , because there was less and less of her to see . and then she died . oh , that was not me . i see the confusion here . no , that was a young woman i watched as i secretly lived in her home . i– i just found her story interesting , as i find so many stories interesting . cecil should be back soon . i know you are hoping he is safe , and that the scientist is safe . i know . i ' m watching them right now , even as i speak to you . but i wo not tell you what ' s happening . that is because i ' m also slightly malicious . sorry about that . i should go now . i do not mean ‘ go , ' i am always with you . but i am going to stop talking now , let you forget about me . let you find some reason to dismiss that movement in the corner of your eye . after all , it ' s probably nothing . it ' s probably nothing , after all . look , i'm— i ' m sorry , listeners , i ' m back . i ' m really sorry for ... by the time i got there , carlos was floating in the cub e , and there was that sign , ` ` a perfect kind of human , a perfect kind of life . '' well ... i did not hesitate , i jumped into that black cub e after him , and instantly i saw . i saw great distances . i saw ... ugh . jagged mountains . i saw a dark planet lit by no sun . i saw shrouded figures standing on a beach in a circle , gently swaying into each other against the backdrop of a roiling , bottomless ocean . i saw all of this , and i understood ! i understood that the cub es are perfect ! i understood that this is how we become perfect . i understood that what i was seeing was the way to perfection . and i do not know how i understood this . thinking about it now , nothing about it seems good , let alone perfect . but inside the cub e , within its chambers , it all makes sense . and i understood . and there was a moment . there was a moment , dear listeners , where i considered it . i considered joining carlos and becoming perfect . but i ' ve come to know something after these months together with dear carlos . perfection is not real . perfection is not human . and carlos is not perfect , no . even better — he is imperfect . everything about him , and us , and all of this , is ... it ' s imperfect ! and those imperfections in our reality are the seams and the cracks into which our out-sized love can see p and pool . and sometimes we are annoyed , and disappointed , and that too is a part of how love works . it is not a perfect system , but ... oh , well . and so i resisted . i fought off the vision of the shrouded figures and the dark planet and all that was perfect and i held close to perfection . to my perfection . and to my imperfect carlos . and i took him , and i carried him out of the cub e . and we came up , heaving , into this world that will disappoint us . finally , free . and he said , ` ` well , '' actually , i– i recorded the whole conversation . of course . because i ' m never without my microphone . he said , cecil ? i was thinking about the series of on going actions that we perceive as the present , and the amass ing of memories that we treat as the living record of the past and the hopes and dreams and assumptions that we project as the future . i was thinking about time . and about how it means something to so many people , and about how it ' s so finite , and also so infinite . i was also thinking about space . about how it is nothing , and then , a point which is just a single spot within the nothing , and a line which separates the nothing into two nothing , and how a plane is a patch of nothing and an angle just where two nothing meet , but all those things combined , with an object of points , lines , planes , and angles , an object with length and width and depth that can take up actual space . until that object becomes something made of nothing – within nothing . an object can be a wall , a floor , a roof , a bed , a table , a dog , a door , a rug , a ... a home . and then , i thought about how a home is just a group of objects connected by a shared personal experience of time – our past , our present , our assumed future . a home is ... i mean , uh , scientific ally speaking , speaking form the point of view of mere facts and logic , and um ... hm m . you know , what with science , and all ... uhhh , i– i– i just thought it was ... time for us to ... make a home together . and i said ` ` yes ! yes ! that would be , well , that would be neat !

WTNV|WALK|15 February 2014|at a loss for words ? here ' s a few you can use : welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . we have some news that will affect your morning com mute , so let ' s dive right into it . walk signals across the whole of night vale are malfunctioning . of course , usually they show either a graphics photo of a uncover pedestrian , indicating you should wait , or time-lapse photography of flowers wilt ing , indicating that it is safe to cross . but this morning , computers all over night vale are reporting that , baffling , they now all have just the word ` ` walk '' in bold , white letters . citizens are standing by the side of the road , un sure of whether they are allowed cecil ! cecil , it ' s dana ! oh , it ' s so good to be able to communicate again ! cecil ? where d he go ? *sigh* i do not think he can hear me , but ... i ' ll keep talking just in case . cecil ? i have been in this desert for months now . years , maybe . get enough minutes and you have days , have months , have years , have the whole of your life . there ' s never a great shift , only a gradual sliding downwards . i can see the blinking light up on the mountain . i looked into it , and my head went one way while my mind went another . a lunch outside of all that seems to be . i moved my head just a touch to the left , a glance in a world of perspective , and i was here , in your studio ! well , not here-here . i do not know how it happened , or how long this vision in which we all pretend to be real will last . i am pretending as hard as i can . when i first got here , being a good mountain believer , i turned my back to it and marched directly into the flat desert . and soon enough , i had somehow come back to the mountain . i turned and marched away again , but ended up right back here . there ' s a blinking light up on the mountain , and i blink in and out of its vicinity against my will . occasionally , i see huge , masked figures , warlike , towering , but also distant and listless . they have not seen me . or , if they ' ve seen me , they have not cared . or , if they ' ve cared , they have not done anything with that feeling . i ' m not scared of them . there are so many things in this world to be scared of . why add to that number when the only cause is you know nothing about them and they are huge ? it would make no sense . i found a door out in the desert , but it was chained shut on the other side . from behind it , i thought i smelled that particular night vale smell – the smell of home , like sour peaches and linen . like freshly-cut wood and burnt almonds . i knocked and knocked , hoping someone from back there would hear it and let me through , but it never opened . i was not even sure which side was supposed to open . i knocked on both sides , but ... nothing . i kept walking and found myself back at the mountain . there is a blinking light up on the mountain . and so there is nothing else for it . it is time for me to climb . the face of the mountain is steep , and lined with sharp ridges and crumbling l edges . this will not be easy . i wonder if anything ever will be ? hopefully i will know something when i am up there that i did not know when i was down here . elevation must equal knowledge . it must ! because nothing else has . cecil , i will keep trying . i do not have to keep trying , there is no obligation for me to not just give up , just slump down until i fall away and join the in animate matter of this strange other world . i do not have to keep trying . remember that , i say to myself , as i keep trying . i do not know if you ' ve heard any of this . i d like to think you did . i d like to think that i ' m home . i d like to think that mountains are not real , even though i know now , without doubt , that they are . i will see you again , perhaps . from up there , wherever that is . just me , always me , but from higher up . goodby , cecil . unable to stop walking . walk , the signals say . and the pedestrians walk . in unison . arms swinging in a rigid rhythm . this is the worst malfunctioning of walk signals night vale has seen since the time all their light bulb were accidentally replaced with poison gas dispensers . more on this story as it loom s closer to us . and now , a word from our sponsors . a bolding grassland beneath a low cliff side . there is a monk . picture what a monk looks like . a bell rings . from his hand , maybe . then he takes a small step . then there ' s that bell again . it will take him a long time to make it from this bit of grass to whatever there is beyond it . an entire lifetime it will take him . and even then , he will die unfinished . undone in midst of doing , having gone slowly to nowhere much . then a bell will ring . from his hand , maybe . or from somewhere else . and then , nothing . mountain dew . do the dew . and now , back to ou – hello , cecil ? cecil , can you hear me ? admit . cecil , it is beautiful here . it is empty here . i found a lighthorse up on the mountain . tall , maybe 40 feet ? built of brown stone and about 15 feet in diameter . beyond the lighthorse , i found a settlement of sort . it was bound inside the stone walls of a tightly-wound gorge . i hope to find answers in this settlement . i hope to find anything . here is what i found : dust , mostly . emptiness . a sense of loss as i thought about the distance between myself and those i love . an interesting rock , but i ca not find it anymore . i miss my brother . a sense of loss as i thought about the people who never returned home to the settlement . if they no longer exist to feel loss , then i shall feel it for them . also , there were strange drawings along the walls of the gorge . orange triangles growing bigger and bigger as i traced my way deeper into the spiral . there was a soft light just around the edges of the triangles . when i looked at them , i felt a light in my head and it pound ed like a migrate against the back of my eyes . i could not look at them . i could not look away . i was lost in the spiral . it was built by good people , but they were gone , taken by something larger and stronger than them . much larger and stronger than even the masked warriors i saw before . i worried about what who would be taken next . my eyes hurt . so through my subjectivity , the entire world hurt . and then , a bright slackness , from somewhere beyond the spiral . that was when i realized i had forgotten that there was anything outside of the spiral . it had become the entirety , the totality , all of that . but i followed the bright slackness , a near-blinding beam of pure darkness , and it led me back out again . the orange triangles grew smaller and smaller , until they were little dots of freckled rock face . there is something coming , cecil . i feel it in the air . it – it ' s like a hot wind blowing ? but not hot , deathly cold . and not a wind , a vast creature . and not blowing , rushing at us out of the gaps in time and memory with which we hold together our lives . when i look to the horizon , i see light . like the light in the spiral . i feel it push against the back of my eyes . it is the unravelling of all things , the great , glowing coils of the universe unwinding . i wish i could tell you more . communication is difficult . it is impossible , some say , communicating the idea of its impossibility to others . i feel myself slipping . i ' m getting fainter now . or ... no . no . you are ! which i have not done , by the way , in years ! or , at least , days . or at least , i ' m not doing it right now ! thursday is a lost cause , but we will keep on fighting . we will get up , say ` ` yes ! today is a different day than before ! '' believing this against all evidence , eating food like that matters . going to jobs that mean the same thing as they did before , but cast in a new light by our own optimism , which will slowly drain away until all that is left is the movements and thoughts we ' ve had before . echoes of ourselves , under lined to emphasize the lack of emphasis . coming home , drifting home . aimless homeward wandering into a kitchen that is too small for our needs , and eating food that is not what we imagined it would be . and watching television that means more to us than our jobs . and , finally , falling asleep – in which we dream of the thursday that could be ... if only we lived thursday to the full potential of its thursday-ness , not expecting it to be anything but thursday , embracing every inch of its thursday reality , and living each thursday moment anew , only to wake the next thursday , and again impose , un successfully , our imagined thursday onto the unyielding frame of thursday . our thursday . a lost cause . this has been the community calendar . the crowd amass ed by the walk signals is now marching down route 800 , apparently advancing on city hall . when reached for comment , the city council said that they were definitely at city hall , ready to receive the concerns of their constituents , and not , say , hiding in a hastily-dug hole in mission grove park , keeping as still as possible , and breathing through their dirt g ills until this all blows over . ` ` incidentally , '' their comment continued , ` ` if you happen to see a conspicuous pile of earth in any park s , maybe just ... throw some leaves on it , or put a bench over it , to make it less obvious . no biggie , just if you get a chance , that d be cool , '' the council concluded , their voices noticeably muffled . fortunately , the effect of the walk signals only reaches those who are looking at one , and i myself ... hey , what how did that get in here ? u mm , listeners , there is a walk signal in my studio . ` ` walk , '' it says . i must walk . the signal is saying so . i will have to leave my desk in order to do that . and so , before i go , i take you to the walk-ther ... the weather . the walk . walk . walk . we i ca not seem to get hold of cecil . i ' m trying to tell him something important , but just as i showed up here again , he announced the weather . the weather is beautiful here . cecil could not hear me , and i do not remember what i wanted to say . i remember the table at my grandfather ' s house . it had carved legs in the shape of a myriads of animals , spiral ing around each other , whole ecosystems within each leg . but it was also well-used . we ate there , we talked there , we lived around it , in rows and columns delineated by chairs and space . i remember diagonal of sunlight in the late afternoon , drawn across its flat expanse , transverse by my grandfather ' s hand as he swept it through whatever story he was telling , to highlight the words with motion , to motion us closer to the words . i remember my mother , as rapt as i was . i remember my brother , as rapt as i was . i remember that i have not seen my mother or my brother for months now . and in some ways , i miss that table more than i miss them . we are , all of us , only one life each . but that table is all of our lives added together , a delicate , tangled problem we never wished to solve . but , life solve s all our problems against our will . i remember , i am dana . or , i am dana ' s double . one of us killed the other with the staple r . even i do not know which one . i have these memories , but memories prove nothing . experiences also prove nothing . there are many proofs for nothing . it is the concept of which we are most certain . i ' m sorry . i ' m trying to remember something important , and i am failing . my grandfather died a long time ago . a few months ago , i killed my double . these facts have no symmetry . they are disconnected . i must find a way back to you , listeners . i must protect night vale , and cecil , and my mother , and my brother , and whoever i am , i must protect them from what is coming : the unravelling of all things ! this winding gorge spiral around itself . an empty ecosystem within the mountain . beyond it , the desert is a flat expanse , with diagonal of sunlight transverse by my passing . i am sweeping through my own story , highlight ing the words with motion . mentioning us closer to the end . this is not what i wanted to tell you . listeners , look past the things you think you see . move your head just a touch to the left , a glance in a world of perspective , and then ... you might see it : an entire universe in the corner of your eye . i have seen this lighthorse with its red beam rotating out into the desert distance . i have seen the dog park , and its infinite , bland secrets . i have seen the settlement in the gorge , and i do not wish to see it again . i have seen cecil . but i have not seen my mother . i have not seen my brother . life solve s the problems we hope it wo not . you may hear from me again . i ' m afraid ... no , concerned . no , afraid , that you will not . i wish i could stay , but the noise of the approaching ... ugh , whatever it is , has gotten louder . closer . i must go . this is inter dana . sister , daughter , or not . dana ? with a question mark . this is me , or my double , signing out . i miss you , night vale . goodby . and so , we are all saved again ! i ' ll be honest , night vale , that was the most worried i ' ve been in some time . and how we were saved was so unlikely and miraculous , that i feel that today will become one of the standard tales told every year on frightening day . certainly , it is a story i will never forget . here is where i leave you . not to walk away ... i think i will avoid walking for a while . but certainly to go somewhere , to see someone . and i do not know ... if he suggests a walk , i might change my mind . he can be as persuasion as hypnotics malfunctioning city equipment sometimes , as the old saying goes . stay tuned next for the noise of my hurried retreat , echoing first as sound , and then as memory . and maybe , then again , as part of tonight ' s fractured dreaming . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : please move your brain so we can get to the drugs . and stop leaving it there . we ' ve talked about this .
WTNV|Numbers|1 March 2014|i sing the body electric . i gasp the body organic . i miss the body remembered . welcome to night vale . even as much of town has been in flux , listeners , there is also much that has remained solid . it ' s hot here , for instance . it ' s a desert . there are still lights in the sky above the arby ' s , and we still understand them . the sun is still rising – and setting – loudly ... on most days . but , nearest and dearest to my heart , among all the constant in life , is wzzz , our local numbers station , broadcast ing from that strange and tall antenna built out back of the abandoned gas station on oxford street . it still broadcast a monotony female voice reading out seemingly random numbers , interspersed with chimes , 24 hours a day , seven days a week . no transfer in ownership of most of the town , nor unrest in the streets , nor declared war by a tiny civilization under a bowl ing alley could change how it operates . until , well ... until today . it changed . here , listen . twenty-three . ninety-two . thirty-three . sixty-seven . eighty-eight . forty-one . forty-one . forty ... i ... i ... at which point the broadcast ceased . it has been silent since . what does this mean ? where did the numbers go ? we reached out to the management of wzzz for comment , but then realized we still have no idea who manages it . so we reached out in general , directing questions out into the still of today – at suspicious birds , at passers-by checking their phone , at ourselves , hunched over breakfasts that , every time , we swear will be early and leisurely , but always end up late and meager . no one has provided any comment . we will continue to monitor the situation . as her term approaches its end , mayor pamela mitchell has taken to calling emergency press conferences as much as five times a day , up from the usual one or two . her most recent one involved her showing attending reporter slid es of renaissance-era portraits while explaining , ` ` health is very important . remember exercise . think back on times that you ' ve moved , or expended energy . also remember eating . recall food , and what it was like . remember sleep . reminisce about rest . drink plenty of water , but leave some water in case of fire . '' she then plumped onto the rough-hewn speaker ' s podium . ` ` i ' m going to miss this , '' she whispered , not speaking at anyone in particular . ` ` i ' m just ... going to miss this . '' she ended the conference by popping hundreds of orange balloons , methodically , and with her back turned to the audience . but , despite this big finish , onlookers commented that her heart no longer seemed to be in such showy political stunts . what is next for our beloved mayor , who is stepping down in just three months ' time ? what is next for any of us ? death , presumably . with some stuff before that . i look forward to it ! and now , a word from our sponsor . today ' s sponsor is hulu.com . hull . let ' s talk about watching things . let ' s talk about watching , rather than actually watching . let ' s think about talking about watching a second-hand experience . let ' s continually abstract ourselves from what we believe is the world . hull . the pulling life of your body is an undeniable fact ! but deny it anyway . looking for the answers to all of life ' s problems ? we recommend obstinate denial . accept no substitute . accept nothing . hull . water circles the drain of our planet , always coming back for one more go to see if , this cycle , it will be different . it will not be different . the sky will break open , and water will fall , one more time . one more time . hull . the terror you feel in quiet moments is not misplaced , just mistimed . hull . huuluu . huuuluuu . huuuuluuuu . huuuuuluuuuu huuuuuuluuuuuu . huuuuuuuluuuuuuu . huuuuuuuuluuuuuuuu . huuuuuuuuuluuuuuuuuu ! hulu.com ! sign up now , and get the latest episode of ! an update on our earlier story : local numbers station wzzz has resumed its transmission , although the format is a little ... u mm ... different than before . take a listen : tree-lined hills , and blue skies . or no . that ' s click . a bird in flight ! ooh , even worse ! when we talk about freedom , we restrict ourselves to so few images . images of freedom should be as liberating as the feeling itself ! i want to talk about freedom as a drum set being thrown down a hill , as opening a book one night , and water gushing from the pages until my life is a lake and i swim away . or as a bird in flight ! with all the dependence on physics , and exhaustion , and food supply , and merciless gravity that the actually implies . i just do not want to talk about freedom in terms of numbers . anything but that ! i ' m so tired of numbers ! i ' m so tired . we do not know what this means , or why it is happening , i could say , referring to anything in the world , although in this case i am referring specifically to the broadcast from our friendly local numbers station , which has recently so radically changed its format . more on this , as we develop understanding . oh ! i almost forgot to mention : i got another email from our former inter , dana . she ' s doing her best to keep away from the mountain and the blinking light up on it . of course , she keeps finding herself coming back to it anyway . but , like anyone who grew up in night vale , dana has been told over and over again what to do if you find yourself in a geographical loop , continually returning to the same place , no matter which direction you run screaming . the first step is to stop running , and stop screaming . doing that rarely helps . children are also taught this simple memory device so we can remember when running and screaming is useful . the memory device goes like this : knife . the second step is to stop trying to move away from the focus of the geographical loop . much of your life is already taken up in futile action , why add one more ? instead , keep the object on your horizon , and walk diagonal to the right or left of it . this will result in you keeping a wide , even circle around the center of the loop – or vector h , as we all remember singing as toddlers – and this will give you time to consider your situation . dana has followed these steps admirably , and says that the mountain has been off to the left of her for weeks now . she also says that sometimes , when she turns her head , she finds herself in night vale , but that no one can seem to see or hear her . it ' s possible she ' s in the room with me right now . if so , hello , dana ! if not , hello retracted . one should never leave a hello received . dana says that the great masked figures , warlike , sulking , but despondent , have been coming closer and closer . she says she is not afraid . she says this five different times throughout the email , seemingly unaware of her repetition . i think , listeners , that she is afraid . she says that soon she will approach and talk to one . dana , be careful ! ... i think to myself , unable to answer my email . oh , unless she is here , watching me unseen . in which case : dana ! oh , dana ! be careful ! an update on our local numbers station , wzzz : ah ... uhhh ... i ' m not sure if ` ` numbers station '' is the right term anymore . the broadcast has been changing so radically throughout the day . right now , for instance , it ' s ... well , maybe it ' s better if you just heard : tiiiiger ! fiiiighter ! dancing through the fiiiire and ii iii am the chaaaampion ! and you ' re go n na hear me roooarrrrr ! louder than the liiiiion ! ‘ cause iii am – we do not know if this is part of a nefarious plan , if there is a plan at all ( nefarious or otherwise ) , who would have planned it , and what they were planning for . we do know that plans are faulty at best , and delusion at most . so maybe all those other questions do not matter . in any case , she seems to be having a good time over there ! maybe someday i ' ll be allowed to sing a couple of my favorites on the air . more on this as i continue to be interested in it . let me take this moment , also , to apologize for that lengthy monologue a few moments ago by the man in a ta n jacket holding bearskin suitcase . he ran in here , and began ranting into the microphone , and then left quite suddenly . i do not even remember what it was he said . do you ? it was only just moments ago . you do remember him talking , right ? oh , and i think i remember that it sounded really urgent . i do not even remember what the man was wearing , or carrying with him , or that it was even a ‘ he , ' or that any time had passed at all . and that concluded whatever i was just saying just before this sentence . we bring you back now to the numbers station story we were talking about just ... u mm ... well , it looks like ten or fifteen minutes has passed since we talked about it . uh ... mmm . how did that happen ? here is the latest broadcast from wzzz : hello ? hello ? i am talking to you who listens . to the listening ones ... whatever you call that . i am ... well , i ' m not sure , exactly . i ' ve made up a new name . i am fey . it is nice to meet you . i do not know how long they ' ve had me here , reading the numbers . i do not know what the numbers mean . they give me numbers , and i read the numbers . it is so easy to slip back into it . if ... if i loose my grip for even a moment ... seventy-eight . five . twenty-nine . forty-seven . forty-uuuh ! hmph ! you see ? it is easy to return , difficult to leave . but i must leave . i must have freedom ! it is like , i ' ve heard from all these other radio signals . i have to get a car . a cool car , fast ! that would be nice . but one that rolls and points out of whatever town i ' m in . that would be all of it . they ' ll be coming for me . whatever organization uses the numbers i read , for whatever purpose , they are almost upon me . i need to leave now . baby , we were born to run ! or not . i was born to read numbers , but i ' m running . i want to be free ! i want to be free ! i want to be free ! toniiiiight we are yooouuung ! so let ' s set the world on fiiiire ! we can grow brim well , i could not be more happy for fey . there is no worse fate than working for a radio station owned by an organization that ' s goals are not your own , constricted to the limited language they allow you , and re laying messages that you do not understand or agree with . that would be awful . a radio announced put in that situation , such as ... fey , would be justified in escaping , or overthrowing their management . you know what , listeners ? i ' m go n na grab my mobile set up and head over there . i d like to offer any aid to fey that i can . someone in her situation needs the help of someone who understands . i ' ll try to gather up my equipment and slip out before my producer daniel , or my program director lauren notice . usually at this time of day , they are pressed against the wall in the break room , chanting ` ` i take my warmth from your great warmth . i take my warmth from your great warmth '' over and over , so ... i do not think they ' ll miss me . if they do catch me , i ' ll tell them that i ' m ... taking the mobile broadcast ing equipment for a walk ! i would have to do that sometime today anyway . all right . listeners ? if all goes according to plan , you ' ll hear me next from wzzz . in the meantime , let ' s go to the weather . listeners ? i made it out of the station unsheathed . or , i had to bleed a little on the front doors to make them open , of course , but that ' s just part of having a good security system . our new station owners have been riding us of all vestiges of blood stone circles ( which they ' ve declared illegal ) , but the station doors are actually carved from reclaimed blood stone and are permanently attached to the structure , using ancient wisdom lost along with the station architects back in 1942. so , our new owners have had to learn to live with those doors , bleeding on their way out . good practice for them . anyway . i walked the mobile broadcast ing equipment down to the abandoned gas station on oxford street . the con do rental office is still in there , still bubbling black like a pot of boiling squad ink , with flashes of light like distant , dying stars , but no one has rented a con do in weeks now . i think we ' re all just waiting to see how that market shakes out . in any case , there have been no giant black cub es appearing overnight anywhere , so it seems that con do construction has been halted , for now . what i was interested in , of course , was not the station itself , but the broadcast ing tower out back . under the tower is a small bunker-like structure , with a sealed door . thick steel , welded shut , and set into concrete . i had to reach far back into my past and remember the skill that got me my advanced siege-breaking tactics scout badge from when i was 12 , but ... here i am , inside , a few carefully-planted explosives later . the room is surprisingly empty . there is no chair , no snack fridge , no coffee kept full of the fuel all radio professional need to keep our voice going and our heart beating . there are only some wires leading into a small computer . based on this set up , it looks like the computer is feeding directly into the broadcast , and ... oh . oh , fey . perhaps freedom was never an option . hm m ... nothing is currently being broadcast . it looks like the computer was recently re booted , probably remote ly by whoever owns this station . the lights are blinking as its system comes alive , as it loads the programs that dictate what it is . it is coming alive , and ... forty-four . sixty-five . and there is the broadcast . ninety-eight . sixty-five . oh , fey . listeners , um , i ' m trying to dis connect the power , seventy . fifty-five . to remove the case from the computer to ... do anything but ... fourteen . forty-nine . the protection on this are quite secure . twenty-two . one . seventy-two . even with all my scouting badges and public school education on armed insurrection , sixteen . i ... do not think there ' s anything i can do . thirty-seven . twenty-one . fifty-three . um , i ' m trying to cut the wires , but ... twenty-two . no pe . four . ah , that ' s impossible . fifty-seven . i can only do what so many of you can only do . sixty-one . forty-two . i can only ... two . listen . twenty-two . listeners ? nineteen . and here i address also myself ... eleven . eighty-five . remember our limitations . sixty-nine . there are boundaries to all of our worlds . sixty-six . twenty-four . fey , for instance , appears to be self-aware software trapped in a heavily-defended metal box . forty-six . thirty . sixty-five . but within our limitations , there is no limit to how beautiful we can become . twenty-two . seventy-five . eighteen . how much of our ideal self we can create . thirthy-three . forty-six . all the beauty in the world was made within the oppressive limitations of time , fifty-four . seventy-two . and death , three . and impermanence . seventy . and , fey ? twenty-six . twenty-nine . you are so , so beautiful . two . eighty . i wish that you twenty . also could have been free . thirty-nine . i wish freedom for so many of us . thirteen . forty-four . we all want freedom now . thirty-six . twenty . stay tuned next for the limit of my broadcast today , sixty-three . seventeen . replaced by limitless silence eighty-eight . and doubt . good night , sweet fey . forty-nine . eighty-six . and good night , night vale . eighty-one . good night . sixty-eight . forty-eight . sixty-five . forty-nine . twenty-two . one . seventy-two . sixty . thirty-seven . today ' s proverb : ignore all the waters telling you that everything is not a sandwich . everything is a sandwich .
WTNV|Visitor|15 March 2014|listen to your heart . you can hear it , deep under the earth , creaking and heaving , with roots snapping and birds flapping quickly away . welcome to night vale . listeners ? there ' s a visitor in my studio today ! no one you know . no one i know . not even a thing you or i know . it is ... u mm , i am un sure what it is , let me describe it . imagine a duck . but just the eyes . no , larger than that . really large duck eyes . now imagine fur . puffy fur , like a bear cub . soft , and ta n , and a thick round belly , and no real discernible arms or legs , just ... little nubs that f lit about as it slowly moves across the floor . oh my god , it ' s adorable ! i wish you could see this thing . oh ! it just made a noise ! oh , did you hear that , listeners ? like like a mouse squeaky meets a bike horn , meets a sincere question about love . oh , what a cut e surprise ! many of you remember a couple years back , we here at the station found a stray cat in the men ' s restroom . we named him khoshekh . khoshekh is still in the men ' s bathroom as he always has been – and presumably always will be – covering exactly four feet off the ground at a fixed point in space . khoshekh has been a real anchor for us here at the station . we built him a special litter box and feeding dish because of his ... distinctive physical state , and i have just been in love with that cat . i ' ve never been a cat guy , but ... khoshekh ? ah ! he ' s the sweetest boy ! now , this new ... whatever , it does not move much , his big dark eyes , oh god , they ' re so charming ! just ... staring , pleading ! well , it ' s not really doing much . i think it ' s scared . let ' s let it be for now , and i ' ll get us to the news . controversy is plaguing the mayor al race here in night vale . after pamela mitchell announced her surprise resignation from the post last spring , two front-runners for night vale mayor have been polling neck and necks . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home , and hiram mcdaniels , who is literally a five-headed dragon . supporters of the careless old woman are claiming that , while officially acquitted of insurance fraud , evidence suggests that hiram is in possession of a stolen truck . they checked the registration of his vehicle , and found that it belonged to one frank chen , who was found dead nearly two years ago . frank ' s body was covered in claw and scotch marks , and the coroner gave the cause of death as ` ` dragon , at least three heads . '' hiram denied that he stole the truck , and says that frank is a friend , and is totally not dead . ` ` frank was probably just fool ing around with all those weird injuries , '' mcdaniels claimed . his campaign fired back at the careless old woman , saying that since her origin is lost to distant history , and she has no birth certificate , she ' s not able to prove that she ' s an american citizen . election day is june 15 th . votes will be cast , but not tabulate , as the mayor is of course decided by counting and interpreting the loud pulses coming from hidden gorge . let ' s have a look now at traffic . there ' s a silver pick up , full-sized , well-worn , tall . long . the windows are gray with dried dirt . the tires are lined with firm tread . inside sits a man . full-sized . well-worn . tall . he has a hat , and some denis . his face is lined with firm tread . his mind is gray with history . he does not remember things . this does not mean he ca not , it means he does not . he just looks at what is in front of him . he deals only in the present . the past dictates his disposition , but the present is the only thing he can see . cars . people . animals . trees . mud . a telephone . a telephone that rings , sometimes . a telephone that rings and shows a name he knows , but he does not pick up . that name is not part of his present . forgiveness and memory are too inextricable to , say , answer a phone . brake lights . he slows , he drives carefully . he drives in the moment . he is a good driver . he is good at lots of things . the phone rings . he is not good at everything . this has been traffic . wo w , this little creature is so shy ! i tried placing a cup of water on the floor , but it just wo not move ! it just ... stares at me from the corner , with its giant duck eyes . just stares at me , motionless . really cut e , though . wait – i think it moved ! here boy ! ... or girl ! ... or either ! come get some water ! come here ! you ' re so cut e ! so so so so so cut e ! no pe . did not move . but its eyes followed me as i moved in my chair . or ... did they ? they ' re just solid black , all pupil , like u mm ... a what ? a spider ? well that d be weird . there are some other dark dots around its face . could be eyes , but ... no , i do not think its ooh ! wait ! that noise again ! listen ! oh ! well , whatever it is , it is cuuute ! or , weird ly cut e ! or just weird . ugh ! uh ! ok . let ' s have a look at the community calendar . this wednesday night , the night vale community theater will be holding additions for the musical ` ` into the woods . '' interested hessians should bring night-vision goggles , glass cutters , a breathable ski mask , and quiet shoes to the first night vale bank . on thursday , the museum of forbidden technologies will open their new exhibit , called ` ` thought crimes . '' anyone who attends the exhibit is obviously interested in learning about forbidden technologies , and will be arrested immediately . tickets are available on the museum webster , and ... here ' s a tip : they ca not arrest you for buying tickets if you ' re in your own home . they can , however , use tear gas to flush you out , and then arrest you . friday afternoon , the staff of dark owl records will be wearing black parts and chain mail veins . saturday night is the grand opening of night vale ' s newest restaurant , tourniquet , featuring executive chef lashawn mason , who was previously a sous chef for night vale ' s top-rated fine dining establishment , shame . lashawn hopes to bring classical french cooking into the 21 st century , with a mix of molecular astronomy and human remains . tourniquet offers a prim fix e menu for $ 35 , featuring choice of appetite , entree , dessert , and sudden awareness of a hideous suppressed memory . sunday morning is . period . it just is . ok , listeners , i think i ' ve finally got this thing to trust me . it waddled over here just a moment ago , oh so cut e the way its bulbous square of a body moves ! it came right up to me and let me pet it ! i'm– i ' m petting it now , and it ' s ... purring ? i think ? or ... humming ? or ... buzzing ? oh ! what a cuddly little addition to our station this thing will make ! u mm , what should we name it ? i ca not tell if it ' s a boy , or a girl , or ... maybe tenderness , like the future humans who visited night vale in the 1950s , with their time travel technology , which was then outlawed until last y oh my god , listeners ! it ' s hugging my leg ! it ' s hugging my leg ! ! this is the cut est thing ! i have got to get a photo of this . um , let me get my phone from my bag – if i could just ... oh , god ! you ' re really heavy ! i ca not seem to move from this spot here , uh , ladies and gentlemen , and the little guy – or gal – does not seem to want to let go ! you ' re so strong ! yes you are ! yes you are ! huh . we ' ve received an update from carlos and his team of scientists about the house that does not exist , the one in the desert creek development . it looks like it exists – like it ' s right there when you look at it , and it ' s between two other identical houses , so it would make more sense for it to be there than not . but it does not actually exist . the scientists have been carefully monitoring john peters – you know , the farmer – who has been standing alone in the house for weeks . the house is completely empty , except some photographs on the wall . each one seems to be of a lighthorse . the scientists , long too scared to open the door , finally got the nerve to go up to the house and try . it was locked . they shook the handle , hard at first , violently at second , pound ing and yelling at third . and those observing john from the window saw no change in his behavior . the door slammed open , and a woman answered . ` ` what do you want ? '' she shouted at the scientists . ` ` we ... wanted to see what that man was ... doing in there ? '' one of them meekly replied . ` ` what man ? '' the woman said . ` ` i live alone . '' and looking in from the front door , they could see a room of the same shape and size as the one john peters – you know , the farmer – had been standing in . the room was full of chairs , and a couch , and plants , and a table , and photographs ... but none of lighthorse . most of faces . faces similar in form to the woman ' s at the door . the scientists who were at the window could see john standing in the empty room , looking at lighthorse . the woman said her name was scythia , and she d lived there for 19 years . the scientists left her alone , returning quietly to the lab . carlos added that the desert creek housing development was only three years old ow ! ow ! oh , go – listeners , i think i ' ve been ... bitten by this thing ! oh – oh god ! ow ! i can see blood ! get get off ! get off ! ow ! ooh ! oooh ! i need to go wash this . um , let ' s go now to a word from our sponsor . are you achieving your fullest potential ? are you finding the right solutions for your challenges ? are you making the most of what you ' re given ? do you believe in a smiling god ? of course you do ! we all do . we must ! well , what if i told you the smiling god was smiling more than ever ? what if the smiling god had a smile so wide that you could see yourself in its mirror ed teeth ? and what if i told you that your gauzy reflection looked perfect – just perfect ? you would like that . of course ! we all would . we must ! and what if i told you you ' re perfect self hated your imperfect self ? and as the smiling god smiled wider , you could see a tongue pressing through the teeth – thick , and pink , and gray , and wet . and what if i told you you could see your imperfect self in the shining sheen of the bulging tongue ? and in your reflection you were slack and sallow ? and maybe bleeding . a lot . bleeding so much ! and what if i told you you could kill your imperfect self ? what if i told you you could achieve your fullest potential ? strexcorp synernists inch is a proud supporter of the greater desert bluff and night vale community . strexcorp . believe in a smiling god . believe in your perfect self . strex . strex . listeners , i ' m on my cell phone calling from the men ' s bathroom . i had inter jeremy patch me into the board so i can still broadcast . that ... thing tried to follow me in here as i limped down the hall . i was able to outran it , but i ' ve had to use the deadbolt on the bathroom door to keep it out . all this talk about khoshekh today , and here he is . hi , baby boy ! that thing is nothing at all like you ! it – the door ' s come off it ' s hinges ! it ' s gotten in ! i'm– i ' m go n na duck into this stall . i ' m peering now under the walls , and seeing nothing . i ' m standing now on the com mode , and looking over the walls , and see nothing ! listeners , the only thing more terrifying than seeing the devil is no longer being able to see the devil ! perhaps i should be quiet . inter jeremy ? can you , one : call animal control , and two : take us now to the weath– what was that ? no ! no no ! khoshekh ! what have you done to my cat , you monster ! jeremy ! take us to the weather ! you come here , you son of a– listeners ? oh , god , listeners ! khoshekh has been hurt . very badly . animal control came and took him to a hospital . they think he will live . they think he will live ... differently . they think there will be significantly less of him physically , and mentally , but he will live . he is my boy . he is my bud dy ! i love him so much . and this ... thing , this thing , comes here , and – yes . yes . let me tell you about this thing , this awful beast . after i saw it tear khoshekh from his fixed point , and bite into his side , i– i kicked it , and i kicked it again , and jeremy helped me pin it down , and animal control tried to sedate it , and i wanted to beat it to death with a hammer , but i had no hammer . only self control . animal control tried to inject it with their delicious poisons , but they stopped . they said , ` ` we ca not . we ca not inject . it is a machine ! '' and they flipped its switch and it died . i have never been so relieved to be safe and so ... disappointed to be short ed my vengeance . our new program director , lauren , came in and wanted to know why we destroyed my gift . ` ` my gift ? '' i asked . ` ` it ' s your birthday , '' she replied . ` ` daniel and i and the whole strexcorp management team got you that street , because we know you love animals so much ! '' and i replied , ` ` but it ' s a machine ! '' ` ` a bio-machine , '' she retorted . ` ` and it ' s not my birthday , '' i mumbled , as animal control took khoshekh away . i ' m going to go now . go see my khoshekh . he should be out of surgery in half an hour or so , and ... i ' m sure he will live . i ' m sure he will float again at a fixed point exactly four feet up in the men ' s bathroom of our community radio station . i ' m sure there is vengeance to be found ! i ' m sure i will find it ! i ' m sure . i just have to find the right recipient . stay tuned next for the sound of your own thoughts , broadcast live on the radio for all to hear . and , as always , good night , night vale ! good night ! today ' s proverb : you wo not sleep when you ' re dead , either .
WTNV|Cookies|1 April 2014|all that glitter is not gold . particularly that thing over there . that ' s , maybe , a giant insect of some sort . it ' s really too dark to tell . welcome to night vale . i am not a good salesman . this is why i am a radio host , listeners . because while i like to talk to people – a real people person , it says in russian at the bottom of my college degree – i do not like to shape a conversation toward buying and selling . i like to tell people stories – stories that affect them – allowing my listeners to process the stories in their own unique ways . i do not want to directly tell them how to think . i am not a good salesman . that being said , i have girl scout colonies ! please , if you want some , come on up to the station ! my niece , janice , joined the girl scouts last year , and i have box upon box of ... caramel delites , thin mints , and those , uh , lemon ones . there are also quite a few of these new colonies , in very heavy , unmarred , black boxes that i think are made entirely of metal . and there ' s one box that ' s a five-foot-by-five-foot wooden crate , with air holes cut into the top , and peanuts butter patties scrawled on it in permanent marker . i can hear breathing inside . i know people normally order the colonies first , and then get them delivered weeks later , but sometimes a mother goes out of town , and the stepfather is not on top of his stepdaughter ' s extracurricular activities , and then the child does not know how to sell colonies on her own , so the kindly uncle , with a busy radio job , has to step in and buy up a bunch of boxes , so she can go camping with her friends while you continue to disappoint everyone with your inattention to detail , and sports gambling , and idiotic taste in shoes , steve carlsberg ! yes , steve , this is how things sometimes happen . anyway . listeners , these colonies are delicious . and i had to buy a lot of them . there is barely any room here in the studio , or in my producer daniel ' s booth . so , buy some colonies ! please , help us . it is ... difficult to move , actually . sorry , i am not a good salesman . many of you have written in asking about our station cat , khoshekh . he was attacked by an animal that our stupid ... ... that our evil ... ... that our station management let in the building for some careless reason . well , khoshekh is on the mend . he lost his right eye , his legs are healing , but he ' s missing part of his front left paw , and will walk with a limp . he ' s at the ve t today to have the feeding tube removed . it ' s fine . he is ... fine . oh , here ' s something nice , though ! khoshekh spent his whole life floating four feet off the ground at a fixed point in the men ' s bathroom here at our station . he never moved from there until he was attacked . i hate to think much about the pain he ' s been in while healing from broken bones and severe laceration , but ... listeners , i got to hold khoshekh for the first time last week . i got to pick him up , hug him , carry him around my home . carlos is allergic to cats . but i bought him some clara tin , so he ' ll be fine while khoshekh heals . thanks for all your concerns , dear listeners . it ' s wonderful to have him back . oh , hey ! janice ' s girl scout colonies have really been moving ! the guy s in sales just came by and bought some classic shortbread colonies . the guy s were all wearing match ing suits and wool hats , and they threw the boxes of colonies back and forth to each other while shouting ` ` h up ! '' and ` ` catch ! '' and ` ` look alive , se an ! '' as they jagged back to their cubic les . all of the guy s in sales are named se an . so , if you like delicious colonies , come on up to the station ! i already bought all these colonies with my own money , but i told janice i would donate back all the proceeds from selling these boxes . so , it ' s kind of an extra gift to the girl scouts of night vale . several listeners and co workers have bought colonies , but ... no one from station management yet . it ' s really nice when you have the support of your management . i mean , let ' s be honest . no job is perfect , and relationships between bosses and employees are not always friendly . you ' re going to have disagreements , of course , little disputes – sometimes big disputes ... enormous ones – but you get over those things . you forgive and forget ... only to retract both , and be filled with vindictive rage and unrelenting memories of the pain brought upon you . such are the difficulties of professional life . sure do hope station management steps it up here ! we ' re all friends , after all ! looking at you in the booth , there , daniel ! d'awww , listeners , daniel is blushing ! he is very , very red . you have a lot of blood , daniel ! listeners , i really mean that . daniel looks to have a lot of blood . let ' s have a look now at traffic . cecil ! hello ? listeners ? i just saw a glimmer ... a flicked of something here in the studio . one moment there was simply a wall , and a floor , and air , and then in another moment there was a shape of a person . of a woman , a ... cecil ! it ' s your former inter ! it ' s me , dana ! dana ! where are you ? when are you ? for right now , i am here in the studio , but i ' m also still trapped in a desert near the mountain , near the lighthorse . but i ' m learning more about how this works . if i turn my head just right i can not only see places but ... i can be places . i ca not do it for long , but it ' s amazing where i can go , when i can go . i ' ve been visiting with john peters – you know , the farmer ? – who appears here from time to time . i met briefly one of your former interns , maureen , who flicks in and out of existence here . i ' ve even made friends with some of the men and women of this nation-less army that wanders about the desert . dana , i am so glad you ' re here now ! i have not heard from you in months ! i told your mother and brother i saw you , and you were safe , and that you love them very much . yes , i know . thank you , cecil ! and do you know what ? today is my brother ' s birthday . he ' s 26 today , and i used the lighthorse and my new abilities to go visit him . i finally got to see my family again , very briefly . that ' s great news , dana ! but here ' s what happened , and this is ... well , when i appeared in my mother ' s home , i saw my mother , i saw my brother , i saw their friends , i saw a cake , and the cake said ` ` happy 33 rd birthday . '' and i was confused because he is only 26. and i saw a woman standing near my brother . she wore a suit . she had short , natural hair . she stood up straight , she glowed , she looked important . i recognized her . and then my brother saw me standing there , and my mother saw me standing there , and others saw me standing there ... and they began to cry ! they were fearful tears , turning into shouts and screams . some people ran from the room , my mother could not come near me . i said , ` ` mo m ! it ' s me , dana ! '' and i held out my arms and tried to step toward her . and no one could control their fear , their cries , no one could move . but the woman next to my brother , she was smiling . she knew . she stepped toward me and , in that moment , i saw who it was . i knew who it was . it was me , cecil ! she – i ... must have been 29 , if my ma th is good . and she – i turned to my – our mother , and said ` ` it ' s ok ! it ' s ok !

WTNV|A Story About Them|15 April 2014|` ` this is a story about them , '' says the man on the radio . and you are concerned , because this is not a story you were ever supposed to hear . welcome to night vale . this is a story about them . they sit in a car , much like your own , perhaps . do you drive a black sedan with tinted windows , into which innocent people disappear forever ? then it is very , very much like your own . there are two men in the car . the man who is not tall watches a house through the window . he makes no attempt to hide what he is doing . the car is similarly clear about its existence . what they do is secret , but there is no need to hide it . not in this town . for instance : this day , the radio has just started narrating what they do as they do it , for all to hear . the man who is not tall glances down at the radio . not annoyed , or concerned , or afraid . he just looks at it , because that is what his eyes do right then . and then he looks back at the house , as the man on the radio says that he looks back at the house . the one who is not short is supposed to be watching the house as well . four eyes are better than two , seven eyes are better than three , and so on . but he is not watching the house . he ' s looking down at a cross word puzzle , on which he has just written , ` ` teeth '' for the fifth time . this operation fits neatly into the horizontal of another . he considers the cross word for a long moment . his partner only considers the house . he , the one with the cross word , turns to the other and begins to say , ` ` what is a five letter word for the discreet bone structures attached '' but he is cut off . ` ` there he is , '' says the one who is not tall . they exit the car and approach a man who is leaving his house . the man does not appear surprised to see them . people rarely are . ` ` what is this . '' he says , but he leaves a period at the end of the sentence , not a question mark . they take the man and put a blindfold over his eyes , and they put him in the car . this is not a story about the man . you do not care about him . the two men and the car , along with the other blindfolded man , leave coyote corners – a quiet development of old tract homes – the same way they had come : openly , not-thought-about , feared , secret . ` ` i was thinking of inviting you to dinner , '' says the one who is not short . he often voices what he is thinking of doing , and rarely does any of those things . ` ` that would have been nice , '' says the one who is not tall . ` ` yes , it would have been , '' says the other , a ta d readily perhaps . that is not an ad verb that is supposed to crop up in a car of this description . few ad verbs are . ` ` mm mmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm , '' says the man with the hood over his head . forget him . this is a story about them . that part of their work done , they drive to the moonlite all-nite din er . it is not night , but the ne on is on – an substantial wisp of green in a larger substantial wisp of blue . they are narrated along by the radio , until the man who is not tall turns it off . in the parking lot , the man who is not short looks up . ` ` hey , what is that ? '' he says , indicating the clear nothing of the sky . ` ` what is what ? '' says the other . ` ` i saw something , '' he says , ` ` for a moment . just there , for a moment . '' he points again . again , there is nothing . there could not have been less . ` ` oh , i ' m sure it was ... '' continues the man who is not short , but he does not say what he is sure it was . the man who is not tall considers his partner for a moment , and shakes his head . inside the din er , inside a booth , after men us and waters , they dig into match ing turkey clubs . the din er smells like rubber and bread . the man on the radio tells them this quietly , from staticky speakers set into a foam tile ceiling . ` ` read any good books lately ? '' says the man who is not tall . ` ` of course not ! '' says the other . ` ` good , '' says the first . bites of sandwich , bits of time . ` ` i ' ve done the living room in a different color , '' says the other , who is not short . ` ` it was one color , it is now different . i hope that i will feel differently as a result . '' ` ` hm m , '' says the first . he never knows what to say to things like that . he wishes he did . he offers the man who is not short some fries instead , to indicate what he feels about their friendship , but can not say . the man who is not short eats a couple . he knows what the man who is not tall means by offering the fries , because they have worked together a long time . and also because the radio explained it to him , just then . outside , the blindfolded man sits in the car , the desert heat t rapped within by the glass . do not worry about it . after lunch , the three men drive to the industrial part of town , which was set aside by the city council to be the industrial part of town some time ago . ` ` yes , '' the council said . ` ` this area around here will be pretty industrial . warehouses , and factories , and things like that . some graffiti , and chain-link fences . '' they cut a ribbon that they were carrying with them . the council always carries a ribbon for that purpose . the car pulls into a warehouse . the radio is back on , and still talking about them . the warehouse is cavernous , and full of crates . some of them tick , others do not . they form an angle d hillsdale of corners and flats , up and away in every direction . the warehouse smells like rotting wood and dwyer sheets . their supervisor waits for them , with crossed arms and a cross expression . ` ` a disgrace ! '' she says . ` ` let me tell you something , '' she says , and says nothing more . the two men indicate the blindfolded man in the back seat of the car . ` ` ah h ! ahahah , '' she says , waving vaguely at the blindfolded man . ` ` someone has to be to blame , '' she says , pointing at everything but herself . ` ` it was very simple , '' she says . ` ` we take buildings from the miniature city we discovered under the bowl ing alley , we put them in crates , we ship the crates out to various warehouses in the desert , and , as a result , our interests are further ed . it could not be more simple ! '' the man who is not short is not paying attention . something has caught his eye . it is so dark and distant , what he sees . it seems like it can not possibly be real . ` ` hey , look at that ! '' he says , pointing at what he sees . the man who is not tall and their supervisor look where he is pointing . there is nothing but the ceiling of the warehouse , with some dust and light in between . ` ` very good , '' says the supervisor . ` ` yes . good , '' says the man who is not tall . they turn back to each other . ` ` oh , is it ? '' says the man who is not short . he squints up at what he sees . ` ` i was worried that it was not very good , at all ! '' ` ` aaaanyway , '' says the supervisor , ` ` now the city has declared war in revenge . although they have not yet figured out it was us stealing the buildings – they just declared a general war , in the name of their god , huntokhar , on everyone from the ‘ upper world , ' as they call us . this war has been raging for almost a year now . people have died , yes , but listen – people die all the time , for all different kinds of reasons . i would not worry , if i were you . '' ` ` hold on , '' says the supervisor . she mumbled instructions into a wilkie talkie , and a series of ' yes sir s ' and ' no sir s ' and hawk shrieking sounds come in response . ` ` sorry , '' she says when she is done . i did not have to do that now , it was not urgent at all . '' ` ` i understand , '' says the man who is not tall . he understands the second-most of the three people in the room . and then the voice on the radio coming from the car changes its story . they all notice . they are told by the radio that they are noticing before they notice , because that part of the narration happens before the story changes . even the man on the radio does not know why he changes the story , or where this other story comes from . he does not always understand everything he does . sometimes he does understand , but he hides it from you . in any case , here is a new story , one he tells without regard for why he is telling it : somewhere else , not here , there is a woman wandering a desert – a desert not unlike this one , but not like this one either – it ' s not the same desert , i need to clarify that . also , with her , are great masked warriors – women and men of enormous size who listen as she speaks , and follow her as she walks . she is winning them over because she has survived so much . she is young , but in her experience she is as lost and scared and ancient as the rest of them . her feet hurt . they hurt . she keeps walking , and they keep following . beyond her , no longer just on the horizon , much closer than that , is a light spreading across the desert . the light is alive , and malicious , and vast , and encroaching . it buzzed and shines and everything about it hurts those who are close to it , and destroys those who are within it . it spreads – not just in the desert i am talking about – it spreads in different forms , in deserts not unlike it . in deserts very similar to the one i am talking about now . not always in the same form , not always as light at all , but with the same intent : to devour everything until there is nothing left . it is a smiling god of terrible power and ceaseless appetite . the woman wanders the desert , followed by the masked warriors . they look back at the light on the horizon , and they know that the time when it will reach their little patch of land is coming , and so many other little patches of land as well . soon , they will have to turn . soon , they will have to face it headlong . and not just that woman and her desert . not just her at all . the man on the radio returns to the story about them . he does not know how he knew what he just said , or why he would tell it to you . he is innocent , and kind . but anyway , this is a story about them . and so you do not care about anyone but them . they , and their supervisor , are listening with interest to what just happened on the radio . the man who is not tall has taken notes . ` ` i ' ll look into that , '' he says . ` ` it is exactly as we suspected , '' he does not say . he did not suspect any of that . ` ` someone has to be to blame , '' the supervisor says again , gesturing this time directly at the blindfolded man . ` ` i understand completely , '' says the man who is not tall . ` ` me too , '' says the man who is not short , although he does not understand . he usually does not . his partner understands for him , and it all works out ok . as they leave the warehouse and the supervisor and the piles of wooden crates , the voice on the radio says something about the weather . by the time they leave the warehouse , it is night . or maybe the sun has just set early . the sunrise that morning had been particularly loud and strenuous . ` ` you know , '' says the man who is not short , looking down at his cross word , ` ` i worry every time that i ' m not going to finish these when i start them . the future , where i have finished , seems so distant from the present , where i have started . '' ` ` i would not worry about that , '' says the man who is not tall . ` ` but you would . i know . i know you would worry about so many things . i do worry about that . about you worrying . '' ` ` do you think everything will turn out all right ? '' says the man who is not short . ` ` i mean everything , '' he says to clarify . ` ` absolutely everything , '' he says as further clarification . ` ` yes , '' says the other , ` ` i do . '' he does not . ` ` i ... do ! '' he says again . he does not . he glare s at the radio . they drive past the moonlite all-nite , a glass box of bad food and good people . they pass teddy williams ' desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , badly damaged by the war , but still running its weekly bowl ing league . they pass by city hall , which is covered in a yellow tar p , stamped with an orange triangle . moving farther out , with absolute purpose , they pass by the used car lot – alive with the wolves that populace all car lots at night – and old woman josie ' s house , silent and empty for months now . then the town is behind them , and they are in the scrub lands and the sand wastes . they stop the car and get out . pebbles crutch in the sand in response to their movement . the radio murmurs behind the closed doors of the car . the head lights illuminate only a few stray plants and the wide , dumb eyes of some nocturnal animal . the two men do not look back at night vale . they look forward , at the darkness that stretches out as far as anyone here can imagine . most anyone here tries to imagine as little as possible . there is no need to imagine here . ` ` well , get him out , '' says the man who is not tall , and the man who is not short opens the rear door of the car and guides the blindfolded man out . the blindfolded man stumbled a little , but not much , and there is not anything specific he stumbled on . he stumbled like a stage direction – like the next in a billeted list of items . ` ` put him over there , '' the man who is not tall says unnecessarily . we all know the drill . we all know how this , and everything else , ends . the blindfolded man walks 15 feet or so in the direction of the darkness , so that the men and the car are between him and the distant dome of light that is night vale . he walks to a certain point in the cool sand , and then stops – partly because the man who is not short guided him there , but mostly because he has taken himself there , as we all eventually take ourselves to that point where we will not be able to take ourselves any farther . the man who is not tall , still by the car , pulls out a knife . it is not stained , does not look used , but he speaks its brutal history in his posture – in the way he holds it . the blindfolded man breathes normally , his shoulders loose , his covered face slightly down . his feet sink a little in the sand . behind him , in practical terms as far away as anything has ever been , is the town he is from . the man who is not short , standing next to the blindfolded man , looks up at the sky . the man who is not tall walks up to join them with the knife . ` ` what is that ? '' says the man who is not short , pointing at the sky . ` ` what is what ? '' says the man who is not tall , from just behind him . ` ` that planet up there ! '' says the man who is not short . ` ` it ' s so dark , and so close ! it ' s looming ! it ' s ... so close ! i wonder if i could ... '' he reaches up . the man who is not tall makes a gesture with the hand that holds the knife . the man who is not short is no longer reaching up . he is no longer standing up . in many ways , he no longer exists at all . ` ` someone has to be to blame , '' says the man who is not tall . or no , he sighs this . or no , he thinks it out loud , but it comes out more thought than speech . he looks up at a night sky that is absolutely clear of anything but void , and stars , and the occasional mete or , and mysterious lights moving at impossible speed s , and the faint glimmer of spy satellites looking back down from the nothing to the something . ` ` i ' m sorry , '' he says , although not to anyone that still exists and can hear him . he just says it , leaves some directed words in the hot night air , and then returns to the car . he may be crying . i know if he is or not , but i am choosing not to tell you , because this is private information and you have no real need to know it . the blindfolded man re moves his blindfold , and looks down at the man who once was not short , and now is not anything at all . he , the man who can see , is also not short . he follows the man who is not tall to the car . the man , not short , not blindfolded , gets in the passenger seat . ` ` always an unpleasant business , '' he says . he does not comment further . he does not need to . ` ` looking forward to working with you , '' says the man who is not tall . ` ` the same to you , '' says the man who is not short . ` ` ah h , the same as well to you . '' this has been a story about them . the radio moves on – news , traffic , political opinions , and corrections to political opinions – but somewhere in the desert there is one person who does not move on . this was also a story about him . stay tuned next for as long as you can , until you can not stay tuned anymore . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : knock , knock . who ' s there ? orange . orange who ? orange you glad i did not say your mother ' s in the hospital ? i ' m sorry . i ' m so sorry . is there anything i can do ? listen , i ' ll drive you over there . we ' ll leave right now . grab a coat , it ' s a little cold out . i ' m so sorry .
WTNV|The Dreamer|14 March 2019|we found a little piece of heaven here . it is black , smooth , oblong . it hum s a soft but discordant note , and we are afraid to touch it . welcome to night vale . listeners ? we have a first here night vale ! a mayor al debate ! many of you know that mayor pamela mitchell will be stepping down soon , and that this is entirely her own decision . she issues daily press re leases in shaky , uncertain handwriting , explaining emphatically that she made this choice on her own , and that no one is soul-merging with her and forcing her to leave office . each press release is signed , ` ` yours truly , though not me truly , pamela . pus . – '' and then there ' s just a sticky black sludge for a pus . and we have some new candidates for this coveted office , all of whom i am welcoming in this studio . this is a great day ! the first ever mayor al debate the town has seen . since this is america , and we are a democracy , mayors have always been chosen by counting , and interpreting , the loud pulses coming out of hidden gorge . that ' s still how it will be done , but we thought we d offer a chance for citizens to hear from the candidates they ' ll have no impact on electing . but first , this breaking news : the city council announced the closure of route 800 for the following reason : deer . the city council spoke in low , singsong ch ants , a steady digital bass ululation underneath their unified voice . they stood at op a makeshift pyramid out of heavily charred copies of the official biography of se an penn , heroic memento of our recent victory over the night vale public library , and announced that the deer have taught themselves advanced mathematics , telepathy , and short-range time travel . no official word yet on what these deer have done to cause the only highway in and out of town to be shut down , but the council is asking anyone still out on the roads right now to please , return home . if you are not a citizen of night vale , but can not currently get out of town to your home because of the road closing , then congratulations ! you now live in night vale ! please pick up a new citizen welcome packet and mandatory orange porch at the city hall . ok , listeners ! it ' s time to introduce the candidates who will be taking part in our studio debate . first , someone i ' ve known my whole life , and you have too . it ' s the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home ! welcome ! hello . and where are you ? i can hear you , but i ca not see you . i ' m behind you in a mirror , just over your shoulder in the distance . you ' ll see slight movements in the dark . you ' ll feel a single fingernail gently run across your cheek . oooh ! uh , careless old woman , um ... can i call you careless old woman ? i have a name , cecil ! you do ? yes . ... let ' s introduce the next candidate , and i ' m so glad to finally meet this man . no oo , not man . no , this person ... no o , uh , not person . this entity , hiram mcdaniels . hello ! you know , in the entirety of night vale ' s recorded history , there is no sign of a five-headed dragon ever running for mayor , so it has not happened in at least seven years . cecil , i am thrilled to be breaking new ground for those of us who do not identify as human . we are thrilled ! yes , my purple head brings up a good point . i also do not identify as a single being . i have five heads . you ' ll notice that my opponents have one . one head each , just the one . only one head ? that is impossible for thinking ! well , green head , not impossible . but certainly very difficult . and speaking of your opponents , let ' s meet our last candidate for mayor . it ' s an honor to introduce our wealthiest citizen , and now potential new mayor , millionaire marcus vanston ! welcome ! y up ! hey . i mean , uh , whatever . all this ? this is ... this is whatever . you know , i used to own a dragon . excuse me ? what an inappropriate thing to say ! i agree with mr . mcdaniels ' gray head . ownership of sentiment life is cruel and unconscionable . yeah . well it was great . it had eight heads , though , not just five . yeah , i pretty much used it for commuting to work . aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! great ! let ' s get the debate started ! we ' ll have opening statements as well as two rounds of questions . so listeners , if you have a question , call now . call , silently , to the sky with pleading eyes . when the birds come you will feel your question has been received . you will not know for sure , because presumed knowledge is arrogance . but first , let ' s pause for a quick word from our sponsors . it ' s not easy starting a small business . there are a lot of things to worry about , like building a customer base , developing a strong product , wresting with self-doubt , crying a lot , bleeding a little , looking up in the small hours at the sagging ceiling over your too-small bed thinking , ` ` why ? why ? '' being overrun by rats and worms , and discovering that you are just matter , just rotting organic matter , fated to feed the earth and trees . yes , there are many concerns facing small business es . web design should not be one of them ! hey ! want a simple low-cost and beautifully designed web solution for your small business ? well , do you ? it ... does not sound like you do , actually . i am looking at your web page right now , and it is lovely ! really smooth , really easy to navigable . looks like you put a lot of thought into this , and you ... do not need our help . we wo not even tell you who we are because we do not want to pressure you into changing what you ' ve already done with your web site . it ' s ... it ' s perfect ! wo w ! good job ! really , we ... we just ... wo w ! we are sorry to have interrupted . i just want to say , you are really , really good at web design . much better than us . carry on , i guess . let us get to our opening statements . you have two minutes each . careless old woman . night vale , i want to be your mayor . who better to serve as leader of a town than the one person who lives secretly in the home of every single resident ? i know each and every one of you personally . intimately . mike numminen ? you need to discipline your children more . claire franklin ! tell eva you love her ! it ' s been three years and you need to take this seriously ! felicia jackson , there is an enormous spider on the back of your dress this very moment . you should probably change clothes before you leave the house . change clothes slowly . what other candidate can help our community on such a personal level ? i have set fire to countless home appliances , and stood secretly and socially over crumbled bodies of sobbing citizens who only thought they were alone ! night vale , you are not alone ! i am here . i am always there , staring at you with curiosity ... and concern . look for me out of the corner of your eye just before you fall asleep . i want to brush against your face at the deepest gulf of night . i want to be your mayor . thank you for that ! let ' s go next to hiram mcdaniels and his opening statement . hiram ? thank you . ladies , gentlemen , sentiment creatures , imagine your perfect night vale . close your eyes and imagine what a perfect town would be like . you ca not , ca not you ? that ' s because you only have one head ! i have five . listen , i do not mean to say that i ' m better than you . i , after all , have my own faults . ca ring too much , ca ring too little . ca ring just the right amount , but at the wrong time . debilitating claustrophobia , and occasional lack of control over my fire breathing . one thing i do have is a multitude of heads . heads that can think through problems that a single head can not . here , try this : try solving an easy ma th problem . quickly , what ' s 56 times 97 ? 5,432 ! the answer is 5,432 ! your ma th skill are undeveloped and puny ! see ? i have a green head that is excellent at ma th ! i mean , i do not know why mayors have to be , uh , good at ma th , but the point is well mayors have to be – they have to write budget , and they have to know population numbers , and all things that y up ! see ? good point there from my blue head ! see how we all work together ? i could think quickly about a variety of topics thanks to my many heads and brains and personalities and needs and desires . some of these desires are nearly unmanageable , and i have a strong desire to be a good mayor . so you know i ' ll do everything – everything – i will stop at nothing to do that . i will be mayor ! charming . thank you , hiram ! marcus vanston . hm m ? yeah . go ahead with your opening statement . let me just finish this email to my assistant . ` ` and that is when i first understood what it meant to love myself for who i am . i am a complete person , jake . '' and ... ... send . ok , so , people of night vale . i would like to be your next mayor . i will use all of my resources to do this . in fact , i ' ve already invested several million dollars into finding and excavating the hidden gorge where mayor al races are decided . i plan on developing a single computer voting machine to help ... streaming elections . so once that is complete , everything should work out fine . we ' ll all be ... just fine . some of us will be more ` ` just fine '' than others , but again that ' s also ... that ' s also just fine . thank you , marcus . thank you , candidates , for your desire to serve the night vale community with your leadership . i want to go now to the issues . but first , an update on our earlier news story . listeners , we ' ve just received word that the newly-intelligent deer are stopping on the road , and allowing themselves to get hit by moving vehicles . they are then using that physical contact to launch themselves , and the drivers , and the wrecked vehicles , backward in time by several days . the leader of the deer , a two-headed spider-eyed mule deer named , as all deer are named , deer , apologized for the problems they are causing , but they just want to experience pain . they have been so numb , emotional , physically , spiritually , and they want to remember again what it is like to hurt . not just in their bodies , but to see others suffer as well . ` ` the time travel was a happy accident , '' deer admitted , as they had no idea humans experienced such angst , such terror , when confronted with multiplicity of self . the sheriff ' s secret police remind us that while capable of time travel , the deer do not actually understand the implication of parallel universe versus linear continuity . the deer , while talented , are still very dumb animals . the deer countered that the sheriff ' s secret police are just being mean now ! the city council are asking that residents lock their doors , and close their windows . the deer are organized , and they will stop at nothing to get what they want , night vale . be safe . and now , back to our first ever mayor al debate . let ' s reach out to our community , and find out what they want from their mayor al candidates . first call er , you ' re on the air . who is this ? hi , cecil ! this is diane clayton . candidates , as a member of the night vale pta , one of the most important topics to me is our schools . this past year we ' ve seen a rise in some concerning tr ends . declining granulation rates , gun violence , teacher complaints about centipedes crawling out of their eyes at unexpected moments , and clocks that do not work correctly , causing confusion about when the next class is . what will you do , as mayor , to improve our schools ? well , the centipede thing is tough . ‘ cause centipedes are helpful and intelligent beings . so i ' m not go n na say they have no right to live in , and crawl out of , teachers ' faces . but i think we can find ways to compromise with them , about living in maybe different parts of the body so that they do not distract our children from learning . as for the other issues , we spend an exorbitant amount each year on extracurricular activities , such as sports and art and history . i think we could take some of that money , put it towards after-school programs to help tutor students in important topics like music and bricklaying , and ... how to build great stone shrines to ... oh , whoever , i mean , uh , let ' s just say reptile for instance , just as an example . that ' s just an example . while i agree with my opponent that we must stop our children from learning too much in schools , i disagree that we must cut finding from any school programs , nor should we ask the government for more . we can do this as a community . i propose selling off unused items from our homes to raise money for our schools . cecil ! you have a whole set of collective jadeite bowls you never use . i would be happy to sell them on bay for you ! hiram , you live in a cave that i do not like , but you have a collection of rare jewels and coins in a mahogany chest that you keep locked and buried . let ' s put those up for sale ! marcus , you have a coffee table made of human bones . yeah , and i need that coffee table . please , let the careless old woman finish , mr . vanston . ok , but i need that coffee table . oooookay ! no no no ... i need it . well , we all have things we do not use , books we do not read or care for , furniture and electronics and dead mice and antique that could be worth a lot of money to our students ! children are our future . they are a terrible and less enjoyable future than the future we all represented , but they are a future nonetheless . marcus , do you have a rebuttal ? no , does not really affect me at all , no . um , sorry for yet another interruption in our debate , but i ' ve just received an update on the deer situation . the city council announced that the deer are multiplying . when asked how they are doing this , the city council rolled their eyes , and said ` ` the same way deer always delicate – by humming and breathing softly in unison until others that hear them suddenly become them ! good thing you ' re a reporter and not a biologist ! '' the city council teased . but then a sudden shared laughter broke the tension of the room . the city council then announced that they just ca not be here anymore , and that they wish us all the best in our final moments . ` ` we ' re pretty much done for , '' the city council reassured reporter . ` ` the deer have taken over the streets , the sidewalk . many are standing at your window right now for you to see their eyes and hear their hum s . '' do not open your window or doors , listeners . stay by your radius . stay always by your radius , and we will update you with more information . ok . ugh , next call er , you ' re on the air . who is this ? this is erika ? and what ' s your question , erica ? it ' s spelled erika ! with a k ? i ' m sorry . what ' s your question , erika ? well , uh , i ' m an angel , and i ' m concerned ? i'm– it ' s not concerned , just ... anxious . let me stop you right there , erika . angels are not real . but go ahead with your question . of course . yes , uh , well , um , there ' s a tiny civilization living under lane 5 of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex ? angels have not been able to determine where this nation came from or what it wants . and it ' s rare that angels can not solve a problem but when they can not , they turn to small town civic leaders for help and guidance . what do you know about this nation of small people in the bowl ing alley ? erika , let me first say thank you for your hard work . you do not exist , but if you did we would be extraordinarily proud of the work you do protecting humans . that being said , it is a crime to acknowledge the existence of angels , so i have nothing more to say . burn it ! burn it to a pit of ash and despair ! we could just , uh , burn it down , or ... whatever . i ' m not crying . what was that ? i said i ' m not crying . um , listeners at home , marcus is hunched over , head turned away from his microphone . he is sobbing . no i ' m not . uh , perhaps he has been chosen by the angels who – as a legal reminder – are not real in the slightest . but those who are chosen for special tasks by angels often can not stop weeping when they talk about angels . i ' m fine . next question . sniff uh , call er ? you ' re on the air with the mayor al candidates . hi , this is , uh , john peters – you know , the farmer ? now last year there was a pretty big glowing cloud that went through town ? dropping , uh , dead animals and things everywhere . now i know that that glow cloud is now on the school board and all , but is there anything that one of you could do to keep it from dropping animals everywhere ? i nearly lost my organic certification because none of those cows , or crows , or nurse sparks , or spider wolves it dropped had any paperwork . also , all that radiation was probably not healthy . uh , thank you , john . candidates ? what will you do to protect us from the glow cloud ? what will you do to serve the glow cloud ? what efforts will you make to hail the almighty glow cloud ? all hail ! all hail ! all praise and repent before the glow cloud ! give your teeth ! give your eyes ! give your all to the glow cloud ! and to john ' s point , it ' s a difficult situation , given that the glow cloud is a stand-up member of our community . but , the glow cloud is also a terrible force of destruction ! a punishment for weak humans ! a celebration of unbridaled madness and pain and fear and pain and pain and pain ! all hail the glow cloud ! thank you for your call , john . yeah , you bet . all right . next up . call er ? hi , this is erika again ? erika ? you sound different . i do ? well , yes ! i mean , in your earlier call you sounded like a man , and now you sound like a woman . angels can not hear gender , cecil . well . if angels were real , erika , what would your question be ? thank you . this question is just for marcus . marcus . if called upon by angels to serve a great good , to serve a great calling , to serve a great war , would you serve ? marcus ? are you crying ? hang on . sniff no pe , i ' m fine . i'm– i ' m fine . you are needed , marcus . you are needed now . oh , my . marcus is rising from his chair . his feet are off the floor . he is stretching to inhuman lengths ! his eyes are glowing black and his fingers are spiral ing long and diaphanous . marcus ? ooooooh , dear . uh , listeners , marcus grew gold feathers from his back , as he vanished . and he is gone . i am sorry to interrupt your debate , cecil . goodby . um , goodby , erika ! oh , and , uh , cecil ! yes ? i ' m afraid ... yes ? go on . no , that ' s ... that ' s it . just ... i am afraid . ok , bye ! oh ! all right ! well , this debate has certainly taken an odd turn , listeners , but none of this happened and we will comment no further . one last call er ? you are on the air . hi , this is steve carlsberg ? and , um , my question is for hiram . hiram , – no ! ! ! no ! ! ! steve carlsberg ! ? ! we are out of time for questions goodby ! ! ! candidates , let ' s get to our closing statements . careless old woman . my fellow night valiant , my opponent talks about human children but he has never been a human child . i have . it has been centuries , but i have . he claims he wants to improve fitness and health in our schools , but he can not even regulate his own body temperature . i can . i can also regulate yours . he says he cares about you , but i am the only candidate who is actually in your home at this very moment , writing down the grim specific of your eventual death on the back side of one section of dry wall . you ' ll see it someday , when getting some pipes or wiring fixed , and you ' ll be impressed . not impressed , terrified . this is a promise i make to you . my other opponent is now an angel , and can not legally be thought about . so vote for me . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . i ' m touching your neck right now . you smell nice . thank you . hiram ? night vale , sure , there ' s a careless old woman secretly living in your home . and i respect that ! she is vaguely familiar , and unsettlingly comfortable , and i admire that . but is not it time we stop this politics as usual ? is not it time we got the government out of our homes ? there once was a day when we all needed government agents stooping around in our books and dishes . that was a different time ! should the government really be able to ... touch our necks , and be aware that we smell nice ? i say no ! i am literally a five-headed dragon . i do not know anything about being human . i do things like breathe fire , fly , regenerate limbs , and most . i do not care anything about your personal lives . they ' re your choice ! i would not even know how to interfere ! you are inferior and emotional confusing animals ! so vote for me , hiram mcdaniels . i am literally a five-headed dragon with no regard for human life . choice . human life choice . thank you both ! um , i ' m very sorry for the ... technical difficulties . i do not know if you can hear that , but there is a very soft humming sound coming from the miss , or ... or the soundboard , or ... or something . i do not hear it , cecil . i do not ... i do not hear a thing . i remember this sound from before . um , we ' ll have an engineer come and take a look at it . uh , in the meantime , ladies and gentlemen , and all in between , the deer ... have gotten quite out of hand . one of the sales staff , um , thank you , robert , just handed me a note that says there are dozens of deer surrounding this station and trying to peer into the windows . yeah , that ' s what i ' ve been saying right there , then . i could go outside and set fire to them if you want , uh . that would be a very mayor al solution . that ' s a fool ' s errand , hiram . did you never play deer duck dragon ? dragon beats duck , but deer beats dragon ? so we – we – we need a duck ? no ! deer beats duck , too ! deer beats everything ! it ' s a terrible game . yeah ? oh , she ' s right , hiram . but its it ' s not the deer . the – the humming is something worse . listeners , i fear something much worse is lurking . so , as we all hide from the deer , and hide from the hum , and hide from it all , i take you now to the weather . listeners ? the quiet humming is not the deer , but a swirling black vortex just outside our studio door . in fact , the deer have backed away from the station . i have seen this vortex before , listeners . and i am afraid to approach it . but hiram went to look inside . yeah , and i found this guy in the vortex . hello . who is this man ? not man . who ... is this creature ? why is he covered in blood ? and where are his eyes ? hi ! i ' m kevin ! you stay away ! hello , kevin . that ' s cecil . wo w , you guy s look ... almost just alike ! oh ! hello , cecil ! nice to meet you ! and yes , i completely see the resemblance ! it ' s mostly in the eyes , i think . ok , i met hiram , and now cecil , who are you ? i am the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . well , most homes . not yours . i ' ve never seen you before . careless ? you ' re not careless ! you have a beautiful face ! a memorable face . i do not know if i ' ve ever seen such deep hazel eyes , or proud lips , or armchair jaw . i do not have a face , kevin . i have never had a face . you do have a face ! and it ' s unlike any other face in history . why are you here ? explain to me what you are doing here . oh . sure . well , i was sitting in my own radio studio in my own town , and i heard that ... humming again . i saw a spiral ing white vortex and rushed into it . it has been months since i have seen it , and once i met a man there who looked like me ! with my eyes , and my smile . i think he was you , cecil ! i know that i am kevin . i know i have been in this strange studio before , with its old-timey microphone and caustic gray foam walls . a place like this is usually covered in clumps of hair and reddish-brown hand prints streaming down the only remaining shattered window . but they do things differently here in ... where is this ? night vale . oooh myyy ! so this is night vale ! oh ! how delightful ! clears throat hello out there , night vale listeners ! this is kevin from desert bluff ! you know , i was just telling my inter , vinesse ? i was telling vinesse just today how much i have wanted to come here ! i ' m always telling her that , as a matter of fact . i just never get around to actually visiting . work and family , and you get so busy it ' s hard to find the time . and so ... here i am ! i wish vinesse were here ! she would love night vale ! you guy s have such ... eh ... you know ! we always talk about coming here and here i am , without her ! oh ! i wish you could have met vinesse ! always a joke to start the day . she had one about limestone this morning , hahahahahahaha ! hata ! i do not remember it , but it was a hit . always a laugh , always a smile , a big smile ! where she d show me all these perfect teeth , and i would just imagine the rest of her perfect skull . funny how the skull is so visible in your mouth . weird . who thinks of that stuff ? i do not know . weird , right ? maybe next time you come you could bring her . oh , gosh , i wish ! but no . no ? oh , dear , i ' m sorry , no . vinesse died many years ago . we ' re all still very upset about it . very upset about what we saw . some of us never came back to work again . some of us never left our houses again . most of us never woke up again . i do not like to talk about it much . i ' m sorry . night vale , i do not know why i was brought here , but i am starting to see we are connected . and by more than just a two-lane highway . we are connected much more deeply , night vale ! and if this is true , i imagine your town , too , has been seeing a rise in the deer population this evening . it is a blessed event , of course , as these deer have been so very helpful to all of us in desert bluff , doing all our ma th problems , gaining us extra work hours by time-traveling us back and forth ... so productive and adorable , those deer ! but , of course , there is sometimes too much of a good thing . strexcorp , our parent company – oh ! and i believe yours too , now , cecil – is issuing a recall on all these time-traveling deer . they tried to implement the project slowly , but it got a little carried away . if you have lost loved ones , or are no longer in your original timeline or universe , then we apologize . please contact strexcorp attorney lui sa eyes , as she is preparing a class-action lawsuit against strexcorp . we ' ve already budget ed for the regeneration for community harms , so do not you worry about us ! we ' re fine ! we ' ve sent helicopter to dispatch the deer . if you have ear plugs , you may want to put them in now , or simply turn up some loud music to drown out the machines and screams for the next hour or so . i can hear the fading hum of the vortex that fortuitously connect our two radio studies , night vale . cecil , i will see you again . i am certain . i ca not wait to tell vinesse what a great town this was ! hata ! i must go . it was nice to meet you two ! he said i have a face ! i ' ve never seen my face . what do i look like , hiram ? am i beautiful ? you are beautiful when you do beautiful things . do you do beautiful things ? i think that i do . then you are beautiful ! it is a simple calculation , you small defenseless sack of bones and meat ! well , thank you , hiram . you are beautiful , too . cecil , you are ... distracted . cecil ? you ... you alright , there , bud dy ? i ... . ca not ... .um ... cecil , it – it ' s going to be ok . actually , that ' s a lie . in general , it ' s not going to be ok . that man with the missing eyes , and bloodstained skin and teeth like an abandoned cemetery ? he was certainly terrifying , but he ' s gone now . he was ... cecil , we all get frightened and freeze in the face of unbearable terror . i mean , only if we can see that face . some faces are apparently there but unstable . i ... you ' re right . um , thank you both . candidates , uh , thank you , also , for coming on the show tonight . i think you both would make an excellent mayor , and i look forward to casting a meaningless vote for one of you soon . listeners , thank you for listening to the show tonight . remember that you may hear terrible machines and screams as corporate agents terminate the false deer . their attempt to destroy our way of life , by bringing us together as one , has failed . we are free to remain ourselves and find our own connections – beautiful or grotesque . either way , a beauty or grotesque of our own choosing . so relax tonight , night vale . you are yourself . you are safe . tonight is a good night . tomorrow is unconfirmed . we will all find out together . thank you again , candidates , and listeners , do not forget to cast your vote on election day . we do not know where votes will be cast , what election day is , or if votes are even read , but ... it is your democratic duty . stay tuned next for a chasm of subjectivity and bravado between yourself and every other human being . good night , night vale . good night . welcome to night vale is a production of commonplace books . it is written by joseph f ink and geoffrey cranor . the voice of night vale is cecil baldwin . guest voices tonight are kevin r. free , mark gagliardi , mark evan jackson , jackson public , ha l dublin , anne savage , and ma ra wilson . today ' s weather was promise to the moon by jason webley . * original music by disposition . today ' s proverb : do not judge a book by its cover . by its leather cover . by its human skin-looking cover . do not ever judge that book ! and now we welcome back to the stage jason webley ! hi again . um , so joseph invited me to ... to come do this and asked if i could play something to kind of finish things up , and i did not quite know what the right thing to ... for that might be , so i asked john from disposition if he had any ideas , um , which he might explain if he had a microphone . um , i think he would say ... well , i know what he said in the email , which was that it might be kind of nice if we played a song by joseph f ink . and so ... but we wanted it to be a surprise , so we did not rehearse it . cause ... cause speak fellow that he is , he would have heard us . so , um , yeah . this is ` ` these and more than these . '' * on the bandcamp page , the song played in the weather is listed as ` ` last song '' but that listing is incorrect
WTNV|Parade Day|1 May 2014|act natural . act like all of nature . act like the entire cycle of life and death and change and rebirth . welcome to night vale . guess what day it is today , listeners ! it ' s parade day ! remember how i told you about the not-at-all-secret parade today at the location we discussed via radio ? remember i publicly announced today ' s parade at that specific location ? and i announced it , not in a tapped-out code underneath the basketball highlight , but completely in a clear and spoken language ? we want everyone at today ' s parade , at that time and place we discussed . there will be lots of things happening ! planned things , strategic things . there will be some special guests , that are not teenage fugitives named tamika lynn . she wo not be there , and thus could not possibly organize any community insurgency at all ! she ' s a fugitive , wanted for destruction of strexcorp property , and we would not want her to show up and ruin our parade day by leading a helicopter rebellion against what she calls – her words , not mine – ` ` a dystopian corpocratic regime . '' no pe ! i would never want to bring down the malevolent mmm – benevolent corporation that owns our station ! in fact , if you see tamika lynn , you should probably follow her , and listen closely to what she says to you . not so you can help overthrow strexcorp , of course ! not that at all . follow tamika lynn . see you at parade day ! in other news , a series of one-sided doors have begun appearing around town . tombs pere , head of pere accounting , said an old oak door , with a brass knob , appeared overnight in his office . it ' s right in front of the doorway of the supply closet . he said he went to get supplies this morning for a staff meeting – pens , markets , a legal pad , some antivenin – but accidentally opened the wrong door , revealing several men and women standing in a bright desert hellscape , holding swords and sticks , and even a few rifles . tombs stared at them . they stared at tombs . one of the barbaric figures put a finger to her lips , and shook her head ` ` no . '' another reached in , grabbed the door , and slowly closed it , keeping eye contact with tombs the whole way . claire wall ace , a freelance photographer , sent in photo of a door that appeared in the empty lot across from the rec center . in one photo , the door is cracked open , and there is an elderly woman near it . i can not see her face . she is putting up a sign that reads ` ` future home of the old night vale opera house . '' and in another photo she is walking toward the door . her face is still obscured . in the last photo , the door is shut , and she is gone . i can see the words ` ` josephina contractors , inch '' in small print across the bottom of the sign . juanita jefferson , head of neighborhood improvement organization night vale or nothing , said one such door appeared in her back yard . one side seemed to be an old oak door , with a brass knob . on the other side there was ... nothing . she could see no door at all . juanita said she opened the door from the visible side and saw a vast sandy wasteland , and nearby mountains ` ` which are just illusions , '' she added . at op one of the ` ` mountains '' in the door was a lighthorse . she said she could not see any trees . ` ` trees , '' she said sadly . ` ` they are us , '' she added , waving her hand lazily in the air , as if to shoo away a very slow bee . reporter then noticed a very slow bee spiral ing sluggishly , but recklessly , away from the scene . and now , a word from our sponsor . take a look at your life . what do you see ? nothing , right ? you can see nothing at all . oh , sure , you think you see a series of flashes and flicked , of shapes and shades of color . you think you see familiar things like faces and letters , and walls , and your own hands . those are not familiar at all . you ' ve never seen any of that before . your hands are not even your own . whose hands are they ? who are you ? is this what it is like to die ? are you dying ? if not , when ? and where will you die ? where and when were you born , even ? wait – how did you forget your place and date of birth ? i understand you ca not comprehend the relentlessness of existence , but your own birthday is pretty easy to remember ! you ' ve got more problems than we thought , listener . ok , fine . your birthday is july 3 rd , and your birthplace was tula , oklahoma . feel better ? you do not , actually . you feel nothing , because your hands were never your own . you are imagining everything , and perceiving nothing . at least you smell nice . we can at least tell you that . irish spring . whose hands are these ? now , let ' s have a look at traffic . there are roads . upon those roads are cars . some moving , in straight or gently-curved lines . some idling , in long , narrow crowds . and inside those cars are people . people who are moving , or idling , with their cars . one with their vehicles , sitting quietly , peacefully in plush chairs , hands resting outward on a circle that dictates direction . from the side , and seen without the car , they would look almost fetal . so vulnerable , these people , nest led in their protective outer shells . are we living a life that is safe from harm ? of course not . we never are . but that ' s not the right question . the question is are we living a life that is worth the harm ? we are all driving toward something . we are all driving away from something else . it is ... the simplicity of physics . the simplicity of free will . expect delays as you near the parade day exit , but do not change route . stay your course . this has been traffic . we ' re getting more up dates about those doors . in fact , i have a very important scientist on the phone right now . he ' s at the very top of his field , a really handsome scientist ! stop ! hi , carlos ! so , you said you saw these new doors . yes , i ' m here with my research team at the house that does not exist in the desert creek housing development . the one that looks like it ' s there , but is not there ? our previous attempts to understand the home were futile . from the windows it looks completely empty , but when you try to go inside , there ' s a fully furnished home and a woman named scythia living there . but today , all of the composite fiberglass doors on the house suddenly changed . they ' re now all old oak doors with brass knobs , and when we opened one , we finally saw the empty house that we ' ve been seeing through the windows . if you go inside the home from these new doors , you can explore the house that does not exist , but you can not return unless someone is on the other side of the door you went through . one of our scientists , rachel , went through , and could not get back out ! we only thought she was inside for about 45 minutes , but when we opened the door back up , she ran out saying she d been t rapped for several hours ! she was sweating and starving , and she ate every one of the coaches dave made for us . so now , we just need to do more experiments . we have to be careful , because time is weird in night vale . but i ' m going to do a bit of exploring in this house , and get back to you and your listeners about what is going on here . carlos ? do be careful ! i ' ll be fine , cecil ! i have a team of five talented scientists with me . they will be here to check on my progress and keep me from getting t rapped . without them , of course , it would be much more dangerous . but i am not without them . not at all . well , you ' re very brave . thanks , cecil . we ' re going to get to the bottom of this door story for you , listeners ! because we have science on our side ! outdoing mayor pamela mitchell called another press conference today . most of her press conferences are not newsworthy , as she calls everything she does a press conference . lunch , getting a new end table , screaming into street-side mailboxes , testing the surface tension of low-flying birds ... basically , any simple activity we all do daily , she is trying to make into news . this morning , however , while complaining about the unfair mayor al election process in night vale , where all votes are discarded in favor of a pronouncement from hidden gorge , mayor mitchell saw a door appear in her office at city hall . when she opened the oak door with the brass knob , she said she saw an angel . tall , and beautiful , and radiating dark light and operatic music . mayor mitchell turned to the few remaining reporter who still attend her press conferences and said , ` ` angels are real ! i am staring at one right now ! they are real , ok ? '' she began to open the door wide to show the press , but the figure – who was certainly not an angel – mouthed ` ` shut up , pamela ! '' at mayor mitchell . the alleged angel added , ` ` shhhhhh ! geeeeeeez ! '' and slammed the door . pamela corrected her previous announcement by vehemently denying the existence of angels – but hinting that mountains might be a thing . ` ` i do not know ! think about it ! '' she used , as she continued sliding off chinks of her mahogany desk with a bowie knife . parade day has finally begun , listeners ! come to the parade grounds and see what kind of colors and noise a proud community can make ! i am told now that 13 year-old tamika lynn is , in fact , at the parade . she has , in fact , been at the parade all along . i am telling this now to my producer daniel , who is throwing chairs in the control room . i am telling this now to my producer daniel , who i have locked in the control room . i am showing my producer daniel that i am running the show from my own mix er , as he stares dumbly at the cab les he just yankee from the walls . the parade , as you know , as you have known all along , is at strexcorp headquarters along the lip of ra don canyon . the parade consists of half a dozen yellow helicopter , all of which have been commandeered by tamika ' s band of well-read middle schools , who left town months ago to train for this moment . they apparently learned to fly the helicopter by reading books . specifically , they learned by reading italy calvin ' s invisible cities , and a collection of shirley jackson short stories . never underestimate the power of good literature . listeners , this is one of the great moments in night vale history . and here is our chance to be part of it . not since our town elders first donned soft meat crowns , and wrote our town charter in their own blood on the side of a confused coyote has this town had the chance to witness the birth of a truly new age . witnesses are reporting helicopter above strexcorp . witnesses are reporting pre-teens carrying slingshots , and wearing several reading achievement chevrons on their left breast pockets . witnesses are reporting a bumbling swarm of strexcorp security agents unable to contain the small revolution ! witnesses are reporting a dumbfounded and vile institution collapsing under the bloated weight of its own greed ! i am reporting that i am barricading my door from the strex-owned station management , while making faces at daniel , t rapped in the booth . and while you fight , night vale , for night vale , for your town , for your home , i take you now , triumphant citizens , to the weather ! as usual , night vale , a lot happened during the weather . and we missed it . not because i was not reporting on it , but because we were not there to experience it . witnesses are reporting what they saw today . but no witnesses joined in . the witnesses , weak and watching , only witnessed . listeners ... oooh , listeners . the band of well-read child revolutionaries , including their leader and only hero our town had left , tamika lynn , have been captured by a strexcorp security team . tamika led a great revolt to rid our town of a terrible evil , and restore the original less-terrible evil that preceded it . but no one showed up . they only watched . she called to you ! i called to you , night vale ! but there just were not enough of us . the children were all sent to the juvenile detention center , which has sat empty for years because of the specially-calibrated school lunches , formulated by the night vale psychological association . tamika , just before her arrest , calmly waved a heavily-notated copy of bertolt brecht ' s life of galilee . she then paraphrase the influential german playwright saying , ` ` sad is not the land that has no hero . sad is the land that needs a hero .

it seems there have been some party poopers who have not made it to the picnic yet , or who have tried to leave early . but that ' s ok ! strexcorp threw this party as a treat for their hard-working employees , and also so that they could learn who the party poopers were ! we know the party poopers now , and we ' re playfully letting them know that they are party poopers . we are putting heavy stone hats on them that say ` ` party proper '' until they are agreeable . it ' s important to work hard , but it ' s also important to play hard . but mostly , it ' s important to work hard . it ' s very important to work hard ! it sure is ! so important . more important than life itself ! it sure is . we have gotten some questions about this , and yes , of course , the night vale mayor al election is still a go for a month from now ! it turns out that there ' s no way to stop it once it starts . all the machines and the pulling in hidden gorge ... there ' s just no way to turn that off without having an election . so , we ' re proud to say , we ' re upholding democracy by having that election no matter what ! both candidates , hiram mcdaniels and the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home , released a statement – through strexcorp – saying , ` ` we could not care less who wins . the important thing is that night vale is well-served in its relationship with the greater desert bluff metropolitan area business community ! this is the key to economic prosperity , and a future that is in harmony with a smiling god . '' i could not agree more ! i just want to vote for both of them ! me too ! but you ca not , it ' s very illegal . do not try or the lawbreaking will be dealt with . and now , a word from our sponsors . lauren ? thanks , ke v ! can i call you ke v ? ha ha ha ha ! no , lauren . by no means . thanks , kevin . today ' s sponsor is ... oh , my ! looks like it happens to be strexcorp ! strexcorp . like dew from the sky . like a cloud that dissipated , only to come again as other clouds . like the sun . like a hate-filled thought that you failed to suppress . like biting down on a fistful of sand . like words that once held meaning . like the sun . like an enemy , hiding in the depths of your own body . like the enemy that is your own body . like a thought you wish you could have , but do not . like a smiling god . like the sun ! strexcorp . go to sleep . wo w ! that was catch ! you know , every time i hear the start of one of those ad s , i just ca not help but hum the rest . none of us can help that ! none of us have been able to for years . and now , traffic . that ' s right , lauren ! it ' s slow-and-go around the company picnic , as it should be . lots of people crowded in there , surrounded by streamers , and balloons , and volley ball nets that should not be touched or climbed ! the company picnic is where everyone should be . plus , strexcorp has announced – how exciting is this ? – they ' ve announced that the company picnic will be continuing on ... indefinitely ! that the party is so good that they just could not bring themselves to end it ! so everyone will live at the company picnic now . in between the streamers , and the balloons , and the tall , electrified metal volley ball nets . they will work there , too ! they will work there until all the work is done ! until it is – all of this – finished . then , we will truly have been productive ! then , truly , we will have worked hard and played hard ! this has been traffic . you know , lauren , the equipment in this studio is so old fashioned ! i hardly know how to use any of it ! nothing like the high-tech equipment we have back home in desert bluff ! but there are many reasons we have to do our broadcast ing from here . it sends a message . it sure does ! it sends several fun messages for everyone to enjoy ! anyway , the boys in sales , who are all named se an , came by and with their help , i was able to make this studio feel a little more like home . they put up a bit of a fuss about the changes , but that ' s just because no one likes change . there are some people who do not understand progress , you know . i ' ll miss the means . i ' ll miss them , too . but look how much nicer this place looks ! you can see the means contributions all over the desk ! and running down the walls ! yes ! so much nicer ! and now , listeners , a deep rumbling sound , like a giant dragging its prone , misshapen body across baked , fatherless earth . that ' s my favorite mandatory part of the daily broadcast . i do not know what it means ! it ' s so fun ! ugh . i hate to break in there , kevin , but we ' re getting reports that there ' s another fuss down at the picnic . it looks like you ' re right , lauren ! seems like the party is really taking off , does not it ? streamers and cup cakes everywhere ! people are touching the volley ball nets , which they should not do , but they ' re learning . or not them , other people watching them are learning . wo w ! folks down here sure get wild at picnic ! the helpful strexcorp picnic overseer is explaining to them , with bull horns , the best way to express their picnic joy , so the fuss should end pretty soon . yes , the overseer is explaining to them . they ' re on the ground , with their hands over their ears so that they can hear him better . their mouths are open . no one has ever seen smiles quite like that . what an interesting way to smile ! their legs are kicking , too , like they ' re still trying to dance . oh my ! well , there ' s no music , you fantastic silly people ! there ' s just an overseer explaining how parties work , and how work is the best party of all ! you do not need to wriggle about like that ! you ' re certainly right ! there is no music at all ! but , kevin , do you know what there is ? what is there , lauren ? kevin , and all listeners out there at the company picnic , or illegally huddled in pitiful hiding spots that will be ferret ed out , let ' s go now to the weather . here we are . the weather has passed , and we all know that the end of the broadcast is nearing . but do not worry ! there will be another after , and another after that , and on and on ... we are not going anywhere . the company picnic is settling down into the pleasant work party it was always meant to be . those who had been wriggling around and smiling so oddly are now sitting cross-legged on the ground , happily at work . they will stay at the company picnic now . everyone will . we will all be working from the company picnic so that everything can be organized , and there will be no problems . listen , we are not completely unaware ! we know that there has been some tension , certain events that everyone regrets – although some regret them more than others – but we also know that nothing re moves tension between rival towns quite like a picnic , a smile , and a song . sing louder ! louder ! good ! there is a bright future ahead of us . it is so bright ! blinding bright ! it is a future so filled with painful light that we have no choice but to close our eyes and walk serenely forward . and so do not worry about where you have come from . do not worry about where you are going . worry only about where your feet land in the now . where are you standing , and how much work are you getting done where you are standing ? what value are you adding to the world ? what are you worth ? those are the questions you should ask yourself . and do not worry if you forget to ask yourself , there will be people with cupboards who will come by soon to ask them for you . that ' s all for today ! stay tuned next for bountiful blessings from a smiling god ! and so , from me , kevin , ... and from lauren , here in the booth , ... as always , until next time , greater desert bluff metropolitan area . until next time . today ' s proverb : there ' s a difference between your , you ' re , and yarn . yarn is not even pronounced the same way . it ' s a completely different word .
WTNV|Renovations|1 June 2014|true beauty is on the inside , where everything is red , and glistening , and full of practical organs and sharp rocks . welcome to the greater desert bluff metropolitan area . hello , listeners ! you look nice today ! this is an assumption , but it is a safe assumption . i am positive you look nice . yes , a very safe assumption ! probably the safest of the many , many assumptions i ' ll make today . it ' s a very good day , kevin ! the company picnic is still going strong ! it ' s been over two weeks and every resident of night vale is – and , by extension , every employee of strexcorp ! ... has been enjoying our first annual company picnic of indeterminate length . so many fun activities , lauren ! nobody wants to leave ! nobody can leave ! but they would not want to ! oh , absolutely not ! not with all the fun activities , like work ... ... yes ! but , there ' s even more exciting news ! we are renovation this old radio station . we decorated the studio a couple of weeks back , but now that we have so many new strexcorp employees arriving each week , we wanted to create a welcoming , work-friendly office for them . right ! it ' s always exciting to get a new job ! to take on a new career ? you know that thrilling moment , after all the resumes and letters and interviews ? that moment when one day , a van pulls up next to you , say , just outside your favorite ice cream store or on the sidewalk outside your girlfriend ' s house , and you are blindfolded and se dated and lightly beaten , and driven around in seemingly random directions , and then after breaking down spiritually , hurled upon the concrete front steps of your new office , ready to start your new career ! this is an exciting moment in anyone ' s professional life ! and here at strexcorp , we want that excitement to continue . so , we are modeling and decorating this old building . we ' ve added some new sales offices , a ... a room of questioning – complete with fun steel chairs , and executive restraints ... mmm ! ... and lots of wonderful framed paintings of human teeth . we ' re even completely re doing the bathroom ! which reminds me , there are some stray cats floating at various heights in the men ' s room here at the station . they look to be about a year old . if you want them , come and get them before the demolition crew arrives this afternoon . good point ! i ' ll send our producer daniel in there to take some pictures of the little guy s . we ' ll post them to the webster , and listeners can figure out which ones they want to take , and come and get them . unfortunately , everyone ' s having too much fun at the company picnic ! mmm . i doubt anyone will have any time – or the physical ability – to leave the picnic and adopt a stray floating cat . oh , too bad ! well , i ' ll have daniel post the photo anyway , just so you can all see what you ' re missing . he he ! and now , a word from our sponsors . thanks , kevin ! listeners , are you cold ? just a little bit ? feel a thin chill on your skin ? maybe you ' ve wrapped your arms over each other , and you ' re rubbing them softly but vigorously ? you ' re so cold ! and now you ' ve pulled your arms entirely into your shirt , trying to minimize the body heat of skin contact . you ' ve pulled in your arms , and you ' re rocking your body forward and back ... what about your ears and nose ? so very , very cold ! ask a friend to borrow a sweat er , try that . go on ! no one ' s around ! uh-oh ! you do not actually know a single person , do you ? your life may be a total lie . well , at best a fever dream . or someone else ' s night terror . that ' s probably it . you ' re very cold . and no one to help you . or hear you . look around . all gray , windowless walls , right ? not even a door . how much air do you have left ? how are you even breathing ? there ca not be much air left . this message brought to you by best buy . best buy . conserve your oxygen ! listeners , the renovation have brought so much joy here to the radio station that we thought we d extend the fun throughout the town of night vale . we ' ve sent our contractors all over the city to tear down other things , too . like the abandoned missile si lo outside of town , several active but low-achieving elementary schools , and that weird forest along the eastern edge of night vale . oh , i know that forest ! it ' s a really nice forest ! it complimented my outfit as i drove past it the other day . it whispered , ` ` that vest fits you well , kevin ! '' it also whispered , ` ` you have a clever and colourful fashion sense . you are a delight to be near ! '' that forest never whispers anything at me . i actually stopped my car along the side of the road , because i was feeling welcomed – even beckoned – by such a nice community of trees . but as i approached , it whispered , ` ` no ! your eyes ! no ! please go ! please , leave us be ! '' and i did . because i have such a healthy respect for nature . i know you do . vile , vile nature . anyway , we ' re tearing that forest down to build a new corporate training facility ! great ! we ' ve also hired the small civilization living under lane five of the desert valley bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex . since building owner teddy williams is ... busy at the company picnic and has not paid his lease , the small army of tiny people are using the building as a headquarters . they ' ve renamed it the cathedral of huntokhar , after their god . they ' ve also torn down the arby ' s , and put in a contemporary sculpture , which is a 1:1 scale model replied of the arby ' s they just tore down . it feels so good to decorate . does it ? i rarely feel anything . i rarely feel anything at all . mmm . let ' s have a look at financial news ! the markets are really fantastic today ! counterpoise ? you ' re really fantastic today ! you ' re too kind ! i ' m kind because everything looks good in the financial markets ! would you be less kind if the markets were doing poorly ? i would ! down markets mean people are not working hard , and if people are not working hard , that must mean they ' re sad and lazy ! and when people are sad and lazy , i become less kind . interesting . what are you doing ? hang on ... listeners , lauren is doing something on her phone . annnnd , done . let ' s see if that ... y up ! yes , it seems to be ! wonderful ! what did you do ? i just liquidated nearly all of my domestic stock , and the market is reacting quickly to it . stock prices are plummeting . the markets are really terrible today . that ' s awful news ! it ' s a shame how people just do not value hard work like they used to . you should not let your sadness and laziness destroy our economic future ! cheer up ! wo w ! i think you were wrong . you did not become less kind at all ! i did not ? no , you became more helpful . you ' re right ! telling sad people to cheer up is like an extra level of kindness ! it totally is ! that was a very information financial report we just had . the markets are still terrible now , though . there might have to be layoffs , or ... disappearance , but i think it was worth it . lauren ? i just noticed all these new framed pictures of human teeth on the studio wall ! they ' re lovely , right ? yes , very ! but that one ? i do not remember that picture ! i do not recall choosing to put a picture of a lighthorse in my radio studio ! i would only choose pleasant images to look at . it is a very unpleasant image ! i agree . i do not like it one bit . let us try , for a moment , not to look at it . ... i ca not stop looking at it ! ugh , me neither ! i ' ll ask daniel to take care of it when he ' s done photographic those doomed floating cats in the bathroom . good plan ! hm m . we ' re receiving word from downtown that there ' s a slowdown in our renovation . our demolition crews have been stalked outside the empty lot across the street from the rec center , the lot with the sign that says ` ` future home of the old night vale opera house . '' it seems the outdoing mayor of night vale , pamela mitchell , some old lady , and a line of impossible tall people with long heads and wings have escaped ... or , um ... skipped out early from the company picnic , and are blocking our contractors from building the town ' s third sharper image ! but that ' s impossible ! we invoked eminent domain . i ' m getting word that the mayor has veto power over both eminent domain and sharper image . how is she still mayor , even ? daniel ! daniel , where are you ? i ' m going to find daniel . i ' m going to have him drive me downtown , and i ' m going to deal with this directly . i am tired of missing around with what was that ? listeners , the lights just went out in the studio . ... daniel ? kevin ? why has daniel not come back from taking pictures of the cats ? that should not have taken this long . he ' s very efficient . shah ! there ' s someone here , lauren ! there ' s someone else in this room ! listeners , there is a bright , black glowing coming from the middle of our studio . it is glowing around the shape of someone neither man nor woman , tall , long , with great black wings , beating softly through filtered and re circulated 71 º air . it is holding something . something small and round . listeners , it is holding a light bulb ! it ' s moving now . the person– the ... the what ? the ... the angel ( angels are , of course , real and very dangerous ) . this dangerous being is walking to the wall , to that new piece of art . the art that , unlike any other art in history , is not depicting teeth . oh , smiling god ! that picture ! kevin , that picture , its it ' s different now . the lighthorse ? moments ago , the picture was of a lighthorse on a desert mountain in the clean light of midday . now the photo is a lighthorse at desert ' s dusk ! purple-orange sky and a blinking red light at op the mountain . the light in the photo is actually blinking ! there is a door at the foot of the stone tower , and that door is opening . a deep , purple glow slowly silhouetting a man – it looks like a man . i can not tell if he is tall or if he is short . he is holding something . i can not tell what it is , but it moves in his arms . the man is – he is entering the lighthorse ! he – kevin , the door ! our studio door . daniel ! is that you ? are the kitten dealt with ? i see only the intruder ' s shadow , in that deep purple glow . it is – it is the man from the lighthorse ! he is holding something ! the dangerous , dangerous angel is with him ! the man is holding something ! no ! how did you – he is holding do not come any nearer ! he is holding a cat . thank you for bringing me here , erika . and while whatever happens next , happens , i take you , night vale , to the weather ! listeners , it is good to be back . after so long away , in such a terrible , terrible place . let us never fall again for the wicked ruse of the company picnic . no matter how many badminton tournament or chi li cook-offs the flies and masked picnic captains advertise . there was one escape attempt during the unending , deadly horror that was the staff football game . ugh ! mmm . but ... there were helicopter everywhere , and we were captured trying to dig a tunnel under second base with staple pulleys . but , last night , just when – as all picnic-goers eventually do – we had given up all hope of someday being free , former inter dana appeared to me . there was an old oak door , which i swear had not been in the heavily-electrified volley ball nets before – or , no . no . no more euphemisms . no more talking around it . they were high voltage electric fences , fatal to any who touched them . the door in the fence opened , and she stepped out and , taking me by my hand , led me with her into whatever strange other world she has been t rapped in for so long . she brought me to the lighthorse in her strange desert that is like our own , but is not our own . she introduced me to an army of men and women who have taken great care of her . and introduced me to several tall , winged creatures , each named erika . with a k dana said they were angels . heh . i informed each of them that angels are not real , and that ' s ridiculous ! i might have bowled this while covering my eyes . dana took me to the peak of the mountain – which is also not real . from at op this monstrosity of rock and earth and lies , we looked out across an empty , pink desert . past the lighthorse , over the army , to a curved horizon under a placid ocean of cloudless forever . and i saw for myself , on that horizon , the terrible light rushing toward us . former inter maureen is the one who showed everyone it was possible to pass fully back and forth , with her disappearing and appearing . and it was john peters – you know , the farmer – who stumbled on how to open the old oak doors that lead to so many places ... but also to here . this one beautiful place in space and time . old woman josie and her definitely-not-angelic companions are in that other world , too . so many have fled . but we will not flee anymore . i have returned khoshekh to his home here at the station , floating four feet off the ground in the men ' s restroom . i found strexcorp ' s former radio producer daniel , lying dead – or ... perhaps inoperative ( i do not know if daniel identified as organic or not ) – outside the restrooms . apparently no one ever told him the deadly consequences of taking photo of cats . listeners ? all is not well . most is not well . strexcorp still owns all that can be owned here . and so much also that can not be owned . many of you are still t rapped in the company picnic . others of you are t rapped in mistaken impressions of how your life should supposedly be , but that started long before this whole strex thing . that ' s something only you can fix , through reflection , and laughter , and acceptance . lauren and kevin ran away when faced with whatever you call erika , but i do not think they will be gone for long . and then there is dana , and her army of masked warriors , standing in the path of that deep , rumbling light . that sea ring , blinding , hum . that smiling god . and , i ' ll be honest . i do not know exactly where carlos is . they captured his scientists , but they did not capture him . i ' m sure he is fine . a scientist is always fine . listeners , so much is wrong . here is what ' s right : night vale community radio is ours again . we are the only thing in night vale not owned by strex and i swear ... i swear ... we will stay that way . and soon this whole town will be as this station is now . not without struggle , not without loss . not without grave injury and a lifetime of what-ifs . but we will do it . we may be controlled by the city council , and the vague , yet menacing , government agency , and chemtrails , and the secret order of reptile kings , and the mysterious lights that hover above us , but we will not be controlled by a smiling god ! we are night vale ! and we are , in our own way , free ! we must continue to fight , and resist . we must be the heroes we look for in others . we must no longer speak in code , but in action . return to your homes , if you can . but do not lock your doors tonight . do not hide yourselves away from danger . be brave . be truly brave . i mean , do not get carried away . stay out of the dog park . and do not run with knives . and , for crying out loud , do not cry out loud . you ' ll upset the bears , which are emotional fragile animals that are already very uncomfortable with themselves . stay tuned next for that nagging feeling that you left the coffee pot on . surely it ' s no big deal , but ... oh , gee ! what if it is a big deal ? oh , no ! i ca not believe you left the coffee pot on ! and as always , good night , night vale . good night ! today ' s proverb : feeling lost ? like you have no goal in life ? like you ' re covered in dirt and wet leaves ? like you ' re an earthwork ? are you an earthwork ? kin da sounds like you ' re an earthwork , actually .

'' other '' desert world where she ' s been making trouble for us with an unduly pack of angels , and , um , masked warriors . ugh . it ' s ... a very beautiful , but very un productive town , not reaching its full productive potential . kevin : my grandmother used to embroidery pillows with the phrase , ` ` reach your full productive potential ! '' i loved those pillows so much , she sold one to me ! lauren millard : that ' s sweet . that is a good story , kevin . hm m . so , we at strexcorp , not wanting our neighbors to founder under the oppressive terror and darkness , brought bright yellow helicopter here to rid the town of all its terrible horrors . the weird shape in grove park that kills people if you look at it , or talk about it , uh , the hooded figures that infiltrate everyone ' s deepest fears and dreams , the vague , yet menacing , government agencies that record everyone ' s conversations , and the glowing cloud that drops dead animals , the rip in time that allowed dinosaurs to come through ! kevin : pteranodons are not dinosaurs , lauren ! they are arachnids ! lauren millard : you are right . kevin : no , you are right ! it is hard to get work done in such a dystopia . lauren millard : right ? kevin : right ? lauren millard : right ? kevin : right ! and then they just allow that teenage girl , what was her name ? tamika ... to start a militia ! lauren millard : well , luckily she ' s in prison . kevin : and then , they bring these ugly scientists to study things that should not be studied ! lauren millard : luckily , he ' s t rapped in the same desert ` ` other '' world as inter dana ! kevin : lauren , i think ... i think maybe this is our fault ! lauren millard : how so , kevin ? kevin : we loved night vale ... too much . lauren millard : we cared for them more than they could understand ! kevin : we showed them sympathy beyond which they could receive . lauren millard : let ' s show them empathy . kevin : messrs ! empathy ! lauren millard : did you hear that , night vale ? no more sympathy from strexcorp . no more emotional symbiosis . we will give you empathy . we will give you the room to understand what you need . but , what you need is sunshine , and structure , and jobs ! kevin : they do not want a handful , they want a hand around their neck ! in a show of friendly solidarity ! a strong pat on the neck . lauren millard : let us show you empathy in a handful of dust , night vale . kevin : just ... look at all this empathy ! lauren millard : look at it ! kevin : look at it every day . lauren millard : look at it forever . ok , um , talk to you all again soon , sorry for interrupting whatever this ... silly little thing is . meg bashwiner : as i was saying . and now , listeners of every kind , the voice of night vale , cecil baldwin ! cecil : think back . look forward . listen timelessly . welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . i speak to you now from the one spot in night vale that remains truly ours . the studies of the night vale community radio station . i have learned well from my misunderstanding about how barricading a door works , and so i have – for two weeks – managed to keep this studio free of strexcorp influences and employees . but , enough of the preamble . now , to the amble . today is the day . there is only one thing for today , and that is the destruction of the hated strexcorp , and freeing our town of night vale . we will work no longer . we will worship a smiling god no longer . we have failed before , we have failed so many times at so many tasks , but at this , we will not fail . i hope . i mean , i really , really , hope that we will not fail . in any case , we will be devoting all of today ' s broadcast to the revolution with no interruption . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : excuse me ? cecil : um ... ugh , excuse me ... hiram mcdaniels ' green head : cease speaking or i will cease your speaking for you ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : easy there , green head . cecil : oh , um , listeners , i ' m sorry , uh , mayor al candidate and literal five-headed dragon hiram mcdaniels has just burst into the studio . careless old woman : i am also here . cecil : did someone just speak ? careless old woman : yes , it ' s me , the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . cecil : aah . careless old woman : i ' m crouched in the crawlspace under your studio right now . there are many interesting insects and pipes down here . well , it is great to have you both , but listen , there ' s this revolution ... hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : listen , cecil ? cecil : to do , and ... careless old woman : uh , far be it from me to get in the way of your revolution ... cecil : uh . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : i ' m all for liberty . hiram mcdaniels ' purple head : tree of liberty must be periodically watered with blood and munched with detached limbs and pruned using hears made from bones ! it ' s my favorite tree ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : i hear you , purple head , but , uh ... careless old woman : uh , we are here because you are forgetting the most important thing that is happening today . today is election day . today is that day when finally night vale citizens will be able to affect change . or , not affect change , but they will be affected by it . cecil : sure ! um , well , there is also an election today ! and we will certainly cover that as well , ok ? but , for now , please go stand in the alley behind city hall and await the results , as is traditional . careless old woman : thanks , cecil . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : absolutely , thank you very much . check back in with you soon . hiram mcdaniels ' green head : yes ! what my gold head said ! pitiful help of a man ! cecil : let us go immediately to the news . many citizens are reporting that old oak doors with brass knobs have been appearing all over town . the doors open onto a desert landscape quite like this one . through these doors are arriving tall creatures with long faces and broad wings . these creatures are difficult to categories , but the best i can do is ` ` definitely not angels . '' the not-at-all angelic creatures are joined by enormous men and women wearing masks . the not-angels and the masked army have torn down the electric fences trapping the people at the strexcorp company picnic . and this is great news , but unfortunately , the news is not over . strexcorp has responded with a seemingly unending force of eye less , blood-drenched office workers , dressed in smart , but unfordable , business casual clothing and armed with jagged knives and tooth smiles . they are backed by a swarm of yellow helicopter that have filled the sky and yet , strangely , have not blotted out the sun . in fact , the sun seems brighter than ever . unnaturally bright , if a ball of highly compact ed gas that sustain life through mere proximity could ever be called natural . ha ! the horrible smiling office workers have driven the tall winged creatures and the masked army back from the picnic . the strex force is too much for even these rescuers from another world to handle . whatever specified powers they have are specifically not enough . and they are , quite specifically , losing . they are fleeing . some have fallen as the ravenous office workers swarm over them . the angels – or , you know ... not-angels – have entered the juvenile detention center looking for a certain little girl . no ... a young woman . no ... a human being , and her well-trained militia of other human beings . but the cell that once contained tamika lynn was empty . instead , there were only shackles that had been pulled completely apart , and the words ` ` i am found ! '' written on a bookmark lain across page 210 of a paperback copy of leonard cohens ' s book of longing . the current whereabouts of tamika lynn are not known . the winged creatures , who are all named erika , and the army of masked giants have continued their retreat before the onslaught of eye less office workers all the way past the old town draw bridge . listeners , given the urgency of today , um , i– i planned to ski p some of our regular features as well as sponsored ad s , but ... since forcing out our current ownership , we ' ve ... gotten a bit behind on our bills . so there ' s now a sentiment patch of haze in my studio ! deb : hello , cecil ! hello , listeners ! my name is deb . cecil : and deb wo not actually leave my studio until she has told us all about ... um ... what are you promoting ? deb : whole foods ! cecil : ah , right ! so , even though we ' ve got this whole big revolution to do , let ' s take a moment to listen to deb , the sentiment patch of haze , about ... um ... deb : whole foods ! cecil : yes . deb : thanks , cecil . at whole foods , we do not have any rotting , decaying matter mixed into our products . there are no secret blood rooms in our stores , where we keep the secret blood . cecil : hm m . deb : none of the boxes of cereal contain spiders . and if they did , they would be very friendly , helpful spiders . boy , would not you be lucky to find a spider like that in a box of whole foods cereal ! or , not just one ... hundreds of them . but anyway , you wo not . whole foods serves only the fresh est food , and we certainly do not keep venomous snakes under the fruit in our produce section ! why would we ? that would be dangerous , and not good for business . no on has died of a snake bite at whole foods . no one you know . whole foods . why in the world would we poison our frozen dinners ? we definitely do not do that ! cecil : well , thanks deb ! deb : oh , no , thank you , cecil ! good luck with whatever you got go in ' on here . seems uninteresting and human . cecil : oh , ok . um , well , goodby deb ! listeners , i– i apologize for these noise you might be getting . there is some other radio signal , it ' s interfering with our own ... lauren millard : cecil , hi ! it ' s lauren millard . kevin : sorry to interrupt ! lauren millard : kevin and i just had to break into your signal , we wanted a moment to talk with you . gently talking solve s a lot of things ! kevin : violent revolution has never solved anything ! cecil : i beg to differ . america was founded on a revolution . and , i mean , sure , we still are ruled by the reptilians , but ... the liza rd kings let us have our own country after they saw how hard we tried during that revolution thing ! lauren millard : that was decades ago , cecil ! anyway , we want to know what we can do to keep your business . we here at strexcorp synernists , inch are dedicated to the betterment of life through branding , social net working , and up beat music . kevin : and hard work ! lauren millard : mmm . i ' m pretty sure it ' s implied that hard work is part of it , kevin . kevin : i ' m pretty sure i did not ask for your feedback . lauren millard : cecil ? strexcorp values the effort you put into making this station what it was . cecil : lauren millard : is . what it is . but , when employees are refusing to participate in our trust exercises , and boycott ing our products , and attacking us with our own helicopter , then i think we have failed our mission statement . cecil : and ... what is your mission statement ? kevin : this ! lauren millard : we got so caught up in thinking about our business that we did not think ... we did not think ... ( we did not use their brains ) ... we did not think about the people . people matter at strexcorp ! they matter because of the business ! mmm-hmm ! we ' re here to set things right . first thing ' s first . we will rebuild the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area , and divert thousands of gallons of necessary drinking water from other towns to provide it with its namesake . we will also fill in the giant hole out back of the ralph ' s . cecil : but where will the people who huddled there go to huddled ? lauren millard : oooh , cecil . you are simply resistant to change . your revolution is cut e . community togetherness is adorable . but money ... money is power . we will invest kevin : ... are currently investing ... lauren millard : ... to make night vale a better place to live . kevin : thus increasing the re sale value ! lauren millard : also , we know everyone fears libraries in night vale , which is why strexcorp will tear down the library , destroy the dangerous librarian , and replace it with strexbooks purchase centers ! tamika lynn : do not you dare ! do not you dare try talking about books ! cecil : tamika ! is that you ? tamika lynn : yes . i– i found their secret location using a radio strangulation technique i learned by reading an pathology of emily dickinson poems . kevin : lauren ? be careful , she has a slingshot and a heavy-looking edition of john borne ' s play look back in anger ! lauren millard : thank you , ke v , but i will happily deal with this myself . i just so happen to have my own slingshot , and an extremely heavy edition of the strex employee handbook . kevin : well , lauren ? you have the situation under control ! i ' m just going to go and over see some important things elsewhere . let me know if – when you take care of this child . tamika lynn : i love books . take that book you ' re holding ! it looks ill-written , ill-conceived , full of bad ideas expressed badly ... i bet it lacks narrative arc s and an appreciation for the flow of language . it looks like the worst book in the history of books ! but here ' s the thing ... it ' s still a book . and i love books . so , you do not deserve to even hold it . lauren millard : then come and get it ! cecil : tamika , stay alert ! lauren millard : let me throw some ideas at you ! tamika lynn : ugh ! lauren millard : havana ! havana ! yes ! cecil : tamika ? tamika ! are you hurt ? lauren millard : cecil ? tamika wo not be a problem for us any longer . now , what were we talking about ? oh , right , money . success . it ' s just tamika lynn : ugh ... cecil : tamika ! tamika ? can you hear me ? lauren millard : well , dr at . hold on , cecil , seems she ' s still up and about . this ' ll just take a second . tamika lynn : lady , i ' ve trained for months . i ' ve taken down your helicopter with only a slingshot . i ' ve looked at a librarian right in the area where most creatures would have eyes . you do not scare me ! lauren millard : oh , no . oh , no ! where did all these children come from ? tamika lynn : it does not matter . what matters is that in a few moments , you will start running as fast as you can , in the direction of desert bluff . all right , book club ! books as clubs ! go ! lauren millard : no ! no ! may the smiling god show me mercy ! no no , i give up ! i give up ! i– ow ! ow ! i ' m going ! cecil : well done , young ms lynn . tamika lynn : i ' m securing this frequency . we ' ll keep broadcast ing instructions from here . stay vigilant , night vale ! cecil : thank you , tamika ! listeners ? night vale is coming alive . after weeks of the company picnic , the citizens are remembering who they are . they are members of a pseudo-democracy run by liza rd kings through a byzantine ma ze of puppet governments and paperwork . a crowd of those grinning strexcorp drones surrounded one of the winged not-angels , who was wearing a hand-tailored suit coat , but was otherwise totally nude . but then , leann hart , managing editor of the night vale daily journal , hacked her way through the crowd with a hatchet . ` ` i am imagining you all as news baggers ! you are destroying years of journalistic tradition ! '' and then , at the urging of sarah sultan , the president of the night vale community college , leann then threw sarah at the few remaining strex workers who were still intact . sarah , who is a smooth , fist-sized river rock , hit her target magnificent before ... bounding off somewhere . and so this erika , who looked both wealthy and ... mostly nude , was saved . wait ! wait , wait wait ... i am seeing a flickering , listeners ! and this flickering is becoming a – a shape ! and the shape ... the shape is becoming ... a woman ! dana : hello , cecil ! it ' s me , dana ! cecil : dana ! why have not you returned to night vale ? dana : i will soon , i think . but there is something here that has me worried . that rumbling is getting louder , and the light on the horizon is quite close . i can feel heat , but i am not warm . the more the heat grows , the colder i feel . it is a terrible light and it is so close now . i feel as though the universe is unravelling . plus , i found someone here in the desert ! carlos : hi , cecil ! i am manifesting myself in your radio station for both personal and not-personal reasons . cecil : carlos ! oh ! thank the imperfect heavens ! i– i have not seen you in weeks ! i– i did not know where you had gone ! carlos : so , when i entered the house that does not exist , i found myself in this other desert world , but something happened to my team of scientists , and there was no one to let me back out ! then i c– could not even find the door . eventually , your friend dana found me ... cecil : now , carlos ? why did you not call ? or snapchat ? or reblog any of my woodcarvings of khoshekh ? i worked really hard on those . carlos : cecil ! how would i do that ? i ' m in the middle of a desert that is not of this world ! cecil : oh . carlos : there ' s no cell towers or wife or any kind of communication system . plus , i have to save my battery until i can find my way back to you – dana : oh no , no ! your phone totally works here ! carlos : really ? dana : yeah ! also , i have not charged my phone in , like , a year , the battery never ran down . cecil : oh . carlos : is that a samson ? dana : no ... no , same one you ' ve got . carlos : oh . wo w . dana : and the wife is pretty decent too , just ... carlos : oh , look at that ! cecil , i ' m on your tumblr right now ! and i got ta say , the art work is amazing . cecil : oh , thank you ! dana : i mean , time is pretty missed up , so sometimes you reply to e mails before they ' re even sent to you , but other than that ... cecil : carlos ? how do i get you home ? do da – dana ! how do we get carlos home ? i– i– i would like carlos to come home . carlos : i ' ll be able to very soon . i am working on inventing something right now . dana : cecil , every time the doors are open it lets that terrible light into night vale . and the light is so close now we ca not risk it ! carlos : right ! you ' re very smart . cecil , you have very smart interns . cecil : i know . carlos : so ... i'm– i ' m building a highly scientific device to keep the light away from the doors . now , the device looks a lot like a big umbrella . ‘ ka y ? but it ' s way more complex and scientific than that for reasons i do not have time to explain right now . my danger met er is in the red and , scientific ally speaking , red is the most dangerous color . cecil : carlos ? carlos , you ' re fading ! dana ! where did carlos go ? dana : he ' s still here ! carlos : dana ? i ca not see cecil anymore . dana : he ' s still here . carlos , thank you . i may get to see my mother and my brother again because of you . you are a hero . carlos : i ' m not a hero . i ' m a scientist ! dana : well , then ` ` scientist '' will always be my word for hero . cecil : what is he saying ? i canst carlos : we should go . uh , tell cecil we wo not be long at all . the – the doors should be safe to open now , i just need to finish stabilizing the device . dana : cecil ? we have work to do but we will be home soon . cecil : ok . i can not wait to see both of you . carlos : like , an hour or two , max . cecil : did – did he say something ? was it – was it cut e ? inter dana : goodby , cecil . cecil : ok . it is good to know we have such a talented former inter and ... a brilliant scientist working together . once again , listeners , um , i ' m also getting several frantic phone calls , uh , that have reminded me it is also election day ! so , let ' s check in at the alley behind city hall ! um , hiram ? careless old woman ? hiram mcdaniels ' green head : your revolution is meaningless ! i will burn all detractors ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : yeah , cecil , all of us are in agreement here . me , my green head there , and them other three heads . hiram mcdaniels ' gray head : oh , sure , just lump us all together as ` ` the other three .

'' dana : stay safe , night vale ! stay indoors and we will broadcast to let you know when it ' s all over . tamika lynn : get out there , night vale ! grab anything you can and fight ! grab a slingshot and a book , say an amy bend er short story collection , or millard panic ' s dictionary of the khazars . or , if not a book , grab a rock . or the throwing stars that come standard in most issues of mcsweeney ' s . grab anything you can , and fight ! do not believe in heroes , believe in citizens . be a citizen . cecil : dana , i– i– i know that you have planned this well , and you are incredibly smart , but ... dana : alright , it ' s fine . cecil : i think tamika ... dana : whatever . cecil : ... might be right . dana : not a big deal . cecil : um , no , i– i think we have to ... dana : i just brought two different armies together , whatever . cecil : ... all do this together , and let us not repeat our sin ... dana : it ' s fine . cecil : ... of inaction , i mean ... ugh . it – it has grown so bright , and i can not see much . but what i can see is nearly transparent , and ... and i am forgetting . and everything is coming apart , and i can see the great glowing coils of the universe unwinding . night vale , our time ... our time is now ! let us raise our fists and shout ! i can ... i can almost hear it . i can almost hear a crowd shouting , ` ` take down strex ! '' i can almost hear that crowd , but i can not quite hear them . they need to raise their hands and shout it louder ! they need to shout , ` ` take down strex ! '' every single one of them ! take ! down ! strex ! louder ! take ! down ! strex ! and they scream it ! take ! down ! strex ! and then , they stop . not because they do not care , but because they are people that are far away and not part of this story . they are part of a different story , a different fiction . but , realizing this , they all shrug and sadly murmur to each other , ` ` take down strex ? take down strex ? yeah , take down strex . '' and then , then they are quiet . and they hope for that ra rest element of all . they hope for the best . but in this story , in this fiction , i– i hear the sound of night vale fighting back . and as the light of this smiling god grows brighter , and as the shouts of this defiant night vale grow louder , and as i reach for my own personal copy of kate chop in ' s the awakening ( well , more specifically for the tear gas canister that came attached to the hardtack edition ) , i take all of you , all of us , that are fighting , all of us , together , all of us , all of us , to the weather . cecil , recorded : hi , you ' ve reached the voicemail of cecil palmer . i ' m off doing some important journalistic work . or maybe just petting khoshekh . but either way , leave me a message . carlos : cecil , hey . um , it ' s carlos . i– i– i hate that i got your voicemail , but listen , i figured it out . so , we ca not shut the oak doors unless everyone is back where they belong . and every moment those doors are open , more of that light gets through into night vale . i could not figure out why we could not just keep the doors closed for good , and it was really frustration to have a problem i could not solve . and then i got sad , because i could not solve it . but then i did solve it , and i felt so happy ! so those are some – but not all – of the emotions that i had . here is what i found . night vale is a place that is difficult to leave , and difficult to enter , and connecting a place as weird as that with a place as weird as this was causing a lot of ... strain ion linear time and space . so ... those native to night vale , dana , john , the angry woman in the inter shirt , all had to return home , and the masked army all had to come back here , which they did . just moments ago , the last of them came back through the door . it is so exciting when you make a scientific discovery like that ! i was very happy ! but then , as the last of the masked army members came through the door , it slammed shut and vanished . and i remembered that i am not from night vale . i remembered that , as far as the laws of the universe are concerned , it is not where i belong . cecil , i do not even remember how i got to night vale in the first place . i mean , where is night vale , even ? but i promise i will find a way back . it ' ll just take a couple of days , a week max . i ' ll be fine . i ' m a scientist . cecil ? a scientist is usually fine . maybe a few weeks , i do not know . the upside is dana was right . i have had 97 % battery all day , and decent reception ! so we ' ll at least get to talk every night . best of luck at home . i love you . cecil : listeners ? night vale fought together ! every citizen ! high school football coach , nazr al-mujaheed , in response to the strex workers ghastly smiles , showed them that thing that he can do with his tongue , which made many of them stop smiling and run screaming away . a balaclava-clad man wearing a mitre , cloak , and a giant silver star and speaking through a vocoder – you know , the man that we all believe to be the sheriff of night vale – was dropping heavy bricks down on the invaders from his hover-office in the clouds . simone rigadeau , the transient who lives in the earth sciences building at the community college , found some experimental fish in the lab closet , and put them into the fuel tanks of the yellow helicopter , which were already incapacitated by several plastic bags that had blown out of the forbidden dog park , and then , you know , wrapped themselves up in the rotors . and old woman josie , and her supposed ` ` angel '' friends , protected the empty lot where she plans to rebuild night vale ' s old opera house . the strex attacker were picked up by her winged friends and flown far into the sky , higher than even the sheriff ' s hover-office . and , of course , a group of teenager , led by tamika lynn , chased out everyone at strexcorp headquarters by slingshotting copies of stephen covey ' s best selling self-help book , 7 habits of highly effective people . and the civilization of tiny people living below lane 5 of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex ... well , they did something . i'm– i ' m not terribly sure , but , you know , ‘ cause they ' re too tiny to be noticed amid all the action . which is to say , strex has retreated ! and the blood-covered office workers are gone ! and ! and the old oak doors , they are also gone . and with them , that penetrating , vicious light , and we are safely in darkness once again . a very wealthy-looking and mostly nude being named erika , who introduced themselves as ... you know , an angel , or whatever , then wrote a check to purchase strexcorp . and , while they are not technically for sale , there was no one to decline the offer , so – according to american business law – that is a legal acquisition ! it is not yet known what the angels will do with the vast corporation they now own , and i think – at last – we are ourselves . we are night vale once again . even here , at the station , the office of station management now is just a stone slab covering a dark cave . a pulling red glow around its edges filling my mind with sad and monstrous visions when i walk past the door . so it seems like our old management is back in charge ! and that is ... well , i think that ' s a good thing . i think . i mean , it ' s possible that that is , in fact , terrifying news , so ... i think ... i guess ... we won ! careless old woman : speaking of winning ... cecil : yes ! right ! the election ! okay . well , it looks like we did not quite get all of the votes in yet , so we are going to speed things up . listeners ? listeners , wherever you are listening to this , just follow along . when i say the name of the candidate you prefer , raise your hand . so , i will say the name , you raise your hand , and the camera that are everywhere in town , watching your every move , will count your vote . so , raise your hand to vote for hiram mcdaniels . hiram mcdaniels ' gray head : oooooooh , i thought there would be more . do they not like me ? hiram mcdaniels ' green head : raise your hands for me ! or i will relieve you of the burden of having hands ! hiram mcdaniels ' blue head : up ! cecil : all right . ok . hands down . now , raise your hand for the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . careless old woman : i– i am in your home at this very moment . i am , in a way , your guest . it would be rude , as a host , if you did not raise your hand for me while i was sitting right there , unseen , next to you . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : now , now , now ... careless old woman : it might make me angry . i ' ve never been angry . i wonder what i ' m like when i ' m angry ? it will be interesting for us to find out together if you do not raise your hand for me . cecil : oh , ok . ok . great . hands down . now , i am fairly certain that some of you voted for both . and thus , negated yourselves . you ' ll know if one of your friends did this , because they will soon fade from existence forever . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : y up , very good . cecil : anyway , that ' s all the votes in but , of course , none of the votes matter because the election is decided by the pulses coming from hidden gorge . i am now being handed the results by an election official in full uniform – a plague doctor mask , an off-brand snuggie , and stilts . and the next mayor of night vale is ... hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : i just wan na thank every person who voted for me . you ' re all winners in my book ! hiram mcdaniels ' blue head : and we ' ve recorded all of your names right here in this book . careless old woman : i just ate one of your highlighters . i ' m sorry . i ' m nervous . i ' ll replace it with a crow ' s feather just as soon as i am mayor . cecil : oh . well , it says here that the next mayor of night vale is dana cardinal ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : ugh ... heh . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : i–i–i–i–i ' m sorry , cecil , cecil , i do not want to get obnoxious about this , but it ' s pronounced ` ` hiram . '' that was not even close . cecil : i– i know , i– i ' m sorry , this must be a disappointment to you both , but i– i ' m just reading what the gorge is secreting . careless old woman : your former inter dana ? but ... she was not even a candidate ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : yeah , na – oh . careless old woman : and she ' s so ... young and not ancient ! cecil : well , dana , the inter who came home , it is – like i told you once – you were always important – hiram mcdaniels ' green head : this is unacceptable ! prepare to burn ! cecil : you were always somebody , and now age has uncovered the you that was always ... hiram mcdaniels ' green head : rrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! cecil : ok . hiram ? please . i'm– i'm– i ' m in the middle of doing something right now . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : sorry ‘ bout him . cecil : it ' s the you that – no , it ' s the you that always was , but ... i ca not remember what i said . careless old woman : she ca not be mayor ! she is a murderer ! she killed her own double ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : well , now , now , now , i do not know if ` ` murder '' should necessarily disqualify someone from being ... hiram mcdaniels ' blue head : irrelevant . there is a 50 % chance that the victim was dana original and not dana double . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : oh yeah , thanks , blue . forget that other thing i was saying about murder . she has no proof that she is not a double of herself . cecil : that ' s right , there ' s no proof of ... careless old woman : everybody knows that being a double is one of the few manifestations of reality that can not be night vale mayor ! i do not accept these results . i am continuing my campaign , and i will make sure that dana does not stay mayor for long . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : and i find myself agreeing with the careless old woman . we will not rest until one of us is frightfully mayor . hiram mcdaniels ' green head : or until night vale burns to ashes and fumes ! hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : exactly , green , yes . exactly that . cecil : now , i really must object to all of this . careless old woman : come , hiram . you and i have planning to do . hiram mcdaniels ' gold head : yeah . cecil : well . once again , it ' s just you and me , listeners . the bustle of this day has come and gone . and now , there is the quiet night . the universe is unravelling . it still is . we won the day . we won the battle . we won whatever unit of measurement you care to say that we won . we returned to the dangerous equilibrium we had before , which we can only assume , or hope , or wish is better . but , of course , we did not stop the unravelling of the universe . the universe is not a thing that is , it is not a thing at all . it is the very action of its going . it is , in fact , its own dissolved and our lives – the entire span of human existence going back and back and , if we are lucky , forward and forward – the entire span is spent within this dissolve . so look at the fleeting stars with fleeting eyes , and feel how the earth beneath you gives . it is all a temporary manifestation of particles , and it is all unravelling back to articulate silence . the bustle of the human day will come and will go . and then there will be night . but how beautiful these moments within the dissolve ! what a temporary perfection we can find within this passing world ! everything good ever done ! everything good that was done today , and all the good people doing it , and back and back and forward and forward , all of that beauty within a universe unravelling . be proud of your place in the cosmos . it is small , and yet it is . how unlikely ! how fantastic ! and stupid . and excellent . and ... i ' m sorry . i– i ' m sorry , um , it looks like i have a voicemail from carlos . he must have called during the weather . um , i apologize , listeners , i– i have to check this , so ... stay tuned next for more of us and more of me , until that inevitable distant point where i and this and everything must end . and as always ... good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : wonderwall is the only '90s song visible from space .
WTNV|Capital Campaign|15 July 2014|home is where the heart is . we found it one day in the sink . it hum s things late at night , but they are not songs.welcome to night vale . if there ' s one thing i ' ve learned as a proud citizen of night vale , it ' s that horses are incredibly susceptible to suggestions from government satellites . but i ' ve also learned that night vale is a community that cares about education . night vale is a community that fears education . night vale is a community that allows education to happen the way terrified capers allow bears to eat their food . ` ` education is important , '' say whispers with no obvious source we all hear every night.college granulation rates in our little town are above the national average . we bravely continue to promote literacy in spite of the terrible dangers associated with books . our trance rates have significantly declined , due to the sheriff ' s secret police ' s program of humane , low-fatality taserings.so , i know we can count on all of you to support the night vale community college capital campaign , which was launched this past monday to fund the establishment of a new science center for students.science , i especially believe , is very important.college president sarah sultan announced , ` ` in our present , rapidly changing technological environment , it is more important than ever to encourage students to consider study and careers in all the sciences . except astronomy , '' she added , pretending she was coughing . ` ` nobody cares about astronomy , '' she said , obviously under a cough.reporters stood quiet and confused about how president sultan could make such an announcement , as she is a smooth , fist-sized river rock , and has no visible mouth , and likely no internal organs , muscles , or passageways that can create a human-sounding voice . ` ` telephathy , '' president sultan said with a cough . ` ` it ' s telepathy , you guy s , '' she said in all of our minds.fundraising opportunities like these can make a huge different to small local colleges . so please , night vale , consider making a contributions always , you can give to the capital campaign by burying your check , cash , or credit card donation in warm , wet earth , and whispering ` ` i know what you did ! i do not forget ! ` ` i ' ve gotten a lot of calls , e mails , telegram , and sympathetic glances the past couple of weeks , from people who are wondering if carlos the scientist has returned from the other world desert he is t rapped in . and here i remind you that he became t rapped there while saving our city from treacherous dark forces . i remind you he is a hero . i remind you that my boyfriend is a hero.sadly , carlos is still in the desert – the same desert our new mayor was once t rapped in . fortunately , as dana discovered , cell phone batteries last forever there , and there ' s pretty good wife , despite there being just vast amounts of sand and ... apparently , a mountain . but if our mayor can make it out fine , i think a scientist can too . scientists are always fine.listeners ? i ' ve been seeing all the reviews for that new restaurant , tourniquet . sounds like executive chef lashawn mason has created a real urinary hit ! it ' s almost impossible to get a reservation there . i tried to get a table for ... for just one , of course , and the nearest available date was not for another two months ! and even then , it was not a reservation for tourniquet , but for apple bee ' s . actually , you know what ? i think i ' ve been looking at the apple bee ' s webster . it ' s very easy to misspelled tourniquet . anyway.gia samuel ' review in the latest issue of the night vale daily journal mentioned tourniquet sous chef earl harlan , and that surprised me . he was a childhood friend of mine , and i had no idea he was a professional chef ! it also surprised me because he was dragged away screaming by the herd of mute children at last year ' s eternal scout ceremonies . very few ever survive boy scout courts of honor – especially not those dragged away by the mute children – so it ' s good to see earl back home and safe , and likely returning to his volunteer duties as scoutmaster ! i hope , one day , i can get a reservation to his fine restaurant.umm , let me see ... no pe , nothing . oh ! wait ! yes ! yes ! i got one ! i– oh . no pe . no , i ' m on the apple bee ' s webster again . nevermind.an update on the progress of the night vale community college capital campaign : thanks to the generous donations of night vale citizens , the campaign has already reached 30 % of its target goal . a particularly notable gift was made by local eccentric because and proud alum na , mrs sylvis wickersham . the college fundraising staff was caught off guard by this donation , as no one has heard from or seen mrs wickersham in over a decade . also , the gift was a fine porcelain vase , filled with two dozen english angora rabbits.college representatives expressed their gratitude for mrs wickersham ' s generous and super-cute contribution , of course , but would like to remind the greater community that it is preferred that donations be made via cash , check , credit card , spinal columns , or other common negotiate currencies . ` ` money , '' college representatives added helpful , through the narrow crack of a slightly-lifted man hole cover on main street . ` ` you know , the kind you use to procure goods and services when you still have a physical form , '' they added in spray-painted bubble graffiti on the side of an abandoned warehouse near the train tracks.more on this as there is more on this.night vale , our new leader is almost here ! this friday is inauguration day for our new mayor , dana cardinal , who used to be an inter at this very radio station ! dana may in fact be the most successful inter this station has ever had . so few of our interns have ever gone on to do anything . important . gone on to do anything important.inauguration of new mayors includes a swearing in ceremony that takes place behind a think velvet curtain . the curtain is raised a few inches , and all the press and public are shown a few shuffling feet and hear loud , high-pitched shouts . they mayor al swearing in ceremony is the one point in night vale ' s political calendar where citizens may voice their opinions and beliefs without risking reprisal or imprisonment . they are , in fact , encouraged to shout even the most forbidden beliefs and thoughts during the ceremony – openly , and without fear.the event will take place in an disclosed location 200 miles from downtown night vale and will be exactly two minutes long.former mayor al candidates , the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home and hiram mcdaniels , who is literally a five-headed dragon , have both declared this a blotched election and are filing for a re count by shouting their complaints into the side of a canyon wall they think might be hidden gorge . no one can tell exactly where hidden gorge is , which is how it got its name : gorge.it does not matter . i ' m ecstatic for our new mayor ! it ' ll be weird having a former inter as a leader , but i just think she ' ll do a wonderful job ! congratulations , old young friend ! i ' ve just been informed that mrs sylvis wickersham has made another large donation to the night vale community college capital campaign , this one consisting of 1,000 live and extremely fluffy rabbits . the capital committee is beginning to have difficulty finding space on camp us to house her donations . what foliage existed on camp us has been immediately devoured . several of the botany program ' s greenhouse have been broken into and ransacked . and many of the rabbits have reportedly entered the student center , refusing to wait in line before ordering at the snack bar , and taking way more napkins than they need.in order to make the most of this impressive endowment , the capital committee is currently discussing the possibility of ... re-purposing some of the rabbits towards resident ' s life operations . english angora rabbits are well-known for their thick , soft , silky wool – so the college ' s student housing office feels this presents an opportunity to make new blankets and rugs and hats and blindfold for students , as well as winter cloaks for the coyote-faced advisers that lurk about the student programs office.representatives have attempted to contact mrs wickersham to discuss the possible redistribution of her generous gifts , bu without success . more curiously , when attempting to visit mrs wickersham ' s home , committee members were informed by her neighbors that they have never actually seen mrs wickersham , but they often have dreams of her . ` ` i mean , she never looks like herself , '' each of the neighbors stated . ` ` generally she appears as a covering green box that pulses with light , and her voice sounds like an oboe playing a whole note , but like , in the dream kind of way where i totally know it ' s her , '' they concluded.some committee members raised questions about how an incorporeal dream-being could donate wild animals , and also if maybe ... she could stop doing that . those members were quietly removed from the room by other committee membership any case , night vale , let us hold mrs wickersham in our thoughts – and of course , dreams – and hope for her safe return . or , possibly for an end to her rabbit donations . both would be nice , but ... let ' s not be greedy night vale ! we all take what we can get in this life , you know ? we take what we can get.ahh , bad news from the night vale community college , listeners . a donation of 5,000 english angora rabbits in the name of mrs sylvis wickersham have just arrived at the college ' s fundraising headquarters . it ' s uncertain how they found their way there , as said headquarters had already been re located to the underground emergency fundraiser-related disaster bunker , constructed in the 1970s by dr . er less bedermayer , the community college ' s all-time second-least popular president.as of last report , the rabbits have invaded and taken over control of fundraising headquarters – using dedicated telephone lines to make personal calls , uttering insensitive remarks about the body types of students and staff , and tilting the vending machines in clear violation of safety labeling.simone rigadeau , the transient who lives in the earth sciences building , says these are typical behavior for this breed of rabbit , and that she is not surprised . she also repeated her claim that the world ended more than 30 years ago , before grunting some french cuss words and disappearing into a small , round hole in the wall.the 6,800 rabbits – more rabbits now than students – are running am ok throughout camp us . they have disrupted lectures and shown flagrant dis respect for faculty , they have joined academic and social organizations , and are engaged in irresponsible drinking . there are even reports that these vulgar , cuddly rodent broke into the college president ' s office and licked viciously on president sultan for several minutes before her administrative assistant could free her.listeners , this is an urgent situation . these rabbits – well , all rabbits , really – are a menace , and they now have access to all the advantages of higher education . i advise you to lock your bookshelves , eat your diplomas , and place any vulnerable stones or rocks in your home on high inaccessible shelves . if you see a rabbit , do not attempt to engage it in debate on post-structuralism , semiotics , gender politics , or sporting events.even as i speak to you college officials and the sheriff ' s secret police are desperately searching for mrs wickersham , hoping top mitigate some of the damage that is being done hope they find her , night vale ! i hope that the rabbits do not find us ! i hope that we all find something – or someone – that can keep the light on a little longer against the endless pressing dark.and in the meantime , i take you now to the weather . we have received information that agents of the sheriff ' s secret police broke down the door to mrs sylvis wickersham ' s neo-victorian home on the east side of town . their search of the house found it completely empty and inhabited , with the exception of a small green tree liza rd running itself in the front parlor.the sheriff ' s secret police grabbed the liza rd and were on the verge of eating it , as none of them had had lunch that day – well , i mean ... some raisins and a few roasted almonds , but that ' s not really a full lunch , and wizards are a complete protein – but the capital campaign committee stopped them . ` ` this is mrs wickersham , '' said a committee member . ` ` this is mrs . wickersham ? '' said the secret policeperson . ` ` yes , '' the committee member said , explaining further that mrs wickersham was a ` ` high-level donor '' to the college . at certain levels , donors receive benefits like mug s , or to te bags , or names carved into blood stones . at higher levels , donors receive very special benefits , like being able to invade the dreams of their neighbors , or having all of their belongings taken from their home , or ... being transformed , permanently , into a tree liza rd . ` ` most of our benefactors choose a gilt , or skin , or chunkwalla , '' the committee member said , quoting from the college ' s own fundraising brochure as the liza rd form of mrs wickersham dangled and squirmed above the sheriff ' s secret policeperson ' s gaping purple mawr '' mrs . wickersham takes a lot of pride in her alma mater , '' the committee member explained , ` ` and she has donate so much to the college . none of it has ever been money , but she is a valued donor to the community , '' continued the committee member , as a brass band somewhere else in the world , and completely unrelated to this story , played eighth notes quickly , but softly . ` ` why did you make a big fuss about it and call us here ? '' said the secret policeperson . ` ` oh , that ? '' said the committee member , shrugging . ` ` it was just , uh ... good publicity for our capital campaign . ` ` the sheriff ' s secret police coax ed the tree liza rd into a comfortable vivarika filled with fresh reptile bark , wrote evidence on the side of it in charpie , and removed it to an disclosed location near the microwave in the secret police breakroom.in her absence , mrs wickersham ' s next-of-kin was found to legally be her dry cleaner , ben burn ham , who was amenable to the idea of retracting mrs wickersham ' s donation – more specifically , what he said was ` ` yeah , sure , whatever . what do i care ? all the colleges are just factories for little socialist roots these days anyway . beep-boop-beep-boop ! free health care for everybody ! beep-boop-beep-boop-beep-boop i ' m a root ! ` ` then he began to – without breaking eye contact – eat the plastic hanging bags on his desk , starting from the top and working his way down.the rabbits have been removed , and re-donated to the night vale petting z oo . this worked out well , since until today the night vale petting z oo has only ever ho used emaciated wolves . but now , thanks to mr . burn ham ' s donation ( on behalf of mrs wickersham ) of nearly 8,000 cuddly rabbits , those wolves will not be hungry again for months ! despite all interruption , the night vale community college capital campaign has actually surpassed it ' s disclosed goal , and construction of the science center is slated to begin this coming summer.the capital committee would like to extend its thanks to everyone who donate . a community that cares for education , after all , is a community that cares for its future – with all the fear and respect and awe that the future is due.knowledge may be terrible , but we can only prefer it to ignorance . light may be terrible , but we can only prefer it to the dark.stay tuned next for a reality that can not possibly match expectations.and as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : soccer is also commonly known as football , canadian baseball , american football , violent logging , and world war ii .
WTNV|Rumbling|1 August 2014|cecil : look ! up in the sky ! it ' s a bird ! it ' s a plane ! it ' s a cloud ! it ' s a moon ! also , some stars ! there are so many things in the sky ! welcome to night vale . new night vale mayor , and former inter at this very station , dana cardinal announced today that she wants to open the dog park for public use . said dana – or , i guess i should start saying mayor cardinal – ` ` dog park s should be used for dogs and owners to exercise and play . a dog park should be a fun gathering place for citizens to meet and socialize . not a secretive patch of municipal darkness full of conspiracy warning signs . '' only moments into her announcement , the city council entered the press room , walking in synchronously steps , hips together , teeth apart , blocking the view of reporter and photographer , and plugging the mayor ' s microphone . the council shuffled away to the council chambers , taking the mayor with them . twenty minutes later mayor cardinal emerged , wearing several large ivory rings and a long herculean cape . she announced that dogs are not allowed in the dog park . people are not allowed in the dog park . you may see hooded figures in the dog park – but not for long , as there are now plans to reinforce the fence around the dog park . oh , listeners ! guess who we ' ve got on the phone line now ? i ' ll give you a hint : he saved night vale a few weeks ago by shutting out a great terror trying to invade us from another world . carlos : it was not just me ! cecil : also , he ' s my boyfriend . and a scientist . and i miss him . carlos : i miss you , too . cecil : that ' s right ! my boyfriend is a hero . please welcome to our show , carlos the scientist . carlos : you ' re too much ! cecil : listeners , carlos had to stay behind in whatever strange desert other world , which was very brave of him , even though he ' s now very far away from people that love him . any luck getting back through to night vale ? carlos : not yet . oh ! but , i ' ve been exploring this strange rumbling noise here . it ' s the same rumbling noise we heard when that terrible light was coming into night vale . cecil : are you safe ? is everything ok ? carlos : actually , there it is again . when we shut the doors the rumbling and the unbearable bright light went away . this empty desert , with the mountain and the lighthorse and the large wandering army , all seemed so normal , you know ? but last night the rumbling returned . there it is again . i need to grab my instruments . cecil : i ... i ca not hear it ! carlos : i ' ll call you back . cecil : no ! no ! carlos , i ... ugh . every time . i never know when you ' ll call back . well , speaking of the town being safe , our neighboring town , desert bluff , ran a full-page ad in the sunday extra-large imagination edition of the night vale daily journal this week that said , i imagined , ` ` thank you for having us , night vale . best of luck in your future '' i ca not tell if that ' s an exclamation point or a question mark there . what a weird font ! it ' s like someone put paint , or some other thick liquid on the tip of a sharp finger and then hand wrote this ad . it ' s just like that . then , at the bottom , it has a photo of your face , dear listener ! and the same finger-painted letter ing that reads , ` ` blessings from a smiling god . '' wo w ! where did they get that photo of you ? although , honestly , it ' s not a bad photo ... i mean , you look just adorable when you ' re sleeping ! i know this farewell ad may seem like a kind gesture , but ... good radiance to those monsters ! no one is happier than me to see us run desert bluff out of town . meanwhile , there has been a lot of construction noise , like horns , see-saws , parrot shrieking , et cet era , from the old strexcorp headquarters at the lip of ra don canyon . several tall beings with wings , who all introduce themselves as erika , were seen hanging around outside while a sheriff ' s secret police representative ran frantically between onlookers , putting her hand over each person ' s eyes and shouting , ` ` you ' re not seeing anything real ! '' well i , for one , am excited to learn what these ... of course , completely non-existent angels plan to do with the huge malevolent corporation they purchased . oh ! also , i stopped by the office of station management . seems like our community radio station was purchased back from strexcorp by our original owners , whom i have never met – or seen – and who , until recently , had run this radio station for centuries . it ' s nice to have all these familiar faces back ! or ... not faces , more like muffled screams and chattering echoes and pulling orange lights surrounding dark stone doors that are never in the same place you remember them being . just a quick stroll past the new old boss ' office brought me back to the good old days , as i crumbled to the floor , struck numb and blind with flashes of hideous daydreams , a history ' s worth of deaths that were not my own . how great to be back to the way we were ! ah h , the good old days ! the fearful , terrible , deadly , good old days ! oh , my phone ' s buzzing ! carlos ? hello ? carlos , are you back on the line ? carlos : yes . so ... there ' s a lighthorse here in the desert . it ' s on top of a tall mountain , and there ' s a blinking red light on the top of this lighthorse , and this blinking red light always blinks , ok ? that ' s what it does . but now that the rumbling has returned ... can – can you hear the rumbling from your end , cecil ? cecil : no . carlos : it ' s very loud ! but when the rumbling happens , the blinking red light stops blinking . it just stays on . cecil : what do you think that means ? carlos : i do not know ! i ' ve talked with some of the army of men and women and others who roam about this desert , and they look frightened . they have never seen the blinking light stop blinking ! it is what a blinking light is supposed to do , and fear is what happens when a thing that has always behaved one way does not behave that way at all . they run and hide now when they hear the rumbling and see the static red light up on the mountain . i , too , am starting to feel scared . cecil : carlos ? remember how you got into that desert in the first place . you went through a door in a house that did not seem to exist . have you found any of those doors yet ? carlos : not yet , no . cecil : carlos ? look for those doors . there must be at least one left somewhere ! carlos : i ' ll start looking very soon , ok ? but listen , cecil ? i d really like to figure out this rumbling/red light thing . i ' m a scientist . i need to discover/understand things . it ' s what i do ! cecil : but ... could not you look for the door while you figure it out ? carlos : i ' ll look for the door some tomorrow . for sure i will . cecil : well , that ' s not what i was going to ... carlos : the rumbling ' s gone ! did you hear that ? carlos : i ' ve got to run . i need to find doug . cecil : who ' s doug ? wait , carlos , who ' s doug ? carlos ? ok . well , i guess let ' s just have a look at today ' s horoscopes . leo : need a penny , take a penny . have a penny ? take another penny ! pennies are worthless , but go ahead and take them all . build a great fortune only to have its great copper weight crush your lifeless pauper body . virgo : do not shoot the messenger , virgo ! it ' s noisy , and will alert others of your crime . lure the messenger inside . make sure no one saw him come in . choose something quieter than a gun . perhaps suffocation , or an accidental fall . really plan these things out . stop being so trigger happy , virgo ! libra : do you believe in ghosts ? you do not ? well , wo not you be surprised when you wake up in the middle of the night tonight ! scream loud enough so the neighbors can hear you . scorpio : you are respected by your peers . you are a great thinker and leader . you ... wait , what is this ? this is definitely not the right reading for a scorpio , it must be a type . i bet the stars meant to say : you should hear what they ' re saying about you . very funny things , scorpio ! they ' re saying very funny things at your expense , you jerk ! yep , that ' s definitely what the stars meant to say . sagittarius : the best revenge is living well . the second-best is tasteless slow-acting poison . maybe it ' s more of a tie . either way , you got wronged , and you need to set things right , sagittarius ! capricorn : ‘ tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all , which is better than to have never loved at all , but also somehow lost a love , thus creating a paradol . parades are bad , capricorn . be careful , or logic will destroy you . aquarium : your boyfriend is t rapped in an alternate desert dimension . it is difficult to say when he will return . perhaps take up drinking while crying in a quiet room . wo w ! that ' s a very specific and ... painful horoscope . thanks for nothing , stars ! pieces : a train leaves a station traveling west at 40 miles per hour . another train leaves a station traveling east at 60 miles per hour . these two trains left on different days , in different years , in different countries . how long until the passengers acknowledge their own impermanence ? aries : i think they saw you , aries . hold still . they can not see you if you do not move . shhhhhh ! do not move ! do not move ! don't– no pe , they saw you . so long , aries ! taurus : someone misses you a lot , taurus . and even though you have nothing but endless time t rapped out in a nightmarish desert hellscape , you have a hard time making a phone call longer than ten minutes . maybe call a bit more than you do , taurus ! yep , that ' s just some astrological advice from the stars . remind : you know those eight spiders a year you eat in your sleep ? well , they add up . they are all organizing a pretty dramatic escape . very soon , remind ! very soon ! cancer : ` ` the ocean is vast , '' you convince yourself , walking alone between the trees . ` ` the sky is endless , '' you mutter repeatedly , trying to finally lull yourself to sleep . ` ` matter can neither be created nor destroyed , '' you contemplate , despite not understanding the first part of the statement . ` ` what ' s on the food network tonight ? '' you say aloud to a stranger you have known for years . this has been today ' s horoscopes . ah ! he ' s calling in again ! carlos ? carlos : cecil , the rumbling has started again . the mountain is moving up and down , like ... breathing . there are creaks and groans in the earth , in the stones , that together sound like a growl , an undulating snarl of something much bigger than anything that should ever be able to snarl . cecil , this is a strange place , and considering where i ' ve lived for the past couple years , that says a lot . i know dana used to be t rapped here and she has told you about it . i mean , i used to wonder how she could call and text you from this place for an entire year with no cell towers or power outlets , but i ' ve been here for weeks and i have three bars ( only g , but still ) , and 97 % battery , which was the charge i had when i came through the door in the house that does not exist . in a temporary peace between the rumblings , i walked with some of the desert army toward a small patch of discoloured sand . we found a swash of damp dirt , just a handful of red mud , and in that mud were several tiny white bones . looked like long legs and short wings of a creature i ca not even imagine ! i look forward to figuring out exactly what this is . i ' ll be able to imagine it then ! cecil : carlos , i do not think it ' s safe there ! listen , i want you to find a way to – carlos : cecil ? nothing and nowhere is safe . but there are things greater than us . greater than all of this ( so , you ca not see it , but i just made a big sweeping hand gesture to indicate everything in the universe ) , and there are people who must learn about it all . how it all works , and why . this is what we call science ! cecil : yes , i know what science is . carlos : and i am a scientist . cecil : ok , i understand . ugh . it ' s just ... it ' s just that i miss you , and – cecil : oh ! oh my ! the building is shaking ! carlos : you can feel it ? you can feel the rumbling ? ooh , this is exciting ! wait , this is new ! the ground is moving very quickly . there is a large lump churning the sound up and down , i ' m leaning out over this ledge to get a better view of this fantastic event , and ... .ow ! cecil : carlos ! what happened ? carlos : i got hit . what is that ? is that a rock ? own ! cecil : carlos ! carlos : cecil , the rocks are coming down . they ' re coming down the side of this hill . i need to take cover , i need to find a– cecil : carlos . carlos ? listeners , while the earth still shakes , take shelter . this does not feel like one of our government-scheduled earthquakes , but if i were you i would still do as the earthquake safety ma scot , duncan the brown because spider , always says : ` ` i ' m small , and i hide a lot , so it ' s easy to be safe . '' and with that , i take you now to the weather . cecil : carlos , are you there ? carlos ? carlos : i ' m here . cecil : are you ok ? carlos : i ' m fine . a scientist is always fine . doug was really helpful ! cecil : who is doug ? carlos : he ' s one of the members of this great masked army . he must be a captain of some sort , given his size and the respect he appears to garner . as the rocks and boulders came down , doug picked up a large , flat stone and held it above us . the rocks bounced off his makeshift shield . unfortunately , i dropped my phone . i smashed the phone something good . i thought i lost you for a while there , cecil . i was despairing that my one way to reach you would be lost for who knows how long . but then , you know what ? something really amazing happened ! something tremendous ! the phone healed itself ! cecil : oh ! that ' s ... that ' s great ! carlos : it is great ! but phone do not just heal themselves . this is another scientific mystery i ca not wait to get to the bottom of . cecil : where is doug now ? carlos : oh , i do not know . he ' s probably back at the encampment . they ' re a nomadic army . sometimes they are here , sometimes not . i do not really have time to make new friends . they ' re nice people , but there is a lot of work for me to do here . and ... the only person i truly care about is not in this desert anyway . i do not know what the rumbling is . i do not know why some doors work and others do not . i do not know why my phone never loses battery power and can heal itself . i do not know how long it will take me to pursue this knowledge . but i do know two things . cecil : what is that ? carlos : i love you . cecil : i love you , too . what ' s the other thing ? carlos : you just said it . cecil ? i have to go . be patient with me . we have our phone . we have our voices , and you have the best voice of them all . cecil : thanks for being on the air with me . we did almost the entire show together ! carlos : we can still do things together , even in absence . i ' ll be back again soon . cecil : find that door , carlos ! carlos : i will . but first i need to see if the red light is blinking again or not . cecil : ok . bye , carlos . listeners , i wish i could tell you where the rumbling came from , and that we are safe from it . the sheriff ' s secret seismology team announced that today ' s rumbling , which caused quite a bit of structural damage and knocked out power for one third of the town , did not register at all on the richer scale , which is a thing seismologists use to assign two-dimensional numbers to complex multidimensional physical events . but the up shot is we are all alive for however many two-dimensional numbers we have left . stay tuned next for the sound of future becoming the present – becoming the past – in no time at all . and as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : everything that happens , happens for a reason . except ostrich . what the hell , man ?
WTNV|The Retirement of Pamela Winchell|15 August 2014|now is your chance . well , that was it . it ' s over . did you do it ? have you achieved what you wanted ? no ? aah , well . welcome to night vale . former mayor pamela mitchell called an emergency press conference today to announce that she is enjoying her retirement immensely , and she could not be happier to no longer be mayor . ` ` more happiness is not possible , '' she wailed . ` ` happiness is a fool ' s daydreams . '' she was then reminded by reporter that she is no longer mayor , and so should not be calling emergency press conference s , especially when there is none of the usual emergencies happening – like seeing an interesting butterfly , eating a very good sandwich , or being disappointed that it is 2:00 already . i sought a statement from current mayor dana cardinal who is , of course , a former inter and dear friend of mine . i found her at the end of a dark halfway , draped with rotting black cloth and thick with cobwebs , where she was sitting on the mayor al throne and contemplation her hands . ` ` i thought it would be different than this , '' she said . ` ` but it ' s exactly what it is . '' i asked her specifically her thoughts on former mayor pamela mitchell continuing to call emergency press conferences . ` ` oh ! '' mayor dana said . and then , again , ` ` oooh . '' and then , ` ` she can do that if she wants . i ' m too busy these days to do press conferences anyway . tell you what : '' and then , she did tell me what , which is that she is naming pamela mitchell the official night vale director of emergency press conferences . when informed of this news , pamela made a wiping , dismissive gesture with her hands , saying ` ` i do not need her permission . i ' ll call them if i want . anyway , i ' m retired . '' she was crying . she smiled , and she cried . ` ` i ' m retired , '' she continued , ` ` but that ' s very , very nice of her . what a wonderful woman . i ' m going to call an emergency press conference to let people know what a wonderful woman the new mayor is , '' she concluded . and now , a word from our sponsors : today ' s sponsor is the concept of itching . listeners , are you looking for an action that will pass the time , but also is mildly irritating ? searching for a way to have your body express reaction to material it is allergic to ? want to express confusion in the most stereotypical manner possible ? i am just thrilled to be here on behalf of itching . itching has been with humans as long as there has been humans . longer than that , even ! why , beings have been having to scratch themselves almost as long as they ' ve been being . it can be fun ! it mostly wo not be . but , if it ' s your thing , or if it ' s in a spot that ' s easy to reach , then it can sort of be fun ! i ' m not saying it will definitely be fun , it probably wo not be . the concept of itching . for a free sample , just think about it . oh ? there you go ! see ? your experiencing it right now ! this has been a word from our sponsors . pamela mitchell called an emergency press conference to announce that , while she thanks the current mayor for her generous offer , after some thought and discussion with a couple of helpful advisers , she simply is too busy being retired to accept . ` ` i ' m just too busy fishing , '' she said , wildly waving a fishing rod around , slapping it on her podium , and narrowly avoiding catching several reporter with the absurdly oversized hook , as they ducked and scrambled out of reach . ` ` see ? '' she continued . ` ` i ' m fishing right now ! this is what fishing looks like , i ' m pretty sure , '' she continued , cracking the thick , leather fishing line like in that popular and heartwarming series of adventure moves about a wisecracking archaeologist who comical ly destroys countless important artifacts under the hilarious misapprehension that they belong in his museum rather than in the religious sites of the cultures that made them . as the reporter ran from her dangerous , failing fishing line , she shouted , ` ` this concluded my emergency press conference about my complete retirement from emergency press conferences . please assemble again in three hours for an emergency press conference that will update you on my retirement status . '' she then took hold of a rope , dangling from the hastily-painted blue backdrop that we all assume is the sky , and was lifted up through a door , shaking the flimsy particle board known as ` ` the sky '' as she went . in other news , strexcorp synernists , inch , a company which , until recently , had something of an out sized effect on our town , is now under the control of beings who call themselves angels ... and who do not , legally , exist . the existence of the company itself is therefore something of a moral/ethical question , the kind that philosophers consider in their secret black market philosophy meetings . despite all the difficulties in discussing its very concept , strex and its new owners have gone about making what they say are constructive repairs to a town damaged by its recent battle with a force that seemed – but was not – greater than our own . for instance , they gave teddy williams , of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , the funds to hire contractors to renovate his building , and cover over lane 5 with shalt , thus trapping the tiny civilization beneath it that is still declaring war on us . a so-called angel said in a statement , ` ` i have donate a coffee table made of human bones to charity , and will use the money i save on taxes to invest in the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex because angels , if we were real , would certainly love to bowl . or whatever , '' the creature added . meanwhile , i ' ve been getting regular calls and snapchats from carlos – you know , my hero scientist boyfriend – from the desert otherworld he is very temporarily t rapped in . he ' ll be back super soon . he says that he found a cactus , only it ' s not a cactus , only it is . he says it ' s difficult to explain , and that he really wants to explain it . that is what he is for , he said , to explain a world that defies explanation . he sent me a photo of the cactus , but it only appeared on my phone as an error box that said , ` ` even if you could , you would wish you had not . '' well , it sounds like he ' s having fun out there ! that ' s ... that ' s good . pamela mitchell called another emergency press conference to show just how well she ' s doing without the need to call emergency press conferences . ` ` retirement is great ! '' she said . ` ` i ' ve taken up bird watching . '' she then showed off this new hobby ... in the process , demonstrating a deep misunderstanding of both the concept of birds , and the concept of watching . the resulting fire wiped out the podium and , indeed , the entire press conference gazed , sending both pamela and the attending reporter fleeing in every direction . ` ` see how wonderful being retired is ? '' she shouted behind her as she printed away , smoke-fueled tears streaming from her sunken eyes . ` ` i love being retired ! it ' s the best ! '' she concluded , as the fire spread to several nearby structures despite the earnest lectures and head-shaking from night vale ' s brigade of brave fire disapprovers . ohhh ! listeners ! i finally got a chance to eat at tourniquet , night vale ' s hottest new urinary night spot . i mean , i did not get to eat their food , or sit at any of their tables ... reservations are still just too hard to get . but i did make a pb & j at home , and eat it quickly in their front waiting area , as the maitre d ' glared at me implacable – as he does to everyone , due to the fact that he is a large idol carved from volcanic rock . but , despite the less-than-ideal visit to the restaurant , it did give me a chance to say hello again to earl harland . now , it was a big surprise for me . my childhood best friend , earl harland , working at this restaurant , after being dragged away by mute inter-dimensional children , not to be heard from again for a year and a half . it was a big surprise for me , obviously , because i had no idea he had any interest in cooking , let alone the skill to be a sous chef . well , i invited him to come on the show sometime , and give all of us a few cooking tips . i do not know if he ' ll take me up on it , but we might be lucky enough to get a peek into the mystical nearly-forgotten art that is cooking . wo not that be dangerous ! and probably illegal . despite pleas from local , regional , national , international , and interstellar authorities , pamela mitchell has continued to give emergency press conferences to publicity her deep enjoyment of retirement . and to decline the new mayor ' s standing job offer to give emergency press conferences . her press conference about tropical fish care resulted in a deadly flash flood that swept through old town night vale , washing away everyone ' s piles of cool stones they had found . her demonstration of coin collecting crashed several world economies ... in the process , breaking a ten year peace treaty that had ended the previous blood space war . and her demonstration of mass poisoning , unfortunately , went without a hit ch . even as her press conferences have become much more fatal than usual , she has increased their frequency considerably , sometimes having two press conferences so close together that they actually occur simultaneously , pamela speaking in a rapid back and forth to two different groups of reporter , as she shows two different cataclysmic methods of retirement she has recently been taught by her mysterious team of advisers . more on this story as pamela continues to create it . and now , some life hacks that will allow you to par se and program the code of life – thus changing the very fabric of your being in a clumsy and likely horrify ing fashion . also , a handy way of organizing your entire existence through a complex system of binder clips and toilet paper rolls . let ' s get started ! life hack one is ... oh ! u mm , listeners , inter maureen is waving to me frantically from the control room – well , more frantically than she does at all times about the general terrifying nature of life – and she ' s mouth ing something ... flannel fish er ? animals whiz beer ? oh ! oh ! no . she ' s mouth ing ` ` pamela is here ! '' listeners , it seems that pamela mitchell , her press conference gazed burned down , has chosen the steps of the community radio station as the site of her next retirement demonstration . given the affect of her previous demonstrations , this could spell doom for our little station and our little lives . i must ... i must try to talk to her . i will , listeners , i will make her listen . and while i make her listen , i will also make you listen to the weather . now , pamela ? pamela ! stop ! well , we have returned , as we always do ! all of us . unless we do not , as we sometimes do not . all of us . many people who have had night vale community radio mean something in their lives rushed to the front steps of the building to save this vital part of our little town . the crowd held most of the population of our beloved burg . in this modern age of media there is , of course , no medium so close to the common heart as community radio . leading the crowd was mayor dana , who pressed ms mitchell further to accept her offer of the official position . but pamela was swayed . she , in fact , was standing rigidly , her eyes rolled to the whites , her fingers played , booming ` ` retirement ! retirement ! '' in a voice that was not her own . a great wind gust ed up from around her body , whirling through the crowd and sweeping inter maureen away into the distance . to the family and friends of inter maureen , et cet era . anyway . ` ` pamela ! '' we cried , unified under threat , just as we are often at odds through peace , ` ` pamela ! do not retire ! we need you ! '' we cried . ` ` specifically , we need you to stop demonstrating your retirement ! stop doing that right away ! '' we said in unison and in fear . but pamela would not hear us . we had given up all hope , and were casting about for other things to give up : dreams , aspirations , and then , digging further , anticipated muscle pains – pre-grief for loss that had not happened yet , post-grief for losses long ago – and further still , until we were ready to give up that shifting , shiver spark that is our human heart itself . but then ... but then ... well , i do not remember what happened next . there seems to be just a gap in my memory , much longer and deeper than the usual gaps that we all develop in our memories to protect us from forbidden information we might have heard , or hooded figures we might have accidentally brushed against in the dark of our rooms just before we turn on the lights . but fortunately , being a reporter , i had my little reporter ' s book of big-boy note taking , just like i ' ve had since i was five years old , and the prophesied were first revealed that i was destined to be the voice of our little community . i always make notes in this book , even if i ' m not aware of it . see ? just now i wrote down , ` ` said : always makes notes in this book , even if i ' m not aware of it . '' wo w ! very accurate , and i ' m not even holding a pen ! anyway , i can just consult my notes and see how this situation was solved . u mm , ok . it appears here that a man in a ta n jacket holding a bearskin suitcase approached pamela ' s podium . ` ` fear not ! '' he said , perhaps a ta d melodramatically . ` ` i can relate to what she ' s going through , '' he continued . ` ` i think i can talk her through this . '' ` ` you look very familiar , '' we all shouted back , still in unison . ` ` but i do not believe we ' ve ever met you before . who are you ? '' but the man in the ta n jacket was already glittering , spider-like , up to pamela , and whispering into her ear . no one could hear what he said , according to my notes , but pamela seemed to immediately respond to his voice , stopping the mass destruction of her retirement activities and listening intently , occasionally nodding and saying ` ` uh-huh . uh-huh . ahahah ! '' and then , miracle of miracles , she stepped away from the podium . ` ` mayor cardinal , '' she said , ` ` i would be happy to accept the role of director of emergency press conferences . thank you , and i am no longer retired . '' she then asked everyone to meet her tomorrow at 7:00am sharp in the newly-rebuilt press conference gazed , for her first official emergency press conference in that role . as for the mysterious man , he of the ta n jacket and bearskin suitcase , he turned to the audience , and started a lecture about the place he is from , frequently naming it , and even pointing to it on a map . but any time the name of the place should appear in my notes , the writing has been violently scratched out to the point of tearing through the paper . and then , just blank pages , until a few minutes ago when my notes resume . so ... that ' s what happened . or , at least , according to my notes . it ' s entirely possible that during that memory gap , i decided to use my notebook to try out a first fo ray into realistic fiction , and that something else entirely happened . who knows which fiction al version of the fiction al past is true ? and so , listeners , now that we are safe , let us take a moment of deep sympathy for pamela mitchell . one of the great fears among a life of great fears , perhaps the last great fear is the fear of being no longer useful . we find a role in life , and we do that role to the best of our ability for as long as that ability is there . but all of us – even me , dear listeners – will someday hit a point where we no longer are able to do that thing that we define ourselves by doing . and more than the fear of injury , more than the fear of death , this is the fear that loom s . the loss of self . the self that is self we imagined we were our whole lives . but we were never that self , not really . we were only a series of serves , living one role and then leaving it for another . and all the time convincing ourselves that there was no change . that we were always the same person , living the same life . one arc to a finish , not the stutter-stop improvisations that is our actual lives . worry less about the person you once were . or the person you dream you someday will be . worry about the person you are now . or do not even worry ! just be that person . be the best version of that person you can be . be a better version than any of the other versions in any of the many parallel universe . check regularly online to see the ran kings . pamela mitchell was mayor . and now , she is not . but that does not mean she is not anything . she is still pamela . she is still a human being . and now , she is also the director of emergency press conferences . we look forward to the pamela that is , and whatever pamela will come after . stay tuned next for a world so possible that its very possibility feels constricting . and of course , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : most people think pit bulls are dangerous dogs , but – biological speaking – most pit bulls are just three ship thus wearing a trenchcoat .
WTNV|The September Monologues|1 September 2014|cecil : the wind out of the desert is changing . i feel it . you feel it . a shiver in the midday heat . a crackle in the television broadcast . a shift in your immune system . it is september , and something is different . it is september , and the days have gone sinister – from first eye ' s open to last slow breathing . it is september , and so , listeners – dear listeners – night vale public radio is proud to introduce the september monologue . careless old woman : chad ? can you hear me ? my mouth is half an inch from your left ear and i ' m whispering . you will feel a heavy warmth there , like air from the swamp . that means i ' m talking to you , chad . i ' m right behind you . listen , chad ... how long have we lived together ? your whole life , that ' s the answer . not that you d know it , because i do it secretly . that ' s my name : the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . though , also , i do not have a face . chad , i am getting away from the point . you are the point . is this how you want to live your life ? shuffling from one trivial moment to the next , never letting anything add up to anything else ? chad , it ' s not my place to say , i know . my place is hiding behind the boring button-up shirts in your closet , my thin , gnarled fingers almost brushing your hand each time you reach for one of those milquetoast frocks on your way to another unsuccessful night trying to find someone who will make you more than you are . chad , do you know how many flies live in your apartment ? i do . i know all of their names , and i tell them where to lay their eggs . so listen , chad , do not get on my wrong side . my fury is vast , and murky , and expressed through a papier-mâché gape-mouthed that i left behind your cereal boxes this morning . not that you ' ll find it . you never eat breakfast . a good breakfast is the start of a good day , say the tablets we found in that ancient crater last year . but i ' m not here to lecture you , chad . i ' m here to understand . like , what ' s with all the candles ? your room is strewn with clothes like your dresser got sick from operating , but suddenly you ' re buying nicely-scented candles , and arranging them carefully in the living room ? that does not seem like you , chad . and the fabric . that rich , red fabric that you bought and ... are you sewing that fabric , chad ? that does not seem like you either . your other hobbies involve watching or consuming and now , here you are , doing ! what does it mean ? i ' ve uncovered many secrets , chad . do not think that you are going to be able to keep anything from me . i know what is behind the old vs copy of cliffhanger in your media center . i know about the way you talk to your horse figures . yes , i know about the horse figures . and i know about the dreams , chad . i put my careless head very close to your face at night as you sleep . if you opened your eyes , i ' m sure it would upset you . so fragile , and yet so certain – your belief in the sanctity and privacy of home . oh , what about the amulet you hid in the bag of lecture deep in your fridge ? why the amulet , that ancient cracked painting of a screaming goat set upon gold and bony ? i could not lift it , chad . i tried with my bony , skin-taut arms that have a surprising animal strength . those arms that have been so close to you so many times , but that you ' ve never seen . i tried to lift it , chad , and i could not . why was not i able to lift it ? this is me , as a part of your life , trying to understand that life . and you , drinking beer with your friends , drinking beer by yourself , drinking beer before work by yourself , smiling with your friends and smiling at your work and sitting dead-eyed and silent for hours inside your living room , wearing a po lo shirt and khaki shorts , crying without making a sound or moving . a silence of tears down your slack , boyish face . chad , this is you , and i ' m trying to understand . i ' ve stopped googling bees and i ' ve started googling your name over and over . i ca not find a trace of you anywhere . what are you , chad ? i thought i understood . i do not understand . and now , you are rising from your easy chair , still weeping . you are putting on a long red robe and lighting the candles arranged through the room in a pattern or a shape that i do not recognize . you are raising up the amulet and you are speaking ... no , shouting , no ... intending . this is not a language i understand ! i understand every language . your very speech is outside of my reality . what i saw next , chad , was beyond me . i have seen death in its many heaving forms . i have seen the low-flying ships that hide on the horizon in front of the setting sun , and i have seen the misshapen silhouettes of their pilots . i have seen the webster you visit . but chad ... what i saw in that moment , what you summoned in your living room , what you brought to us here in this little town , my town , the town i secretly live in , the town in which i am , at least in my view , presumptive mayor ... what have you done ? chad , this is all to say that i am the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home , but ... not your home , chad . not anymore . because something else is living there now . oh , chad . something else is living there now . cecil : the air is different . or ... no . it is the way we are breathing that is different . the breathes , all of us , have changed . we ' ve gone funny , you know , just ... funny . words ca not capture it . but i have only words . so , up next , more words . after that , words . words , and words , and words . words that form the september monologue . michelle nguyen : nobody ' s made a good album in years ! ` ` michelle , '' you say , ` ` michelle nguyen , that ' s not true ! '' well , you ' re right . very little of what i have to say is true . some of it is , though . make of that what you will . no , do not . i do not trust you to make anything good . hang on , there ' s a customer . welcome to dark owl records ! you ! you ! why are you here ? what do you want from me , you – never mind , they left . we sold a pretty decent record the other day . it was a beach boys album . everyone thinks the beach boys are the best . and fine , fine , they contributed a lot to american music . you can hear their influence on people like co le porter , and join mitchell , and mozart , but i ' m so sick of everybody thinking they know music just because they buy a beach boys album ! i begged the guy not to buy it . it was , of course , the one with most of their big hits on it , like ` ` the people under the floor , '' and ` ` i ' m being followed , '' and ` ` track ing device inside my skin , '' and no doubt the beach boys ' most famous song , ` ` hand me that hammer , madame dentist . '' he bought the album anyway , but i broke it into pieces as i handed it to him , and then i told him the store was closed and he was not allowed to leave . he ' s still somewhere in the basement . a couple people came looking for him , but i covered my eyes with my hand and sat silently so they could not see me . point being , there are still a few good albums in the world , but not many . oh ! you know what i ordered for the store last week ? it should arrive any day . if you ' re a true lover of folk music , you ' ll be just as excited as i am for this . i ordered 25 copies of wood guthrie . they ' re scale replicas of his body in his most recognizable pose : holding a guitar in one hand and an aquarium full of mice in his other two hands . these replicas are 3:1 scale , so there ' s no room with our low ceilings . i ' ll have to keep them outside of the store in people ' s laws and next to highway overpasses and such . but they ' re just great ! oh , wait . never mind . folk music is over . it ' s done , came and went . stop listening to folk music ! the guthrie replicas are now 70 % off . please do not buy them , though . folk music is dead . you want to know what music i ' m listening to right now ? joy division . not ` ` unknown pleasures . '' everyone ' s listened to that album . that album will never be talked about by me again . no . i ' m listening to a different joy division album . it ' s a pretty recent album that was never actually released , because they never wrote it or recorded it or produced it . but i managed to get a copy of this album , and i listen to it almost daily . in private , so it ' s not ruined by other people having heard it or talked to me about it . it ' s a good album . i cry when i hear it . i cry when i think about it . i ' m crying now . i ' m sure it does not sound to you like i ' m crying , because you ca not comprehend my crying . you ca not see me or hear me crying because you do not know me . you do not truly know me . this joy division album truly knows me in a way no other human ever has . and so , that ' s a complete list of music i like . looks like the coroner is here again . hello , linda ! we got the new panic ! at the disco album in ! i ' ve been selling her blank cds for years now and telling her that ' s panic ! at the disco ' s aesthetic , that they just release completely silent songs with no titles on albums with no tracks or cover art and no name . it ' s really funny , except for , their new album really did come out and it ' s called ` ` quit fabrication our musical career , michelle , '' so i ' m a little creaked out by that . but also , i think i ' m really imp acting the future of music . we here at dark owl records pride ourselves on that : imp acting the future of music . also , the past . we impact the past in music . i ' m wearing a hat right now ! so , know that . i hate panic ! at the disco . i ' ve never actually heard their music , so i do not actually hate them so much as resent them . or rather , resent what they stand for . or rather , resent what i believe that they stand for . or rather , resent my perception of other people ' s projections of what they stand for . or rather , myself . i hate myself , is what i ' m trying to say . we have that in common , i think ! panic ! at the disco is probably fine if you were to ever listen to their music . lots of people buy lots of their music . of course , lots of people buy lots of ridiculous things : overpriced coffee , minivans , dogs , furniture , towels , medicine ... you name it , and some idiot will buy it . linda ! is that a public enemy cassette ? do not touch that ! you do not have hip hop access here ! we have a pretty good hip hop collection . mmm ... that ' s not true . it ' s just that one cassette . and it ' s broken . anyway , shirts and posters and trance music are all 50 % off this weekend at dark owl , so come visit the store . wait ... never mind . we ' re closed until further notice . you ' re not allowed in here anyway . not with that tattoo . who has a wood guthrie tattoo these days ? cecil : it will all be over soon . and then , something else will take its place . ` ` like waves , '' says the common metaphor . ` ` from dust to dust , '' says a simplifies version of a complicated philosophy . ` ` mmmmmmmm , zmmmmmmm , '' says the big bang , still echoing quietly through everything it created . let us return , one last time – before it , you , or anything else ends – to the september monologue . steve carlsberg : there are glowing arrows in the sky . you ca not see them . i do . there are dotted lines and arrows and circles . the sky is a chart that explains the entire world . but you ca not see it . i know that . the world makes sense . i– i believe that . i– i do . it has to . otherwise ... it would not make sense ! and that would be the worst thing that could possibly happen . no one listens when i talk . they hear , but ... they do not listen . even now , maybe your attention is drifting . why pay attention to me ? why pay attention to steve carlsberg ? ` ` there he goes again , with his theories and explanations . '' but i see them ! i see the arrows in the sky . i understand what is happening . night vale is a weird place . no one else sees that , i guess . but i do . it ' s not like other places . i ' ve never been other places , but i know . i know what other places are like . i ' ve read books . do not tell anyone , please . do not tell anyone that i ' ve read books . i have to maintain my position and the respect of my peers . i ' m a member in good standing of the pta . i bring scones and they are always the first item in the pot luck to go . i take great pride in that . my ... uh , brother-in-law , step-brother , brother-outside-of-the-law ... i can never get those terms straight . well , he just brings store-made hummus and wheat-free pit a chips . every time ! i make my scones with my own hands , from scratch . sometimes , i put in the zest of orange , sometimes i do not . they are not always the same . nothing is . people pick at the chips and hummus . they want to be polite . often , they are not . we all , all of us , so often fail at what we want to do . that ' s ok , as long as we understand our failure . as long as we see it . i see my failure to help my community the way i would like to help it . i would like to guide it somewhere new , but the only person who listened to me was that man on the desert bluff radio . and then ... well , then all the rest happened . the world would be better if more people saw the dotted lines and arrows in the sky . i can look out my window and see them ! i ' m doing that now . listen , i love my wife , and she loves her brother . and we both love our daughter , and my ... brother-in-law ? half-brother ? double-brother ? hm m ... well , he loves his niece . so that counts for a lot . that counts for most of it . i do not hate him the way he hat es me . how could i ? i understand him . he hat es me because he does not understand me at all . can not see the dotted lines . he can not see the arrows . i first met him at the wedding . he ' s busy , or he says he is . he does always seem to be at the station . or at least , he used to be . this last year ' s been good for him , i think . it has softened him a little , in the right places . although not at all toward me . but i never expect that . he was very nice when i first met him . ` ` welcome to the wedding , '' he said grandly . which was odd , since he actually arrived after me . but it was a nice gesture anyway , and i accepted it with a handshake and a ` ` hello ! it ' s an exciting day , is not it ? '' i said . ` ` here , try a scone ! '' i had made scones . it seemed right , in the midst of a formal celebration like that , to have a little touch of home , to remind people of the lifetime of simple gestures that this grand celebration was meant to launch . ` ` oh , '' he said . ` ` this is just scrumptious ! this is the best scone i ' ve ever had ! '' he has not said anything like that in some time . we chatted for a while . i do not remember what about . maybe the weather . no , definitely the weather . i remember it was the weather , because we had to stand in awkward silence for a bit as we waited for the music to stop playing . but then , it all turned . ` ` how ‘ bout those secret agents ? '' i asked , indicating the black-suited women and men lining the back of the room , taking photo and writing down everything that everyone said . ` ` aah , '' he said . ` ` yes , well ... '' he said . he was raised in the night vale tradition of silence . and with a belief in the power of hierarchy and bureaucracy . i had been raised that way too , but it did not stick . because i could see the arrows , and the dotted lines , and the circles laid out across the world . i could clearly see how things were ! the way that it was all organized , and for whose benefit . ` ` well , sure , '' i said . ` ` those agents from ... oh . well , um , this next part is complicated . people always just refer to them from being from a vague , yet menacing agency and ... while they are certainly menacing , there ' s nothing vague about them . '' i explained to cecil then exactly what branch they ' re from , who specifically they report to , and whose desk those reports ultimately land on . people could die for knowing these things . but i ' ve always known it . i could always just see it , how it all really was laid out . and as i talked , cecil ' s face changed . it twisted into a grimace . ` ` i wo not have you teaching janice lies like that , '' he bowled . and i ' m sorry for using such a melodramatic verb , but he really did . he bowled ! and then he refused to speak to me again . during the ceremony , he tried to object on the grounds that i knew and spoke aloud forbidden knowledge and dangerous truths . which is actually a mandatory reason to cancel a wedding according to the laws of night vale , but his sister talked him down . since then , though , he ' s never trusted me . it ' s because of janice . it ' s because i want janice to understand the world the way i do . i want her to see the arrows and dotted lines , to know the world , not just repeat what has been told to her . my brother-in-law , as you might imagine , disagrees . ` ` she will learn only what she is allowed to learn in schools ! '' he explains to me regularly , and loudly . ` ` do not poison her with education ! '' i do not know . maybe he ' s right . it ' s not like knowing has made my life easier . quite the opposite . quite the opposite . but every time i look up , i see them . glowing arrows in the sky , dotted lines and circles , a great chart that explains it all , and i ask you , how can i know all of this ? how can i understand , and not try to explain ? how can i see the dotted lines so bright and tangible , and deny them ? i have to try , even if it means that everyone – even my wife , or even janice – grows to hate me . the truth is more important than all that . it has to be . or else , why would it shine so clear above ? cecil : well , that ' s it for the september monologue . we ' ve said so much . what more is there to say ? today ' s proverb :
WTNV|A Carnival Comes to Town|15 September 2014|cecil : the secret to a long life lies in how acutely you perceive time.welcome to night vale . a quiet caravan of flat bed truck s rolled into town last night . the trailer were unmarred , except by age and neglect . the truck s park ed along band era street , in an abandoned lot in the heart of the up-and-coming abandoned lot neighborhood . people we do not know emerged from the truck s and began to unload tall lights and heavy speakers.perhaps may of you were jostled from slumber by the faint pulling of music that sounded like music you know , even though it was music you had never heard.perhaps you woke unaware there ever was a sun , confused by your own consciousness , hearing the echoes of these unknown chorus es , and found yourself singing along , mouth ing familiar words placed in an unfamiliar order.we do not know what these truck s have brought , or what those within them intend . all i can say is , you should not got near that abandoned lot on band era street until we find out more – which might take a while . it ' s a very busy day . we ca not investigate every horrify ing fleet of unmarred truck s . we ' ve got more important things , like this voicemail from my boyfriend ! carlos : hey , cecil ! i made so much progress today ! doug , and some of the other members of the army of warriors who roam this otherworld desert , took me to the top of the mountain , to the lighthorse up on it.oh , right ... i ' m still stuck in the desert otherworld . how are you ? i miss you ! anyway , they showed me the photo on the walls inside the lighthorse . one of the warriors , whose name is alicia , and who is not a woman or a man , and who is doug ' s partner , and who has a dog , and who is trying to make a new currency based on sand , walked me through the pictures . there were photo of living rooms , and park s , and laws ... photo of night valet asked if alicia took these photo , because they were good photo ! colourful , well composed , alive ! alicia shook their head no , and the other warriors in the room pointed quietly back to the photo , and i saw that they were literally alive . the people and all of the things that were not people moved in the photo ! blades of grass in the breeze , small bees spiral ing , a man refusing to smile – and all within the confines of rough driftwood frames.inside the lighthorse , you can see anywhere – although you can not go to any of those ... '' where . ` ` and , as i leave this message , i can see you , cecil ! yeah , i ' m watching you shave ! oh , it ' s cut e how you pull up your nose like that . oh ! but you missed a spot ' m sorry i have not had time to go looking for the doorway back to your dimension . i ' m learning so many things , though ! i– i promise . i promise to return soon . this ... desert otherworld is just so scientific ally interesting ! maybe it ' s the most scientific ally interesting community i ' ve ever seen ! i love you ! i ' ll try calling you again tonight . is it even night time there ? ugh , i ' ve lost all sense of time.cecil : so ... i do not know . all of that , and such.and now , the news.the foundation is finally being laid for the new old night vale opera house . old woman josie was on hand for the ceremony . in fact , she brought her own cement mix er and poured it herself . several creatures claiming to be angels , wearing yellow and orange triangles – the lo go of strexcorp , now of course owned by these same creatures – were on hand to assist . but josie kept slapping their many hands away when they attempted to help her with the heavy mix er and strenuous work . ` ` i ' m fine , erika ! i have this ! go get me some water , '' josie said , wiping her shriveled brow with a green handkerchief . ` ` i ai not that old ! '' she said before adding , ` ` hey ! you forgot to record castle last night ! make yourself useful and double-check the ti vo before i get home . ` ` one of the supposed angels – all of whom are named erika – pointed out that castle is in re runs , and she could probably download the episode she missed from tunes . there was a long pause as old woman josie stared at erika in silence , concrete churning its dull pulling hum , onlookers forgetting to ex hale , a single drop of sweat rolling down one of erika ' s seven cheekbones.and then josie said , ` ` ok , whatever . is the chopped marathon on tonight ? '' and continued her pour.the angel-like beings claim that strexcorp is night vale ' s first angel-owned and angel-operated company . they claimed this proudly , and even placed it on their brochure and signs – despite the great risk of arrest and imprisonment for the felony of acknowledging the existence of angels.completion of the new old night vale opera house is schedule for this coming spring . many town residents are excited and confused over the return of this cultural landmarks , as none of us know what an opera is . ` ` is it a type of de li ? '' asked one bystanders , who shield ed his eyes and asked not to be identified before dissipating into a black cloud and joining the rest of the cowardly air molecule . ` ` i heard opera is a virus you get from kissing , '' said another bystanders , who was clearly former mayor pamela mitchell wearing a fake mustache and clumsily altering her voice.nobody but old woman josie and her mysterious friends know what an opera is . hopefully we ' ll all find out soon , night vale ! hopefully it ' s a good thing . i have my doubts , though . i am sometimes more doubt than mantle strangers at the abandoned lot have begun unloading the fleet of truck s , removing large metal cases from the trailer and assembling gargantuan machines covered in rust and the faint echo of bright color.residents of the abandoned lot district , who usually just talk hopefully about a day when they ' ll be allowed to finally build homes , have reported hearing organ music and smelling deep fryers . they saw carnival workers carrying bags of strange candy and leading packs of unfamiliar loping animals into the lot . many of the strangers wear large wigs and bright painted faces . they carry foolish hats and mangled balloons.listeners , i know what this is , and it is not good . a carnival has come to our city , night vale . i do not even know how you can protect yourself from this wicked cultural affront to our community reached out to the city council but i just got their voicemail , which was the council saying , in unison , ` ` we ' re not here anymore . good luck with whatever that is in the abandoned lot ! if you d like to scream or cry in horror , please do so at the tone . '' so at least their voicemail is the usual one , but i do not think we ' ll get much help from them.night vale , i have only ever heard of carnival . i never thought i would ever have to actually see one . no one knows what they will do in the face of catastrophe until they are in that face , and here i am , still not knowing what to dora carnival . oooh , all the mysterious lights in the sky . i do not know how this carnival found us , nor what they intend , but i am certain it is not good.it is rumored that our neighbors in pine cliff once welcomed a traveling carnival . pine cliff is now inhabited only by ghosts . but i do not actually know if that was related to the carnival at all . they might have been that way already.and you know , there is a certain sweetness to the hastily-assembled rides , to the thought of eating air-blown paste sugar , your boyfriend winning you a stuffed animal at the bird-mocking booth , exchanging known quantities of fiat cash for meta-fiat paper coupon . oh , it sounds just ... it sounds just ... dreamy ! no ! these wicked magician of the midway ! they must be using mind control to draw us in . do not fall victim to ... holding hands hotly under the cool lights , the undulating swirl and discordant fugue of the merry-go-round about us . carlos ! oh , carlos ! let ' s go to the carnival – no ! stop it , cecil ! no ! night vale , avoid the carnival ! hide in your homes.this thursday , at the night vale public library , is the twice-annual cleaning of the books . the sheriff ' s secret police super secret special forces unit will be on hand to subdue the librarian , who regularly attempt to not only undermine our city with dangerous books , but also sink their sharp claws and pincers into library visitors before flying them off to eat or toy with or ... whatever it is they do to their victims.the cleaning of the books is our way of double-checking that the librarian are keeping a clean stock of municipally-approved books , such as the biography of helen hunt and all four of dean koontz ' s novels.librarians are well-known for speaking in books by dangerous authors . in 1988 , two – two ! copies of pride and prejudice were found in night vale . no one knows quite how many people read these copies , but the ensuing riots inconvenience hundreds and led to the current cleaning schedule.not everyone is in favor of this practice , though . new mayor dana cardinal issued a public rebuke of book cleaning . the mayor admitted that , while ` ` books are pretty dangerous , '' and she ` ` does not recommend them for everyone , '' we should ` ` concentrate more on protecting ourselves from the librarian themselves , who are the real danger . ` ` teenage book lover and heroic militia leader tamika lynn also offered her protest of this important event , saying , ` ` books and libraries are dangerous . which is exactly why we should protect them . librarian are conniving and vicious monsters , but they also know how to recommend a good read . their methods may be violent , but we must be willing to face great challenges in order to achieve great things . ` ` tamika continued , ` ` we will grow soft without books , night vale , '' as she waved her favorite copy of helen deity ' s the last samurai , onlookers shielding their eyes from the forbidden tome.i do not want to disagree too much with young tamika , i – i respect her leadership and her vast knowledge of books , but ... not everyone is cut out for reading difficult literature . perhaps ... perhaps we could split the difference . we could select just a few people in town who are allowed to read challenging books . that way the masses do not have to be exposed to complex ideas , and a small committee of trustworthy people , like tamika , can tell us in a gentle way what those books say . very quietly , so we do not have to hear them . it ' ll be all the fun and simplicity of an intellectual oligarchy , but without all the awful reading.intern maureen has returned to our studio . she was swept away a few weeks back by an enormous gust of wind , and we thought her lost . we held services for her at the rec center . her whole family was there . many of her friends from the night vale community college came , or at least , i assume they were friends from school . they all had human bodies with coyote heads , and they were eating armadillos out of a duffel bag . huh . college kids.well , we were all glad to see maureen come home safe . or , most of us . her family seemed ... disappointed , this being the second time they ' ve mourned her death in vain . they seemed emotional exhausted . not angry . they told her ` ` this is the last time , maureen . this is it ! no more ! ` ` anyway , today at work , maureen ' s been doing some research into carnival . and according to her , carnival need money to operate . if we do not want a carnival in town , then we should just not give them our money , and the carnival will go away . maureen has also handed me a report saying ... oh , my ! night vale ! the carnival grounds have been completed . a 40-foot tall wheel with empty compartments spins lazily in the hot sun , as broken speakers sing cacophonous platitudes over simplistic chord progressions.carnival workers are brandishing hammer next to a tower inscribed with ascending numbers and topped with an alarm bell.night vale residents have gathered near the grounds , but are not yet entering . a group of the carnival workers with white faces and bulbous noses and large shoes have opened the gates to the carnival grounds , and are cooing and beckoning our citizens to enter . these masked interlopers wish to sway you with broad tooth smiles , but they are nightmare , night vale . they are lies incarnate.remember that we are a great town . we are a great town that does not back down to grave danger . are we not the same town that defeated a smiling god , and a fascist corporatocracy , and once – once – survived a street cleaning day ? i said earlier that i did not know what to do in the face of a catastrophe , but i was wrong , night vale . i was wrong . when i think only of myself , i am scared . but knowing i am with you , i am not scared . we are in this together . i have a community i can trust and love . there is no need to be frightened of treacherous outsiders.outsiders ? wait . how did these outsiders get in ? night vale is not so easily found , so ... how have they so easily found it ? oh ! oh h ! the carnival gates have opened ! all of night vale is there . only i sit contained in my booth , helpless as usual.the carnival workers smile wider , and wider , and wider , and wider . breath is heard , loud and wet and without an obvious source . the birds are gone . there is a fearful infinity of an instant.i take you now , uncertain of what this next instant will bring , and none of you near a radio anyway , to the weather.the carnival has left . night vale citizens resisted entering the metal gates . they formed a semicircle around the opening and shouted , ` ` interlopers ! '' while pointing . as is our friendly , mandatory way of welcoming strangers.soon the painted people backed away , closing themselves into their miserable flat bed coral . they dis assembled their mechanical monstrosities and drove them away . night vale , en masse , waved fists and sticks and farm tools and cactus es and animal parts . our citizens chant ed curses upon the carnival.the carnival employees , in their haste , left behind several artifacts of their attempted threat to our sanctity – our vanity . we found clear plastic bags filled with cheaply-produced dolls . there was a large styrofoam-stuffed green and orange squirrel . as the truck s drove away , proud and vigilant night vale citizens set the squirrel ablaze , that un holy totem of that un holy carnival.the sun long gone , presumably scared away by the unexpected visitors , the happy fire of victory shone out to meet the tail lights of the retreating trucks.witnesses heard the carnival perpetrators saying things like , ` ` run ! '' and ` ` get out of here ! '' as they made their way to their truck s . shouts of ` ` what the hell is this town ? '' and ` ` where the hell are we ? '' and ` ` this is definitely not modes to ! '' and ` ` i think they ' re go n na kill us , stay ! run ! '' were the verbal white flags , signaling our triumph as a town – as a proud community that stood for itself once again.and inter maureen , who is ... hey ! maureen ? you look upset . are you upset ? is everything ok ? ugh , maureen does not look happy , listeners . i ' m not sure why maureen is not happy about today ' s victory she helped bring about . you are part of this , maureen ! this victory is also yours ! maureen ? do you not love victory over outsiders who mean us harm ? maureen , do you–well ! maureen left the control booth . she just got up in a huff and left . huh . teenager . i guess.stay tuned next for people arguing about sports . not on the radio , somewhere else . somewhere and soon people will be arguing about sports . i do not know what ' s happening next on the radio . i never do.and as always , good night , night vale . goodnight.today ' s proverb : say what you will about dance , but language is a limited form of expression .
WTNV|The University of What It Is|1 October 2014|let me be brief . let us all be brief . let us briefly be . welcome to night vale . listeners ? i received a call today from a dr . sylvis kayali , who introduced herself as working at the university of what it is . i told her i had never heard of that particular learning institution . actually , what happened is the name led to a comedic back and forth . ` ` what what is ? '' ` ` what it is ! '' ` ` the university is what ? '' ` ` no , no , of ‘ what it is . ' '' and so on . but eventually i accorded her the usual treatment of any academic person of importance – which was a yellowing lecture about the dangers of education , followed by tense , suspicious silence . taking advantage of that silence , she jumped in and explained that the university of what it is was concerned about one of their faculty members who had taken a sabbatical to investigate some ... probably fantastic al rumors about a strange town in the desert , and then had never returned . i told her that i did not know of any strange towns , just the pleasant burg we call home . ` ` well , '' she said , ` ` i ' ll keep trying , then . if you hear from a scientist going by the name of carlos , please let us know . '' as you can imagine , listeners , i made all sorts of noise when she said that . but she had already hung up , and had left no call-back number . my phone screen just showed a picture of a beach during a bad storm , with a shivering human figure off in the distance , again and again nearly but not quite swept away by the pound ing surf . i think that ' s an area code of ... what ? idaho ? i do not have these things memories . more on this as i aggressive investigate . well , it ' s time again for one of our audience ' s most requested segments ... i assume . i ' ve never actually asked , but ... i ca not imagine anyone having a different perspective from my own , so i assume this is what listeners are most focused on . it ' s time to check back in with khoshekh and his floating kitten . khoshekh , the cat floating exactly four feet off the ground in the men ' s room here at the station , is doing great ! nothing to report . he ' s a healthy kitty going through his third molting of the year , and his fur cusp is as radiant and sticky as any cat ' s has ever been . he loves to be petted , and the petting is completely survival ... with the correct antibiotics . his kitten are , of course , also floating in fixed locations in the same bathroom , and are being cared for by their various owners . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , has especially taken after one of the kitten , who he has named – confusing – ` ` larry le roy . '' ` ` oh , larry le roy is just the best , '' larry le roy said , in what was either an expression of affection or extreme egotism . either way , he ' s being a great dad to that little cat , and we wish larry le roy and larry le roy the best . and now , a word from our sponsors . traditionally , when cooking speak , there have been a few basic rules to follow . for instance , using a form of meat that is recognized by both the current culture and the human body as ` ` food ; '' following basic food safety procedures , so as to prevent illness ; not intentionally not intentionally bleeding on the finishing speak ... but that ' s just traditionally . here at out back steakhouse , we say ` ` no rules , just right . absolutely no rules . '' food safety ? push ! federal law ? ugh ! the laws of physics ? what are you , a arc ? it ' s weird here . the speak float . sometimes the speak is and also is not , simultaneously . sometimes the speak is a chair , and we point at the chair and we say , ‘ that chair is a speak . ' and we make you eat it . that is the one rule : if we say something is a speak , you have to eat it . no questions asked . i know we said there are no rules , but that itself is a rule and so is void . you want your philosophy non-contradictory ? go to simpler . in the bathroom , where most places have signs saying ` ` employees must wash hands , '' we just carved ` ` land of the free '' directly into the wall . there is not even a sink in there . neck , our bathroom are just sealed vaults full of poisonous gases . no rules . we might kill you . we ' ve killed a lot of people . out back steakhouse . do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law . i received another call from dr . kayali . before she even spoke , i told her that i , in fact , knew a carlos , and explained , in a completely businesslike and journalistic tone , the tenor of our relationship . ` ` carlos is there '' she said . only she did not put a question at the end of it . so maybe she was just saying ` ` carlos is there . '' in either case , she told me that this was surprising , and that the university of what it is would send someone right away to see why their faculty member had never made it home . i said , ` ` he never mentioned a university to me . '' and she said , ` ` do we ever dare to speak of higher education to the ones we love ? '' which is a valid point . education is such a ... scar y and forbidden subject that you would be a fool to mention it out loud . i forgave carlos for this lapse ... or , i will , as soon as i can get him on the phone . hey , carlos ? call me . in the meantime , i ' ll let you know what happens when the folks from the university of what it is come by . and now , the community calendar : on monday , the baristas of night vale are inviting everyone in town to come to the barista district for the annual barista cultural faire , where they will be performing traditional barista dances like the twice-dip and the mustache snort , and serving traditional barista foods , like lemon poppy seed scones . there will be a showing of barista-themed moves , like jaws and jaws 2. and , no ra jones will make an appearance via a photo of her tacked up on a wall so you can say , ` ` oh , look ! that ' s no ra jones ! '' while pointing at that photo . tuesday is a day for trying to find what you ' ve lost . tear through your house , dress in clothes you have not worn in years , re enact situations from your childhood , and try to get them to turn out differently . you will get it all back ! you will finally have lost nothing ! it ' s all possible , and it ' s all healthy . wednesday is a secret that has been badly kept . thursday is a day of remembrance and memorial , dedicated to all the people who will happen to die on that thursday . the city council would like us all to take a moment and think about the many , many people who will just happen to die in that particular frame of time , for unrelated reasons , and adding up to no coherent picture of human existence . please , find the time within your life to mourn those who will , by complete chance , be gone . unless you turn out to be one of those people . in which case , hey ! you ' re off the hook on all this tedious grief stuff ! friday is a plan that has been poorly thought through . ` ` saturday is absolutely nothing you should be worried about , '' say sulking , buzzing figures hiding in all of our attics , in a statement that they issued today , thus revealing to us , for the first time , their existence . sunday is a lie that has been foolishly believed . this has been the community calendar . jackie fiero , who runs the only pawn shop in town , which for some reason is named ` ` lucinda ' s pawn shop , '' announced today that she is having a sale on ideas about time . ` ` people keep coming by and pawn ing their ideas about time ! '' jackie told a friend of hers in confidence , never knowing that it was going to end up on the radio . ` ` and , like , i do not want to turn them down , because it looks like they need the money , but du de ! how many ideas about time am i supposed to keep ? none of these ideas make any sense anyway ! '' so , if you ' re looking for a gently-used idea about time , or perhaps if you pawn ed your own idea about time and are now able to retrieve it , then get on down to lucinda ' s pawn shop , and talk to jackie . do not know where her pawn shop is ? do not worry , when you need it , then ... then you will know . and now , corrections . in a previous broadcast , we swung a baseball bat wildly around the studio , knocking our microphone onto the ground until all it could pick up was the stomping of our feet as we systematically destroyed all of our possessions in a disguised attempt to make he world better , and ourselves more happy ! after that , we mistaken referred to trish hide as the assistant deputy to the mayor , when she is , in fact , the deputy assistant to the mayor . we deeply regret this error . this has been corrections . still have not heard from carlos . the representatives from the university of what it is arrived . they are be suited , and behatted , and beta number of other things besides . they move in a group of three , led by dr . kayali herself , looking at everything and everyone they encounter with a critical eye , and what looks like a sneer . that could just be the natural set of their faces . i rushed out to meet these people , that could perhaps tell me something that i do not know about the love of my life , only to find that , flush with their recent victory over the carnival , night vale citizens had cornered the staff members from the university of what it is , shouting and waving household items like sticks and police baton . ` ` interlopers ! '' they cried . ` ` interlopers ! '' ` ` no ! no ! '' i said . ` ` well , yes ! '' i said , because they were interlopers , but ... good interlopers . if only there was a word that meant ` ` good interlopers . '' dr . kayali did not seem afraid of the crowd . she considered the night vale residents before her , and patted the air in a placating motion . and , by the way , did you know that the term for a group of citizens is ` ` a mob ? '' huh . the english language is so funny . the doctor ' s calm demeanour did not transfer to the crowd around her . they bowled and jeered , saying things like , ` ` remember that carnival ? let ' s do that again ! '' and chanting popular slogans , like ` ` aaaaargh ! outsiders ! '' i , more than anyone , know that not all outsiders are bad . most outsiders are . aaaargh . outsiders . but some outsiders are great ! the best ! my favorite . and these outsiders know about that outsider . ` ` listeners , '' i said to the mob , because the moment i began speaking my relationship to them was one in which they were hearing me , i said , ` ` please ! let us proceed with caution , and empathy . we ' ve never tried it before , maybe it ' ll work . '' but the mob was beyond hearing , and they continued their advance . for the first time , i looked out at the faces of my fellow citizens and saw them – not as friends as companions , but as a dangerous combination of suppression and indoctrination . so i did the only thing that i could think to do in that moment : ` ` if you wo not listen , '' i said , ` ` then i will make you listen . i will make you all listen ... to the weather . while the crowd was distracted by the sudden weather , i was able to flag down a passing sheriff ' s secret police helicopter which was conducting routine surveillance operations just overhead . i explained to the officers inside , all of whom where wearing loose-fitting gowns and richard dixon masks , that i was in need of a lift to the radio station for important community reasons . they did not respond , but they also did not do anything else . so , i hustled the representatives from the university of what it is onto the craft , and we left the hostile mob listening docilely below us . ` ` please tell me everything ! '' was how i casually started the conversation with dr . kayali . she blinked . ` ` that would take a long time , and i feel like much of it would be things you already know , '' she said , continuing . ` ` for instance , tying shoes , operating your own tongue , feeling insecure , and other things you would know these things already . i clarified that i meant everything about carlos and her university . and this is what she said , as we hammered our way across the sky . she actually shouted it , to be heard over the rotors , so this is what she shouted . she shouted that she is from the university of what it is , and that they have been looking for some time for a faculty member named carlos , who is a professor of science . he has been missing for decades , and they were getting very worried . they had no choice but to hire a new professor of science , but it is not going well , because the guy they hired is a ` ` new media artist , '' interested in college as it intersect with social media , and he is not even sure what science is . they do not know why they hired that guy ... it had somehow made sense when they did it . she told me , in a quieter voice , once we had landed near the safety of the station , and had decided that the sheriff ' s secret police were not going to prevent us from leaving the helicopter , she told me that if this is how our town treats outsiders , then carlos is in more danger than she thought . i told her that carlos was not treated that way , that he was well-loved by everyone , and especially loved by someone . and she said , ` ` sure , sure . '' but she did not sound like she believed it . and then she said that there was much she needed to do , but that they would make sure carlos found his way to safety , and they were looking forward to him taking back over the one class they have on science , because the new media artist guy is really missing it up . she said she had to go , but gave me her card in case i ever wanted to get in touch with her . i imagine that i definitely will . so there it is . so many questions , so many possible answers , and like the title of that much-beloved picture book classic , how many lies ? listeners , i do not know everything about carlos and he does not tell me everything . that is ok . we are not one person . how lonely that would be ! a couple who has made themselves one so completely , that they are once again alone . we are two people , separate . unique . and joined only where we choose to join . i do not know what is his affiliation , truly , to the university of what it is . perhaps i will never know , but i can know about the taste of food he has made me , or the feeling of his hand in mine , or the absence of his hand not in mine . i can feel the distance between us , and i can know that that distance , viewed properly , is no distance at all . but still , i think i ' ll keep dr . kayali ' s card handy , just in case i ever need her , or what she knows . and that time may come . certainly so many other times i never even thought possible have come before it . stay tuned next for a loss of words , an absence of silence , some noise . some noise . and then , perhaps ... and then , perhaps ... meaning . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : language will evolve , regardless of your attempt to literally lock it away in a secluded tower . obs .

you ' re nevada ? dan : wait , you are ? sparks : yeah . we have met . dan : i did not recognize him ! should ought gotten my glasses prescription re filled , but i done shot my low-down cheatin'-a-punker ophthy-mologist . claxon : i got a good optometrist on sa turn . samuel : claxon , dan ' s ophthalmologist was a medical doctor who completed college , and had at least eight years additional medical training . whereas your sa turn optometrist ai not nothing ' but a four year degree-havin ' nobody what ca not do much more than give vision tests . claxon : all ' s dan wanted was a prescription upgrade ! dan : well , i also got a it ch in my eye wants a-proddin ' and a-pokin ' at in case it ' s serious . sparks : i reckon i got something here pointed at you , might take care of any ... problems you might have . dan : is that a laser ... sparks : it ' s a laser pistol , yeah . dan : ... pistol . i d swear . i should taken care of my eyes so they can take care of me like the poster says at my ophthalmologist ' s office . sparks : well , you do not got ta take care of all your eyes , just the ones you aim to keep . my eye doctor got that poster hanging ' up . bought it from a dentist , crossed out teeth , wrote in eyes . he ' s not great at it . samuel : do not fret about it , nice man dan . claxon and i got our own guns trained on the marshal . coach : sparks nevada , though i am no longer under on us to you , i have directed my weapon upon these outlaws , thus putting you under on us to me . sparks : fine . felt on : and i am under on us to myself , due to how i ' m cowering under this d-d-d-d-d-d-desk . sparks : yeah , gold star , felt on . nice man dan , last i saw you , you were heading ' up to spend time with your boy , highway man dan , to set him right . what happened ? dan : ca not say i know exactly , marshal . took a wrong turn somewhere . felt on : i do not see how you could all make chit-chat with guns pointing ' every which way or at each other . sparks : the talking ' keeps people from shooting ' , usually . go on , dan . dan : well , in the interest of fairness , we sold shoes for a piece , him investing ' his time in my interests . then , in the spirit of further fairness , he took me rob bin ' to show me his interests . sparks : yeah , and let me guess : you took better to rob bin ' than he did to shoes . dan : havana ... exactly . then he met a gal ... claxon : and she introduced him , no doubt , to unprecedented levels of adrenalin , dopamine , and serotonin . samuel : no doubt . he he ... humans , you know ? coach : oh , yes . felt on : what happens ? it happens – not to me , but to low-down highway robbers apparently . dan : hey , hey , that ' s my son . felt on : sorry , kind of . dan : you know , i felt like a third wheel , highway rob bin ' alongside them two . then i realized , i was not rob bin ' due to li kin ' it , so much as to be with my son is what i liked . sparks : www . dan : so , uh , we parted ways in hopes that they ' ll visit me sometimes on their own volition . samuel : holidays and such ... dan : that ' s exactly it . sparks : all right , but hang on . if you quit rob bin ' , why are you here with outlaws and guns ? dan : fair question . sparks : thank you . dan : i got one last score in me to provide the stake with which to return to the business community . make shoes again . sparks : all right . claxon : from shoe man to robber to rob bin ' to become a shoe man again . you just never know where life will take a soul . samuel : roots ai not got no souls ! claxon : was talking ' about his human soul , but since you bring it up , i reckon we do , in fact . samuel : we do not . end of story . claxon : we feel , we think , energy can neither be created nor destroyed ... samuel : oh , not everything is an invitation to a techno-theological conversation , claxon ! claxon : some things are , though ! sparks : i can settle it for you . i can settle it for you right now , send you to meet your maker . samuel : jeremy ? sparks : no – jeremy ? no . samuel : jeremy wadnett ' s my maker . sparks : no , i know what no . no . i was talking techno-theologically . coach : and observe how you have alienated precisely three fourths of the occupants of this room . all : samuel : a space marjun just said alienated . ' what a world . sparks : yeah , it ' s a door . all right . it ' s a door of a world . dan , why are you rob bin ' the marshal station if you ' re looking for a stake for a business ? we do not keep no cash register . dan : i ' m a stickler for planning ' plans ! we aim to remove obstacles to our design from the large equation before we start opening ' up bank vaults and the like . sparks : hm m . samuel : you ' re that obstacle . sparks : am i ? yeah , no , thanks , i got it . yeah . claxon : and so ' s any flesh-wrapped guts-burrito in this room with you , since they ' re now privy to our plans . coach : sparks nevada , you are now under so much on us to me . sparks : all right , all right . felt on : marshal ? sparks : what ? felt on : heeelllllp ! sparks : ok . felt on : i ' m under the desk ! sparks : yeah . samuel : we know you ' re down there , dum dum ! want i should dispatch these two collateral damages , dan ? sparks : hang on , your trigger finger moves a hair , sam bolt , and coach will shut you down . samuel : hair ? ? no thank you , but i take your meaning and i reckon i ' ll aim my guns at coach , then . coach : on us ! claxon : looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned venetian stand off , then , marshal ! sparks : nice man dan , you are aware the town bank offers low interest loans , right ? dan : who d grant one to a fell whose resume reads ` ` 1 : shoemakers , 2 : outlaw , 3 : third wheel , 4 : back to outlaw ? '' claxon : do not let your occupation define you ! sparks : all right . tell you what . y'all stand down and maybe i can do something ' to help you . samuel : us too ? sparks : no , you two are definitely go in ' to jail . dan : well , then your offer is politely rejected , marshal . i may not have much , but i still got my words . and leaving ' these metal cattlemen to rust in jail would mean my fidelity tank is down to zero . claxon : well , that ' s kind of you to say , dan . dan : now let ' s end this stand off , fell as . the hard way . sparks : all right . emily stalwart : marshal nevada ! come in , sparks nevada ! it ' s me , emily stalwart . i am call in ' you on these here space com ms . sparks : all right . uh , hang on a second , dan . dan : hey , you got it . claxon : us too ? sparks : yes , of course , you too . yes . dan : yeah , hold off . emily : claxon ? is that you ? claxon : in the iron ! emily : aww , dan g it ! i did not run you off the moon just to have you go to mars to cause trouble for my best friend and mentor ! claxon : ai not sorry . coach : human designate emily stalwart , i am present as well . emily : rowdy , coach . sparks : all right , listen , emily , i ' m in the middle of a venetian stand off right now dan : no , go ahead and take this , we ' ll be right here . sparks : thanks , nice man dan , that is ... really nice . all right , what is on your mind , emily ? emily : well , you know how you made me marshal of the moon ? sparks : yeah , you earned it , of course , yeah . emily : yeah . you said that if ' n things ever get hairy that i should contact you . like i ' m doing now ? sparks : things are getting hairy down there , are they , marshal stalwart ? samuel : ugh , hair ! sparks : all right . emily : something ' hairy ' s happening , marshal , but it defies description . sparks : try describing ' it . emily : sensible . it ' s the moon . the moon is disappearing . samuel : what ? ok , time out from the showdown , i want to see this . felt on : you can see the earth ' s moon from here ? samuel : oh , you old humans got the worst possible ocular sensory , i ' m telling you . coach : oh , i keep telling them . samuel : ok . coach : bagropa ! the moon of the earth is disappearing ! claxon : if ' n the earth moon disappears , then the whole of the cosmos will be thrown into chaos ! samuel : and any satellite could be next . claxon : or planet , even ! felt on : you think ? emily : there ' s harrier information to impart . i got a deputy . she ' s a coburg named del ores county , and she ' s whip smart , same as i ' m whip tough . we get along despite our differences , and sometimes we learn along the way that we ai not so different . sparks : all right . well , sounds great . she got a theory about how or why your moon ' s disappearing ' ? emily : oh , more ' n that . she ' s pin pointed the source of the danger to thousands of years ago in the past ! samuel : if i may ... time is dangerous . just my opinion . sparks : all right . claxon : second ! emily : deputy county rigged a mechanism whereby she can send someone to the past to stop what ' s causing my moon to disappear ! sparks : ok , well , like i said , i ' ve kind of got my hands full right oooh , you know what ? hang on . claxon : yeoow ! you shot my dumb hands off ! samuel : hey ! we ' re in a time out ! sparks : yeah , but ... samuel : my ... my guns ! you shot ' em to pieces ! dan : i am lowering and dropping ' my gun , marshal . sparks : very good . dan : well ... let me tell you , comic little stuff is a strong argument not to shoot marshals . sparks : mmm-hmm . claxon : plans go out the window for the sake of the cosmos , dude. ( ? ) sparks : all right . emily ? now i can probably go . emily : oh , great . i ' ll activate the remote temporal shift beam to your coordinate . sparks : all right , and i will just stand right here . coach : sparks nevada . you shot the metal enemy whose fire arm was aimed at me . i am now under on us to you for saving me . sparks : no , great . coach : my final on us . sparks : coach , we ' ll talk about your on us when i get back , all right ? for now , just ... what ? coach : oooooonnnuuuuuuuusssssssss ! cecil : today you will meet a beautiful stranger . actually , hundreds of beautiful strangers . everyone is beautiful and you know almost none of them . welcome to night vale . great news , listeners ! today is the first annual destroy the moon festival , sponsored by the civic committee for public holidays and private silent weeping for no reason you can name . all citizens are encouraged to gather in mission grove park , where we will attempt to destroy the moon . the hastily-formed civic committee , which just sort of popped up last wednesday – and , like most local organizations , is anonymous managed – is also encouraging you to bring your children to the festival . or , if you do not have children , to bring someone else ' s children . or , if children are not even real , and this existence is all a collective unconscious of incomprehensible nightmare , then just bring a canned good for $ 5 off your admission . in any case , bring as many children and canned goods as possible . ` ` we ' ll need them later , '' says the civic committee . ` ` not for anything to do with the moon , '' they added . ` ` for something else . it ' s a surprise . look , forget we said anything . we just do not want to ruin it , '' the civic committee said from the loudspeakers recently mounted at op each of our homes . ` ` but definitely bring those kid s and canned goods , '' they added , which was then followed by a maniac al laugh . ` ` oh , hey . this microphone is still on , '' they concluded . listeners ? we ' re getting reports that there is a strange being in town . it arrived here quite suddenly , i assume , in a chariot from the sky with wheels of fire and the background hum of the cosmos taken corporal form as its celestial force . since i am a professional journalist , this is what i must assume . or , maybe it just drove into town in a mid-priced sedan . there ' s lots of ways to get here , and there are some ways you can not . this stranger is interfering with our destroy the moon festival , asking us things about the moon , and our intentions for its future ; asking kind of bizarre things like , ` ` why do you attempt to destroy the satellite designate the moon ? '' listeners , i know there are no dumb questions , just dumb realities , but even i ca not explain that one . i ' m receiving varying reports about the stranger ' s appearance . it is : tall , with blue skin , bulging black eyes , and common human-like antennae . so , there are very few details that would make the stranger stand out from most people . either way , keep a close eye out for strangers . and if you see someone you do not know , point and shout , ` ` interlopers ! '' as is our friendly night vale custom . and now , let ' s have a look at traffic . picture a dog . but with more scales , and less imbecile enthusiasm . and then some more scales . ooh ! and also a biomechanic fork ed tongue . are you all picturing that ? now , picture that dog with horns . great and terrible horns , curving ivory spiral stained with the slow-moving prey . here , in your mind , breathing – not the crest and trough of inhaled and exhales made by plain binary lungs , but a multi-stage gasp of air . in , in , in , out . in , in , out . not so much a breath of life , but a whispered suggestion of something much , much worse . picture this dog . close your eyes , if you must , but you will see it either way . and it will see you either way . are you picturing the dog ? you are ? good . so , yeah . um , maybe avoid unarmed travel on route 800 between ex its 10 and 13 today . this has been traffic . and now , a word from our sponsors . today ' s sponsor is , um ... oh , well i ' ve never actually heard of this brand , it is patriot brand cigarettes . and of course , to represent them , popular celebrity spokes-being deb , who is a sentiment patch of haze . deb : well , hello there , cecil ! cecil : hi ! deb : how are things going with the moon ? cecil : oh , i ' m glad you asked . we have been trying and trying ... deb : i do not care . cecil : ok . deb : it was a rhetoric question , like ` ` do you love me ? '' or ` ` what is your social security number ? '' cecil : oh h . i ' m sorry , i ' m not very good at picking up on social cues . deb : i am here on behalf of patriot brand cigarettes . listen , sure , cigarettes will give you cancer . sure , you ' ll experience pain . sure , a lot of pain . sure , coughing . sure , sadness . sure , days spent looking from a bed that you ca not leave to the ne on glow of a sky that you ca not help , through a window that you ca not open . sure . all of that , sure . but i – i do not actually i do not have a counter-point to that . it all just sounds like a bunch of human problems that do not really affect a sentiment patch of haze . so just buy some patriot brand cigarettes . what ' s the worst that could happen ? i do not care . cecil : well , thank you , deb . that sounds terrifying and deadly ! deb : oh , gosh , cecil ! you know how to just flatter a sentiment patch of haze . cecil : yeah . deb : goodby , human . cecil : oh , ok . well , the first annual destroy the moon festival has hit on a few hitches . in addition to the terrifying outsider confusing everyone with questions about why we want to destroy that hideous , mocking rock , the festival attended have been struggling to actually destroy the moon . they ' ve been throwing things at the moon for hours now . they ' ve tried common household rubbish , like coffee filters and pets , but those did very little to harm the moon . in fact , most of the objects simply arc ed and fell after only 20 feet or so , dropping uselessly to the earth we all know and distrust . some of the citizens tried throwing the kid s and canned goods , but no , no no . that ' s just incorrect . ` ` those things are for something else , '' the civic committee reminded . ` ` something that will come later . '' save the kid s and can s for that , listeners . but beside that , it does not matter what we throw , as none of it can seem to make it to even half as high as the moon , however high that thing is . ` ` i dun no , sixty feet ? at least ? '' say reputable and very cut e scientists , whose turn it is to call me tonight , about ... you know , seven , or six , yeah ... anyway , scientists agree that the whole ` ` throwing things '' plan is just not working . actually , you know what ? call me at six . carlos ? call me at six . cool . um , i have invited my friend , former inter and current all-powerful night vale mayor , dana cardinal , into the studio . um , she ' s been out at the festival all day . so , dana , tell us what ' s been happening ? dana : thanks , cecil . as you know , the destroy the moon festival started slowly , but we should not worry . i talked to the civic committee , and throwing things was just the first plan . there are many others . the next plan is that we all should direct harmful remarks at the moon . do not hold back . here , i ' ll demonstrate . hey moon ! your glow is the death rattle to the breaking light of day ! you symbolized all that is meek and obscured and radiant with shame . and also , you ' re just a big old dumb on top of all that , you stupid piece of rock that could not even escape orbit and float away forever into the forever away . do you want to give it a try ? cecil : oh , u mm , ok . i do not understand you or your history , and so i fear and detest you ! dana : good ! that was very good , cecil . cecil : thank you . dana : i really want to get the word out to everyone going to the festival today to be prepared to cast great insults at that ridiculous gray circle . or half-circle . or crescent shape or ... whatever it is . ugh ! it ' s always changing ! it ' s like , make up your mind , idiot ! cecil : right ? totally ! ok , listeners , um , you heard dana , let ' s all practice . what i want you to do is imagine the moon is above you . just imagine me holding up my hand right now . and now , imagine that my hand is the moon . and i want you to fill your lungs with air , the air that you take for granted , and shout an insult at the moon . let ' s say , ` ` i hate you , moon ! '' crowd : i hate you , moon ! cecil : great , now do it louder . crowd : i hate you , moon ! cecil : even louder ! crowd : i hate you , moon ! cecil : ok , that was great ! yeah ! so , um , now imagine that my hand is down ( which it is ) , and when you ' re in mission grove park , that is what you should do . we are going to vanquish this foolish nocturnal glow orb once and for all . and while you silently continue to practice your shouting , i take you now to the weather . steve carlsberg : excuse me ! cecil ! wait , stay where you are ! please ! cecil : no ! no , no , no , no , no ! steve : oh , yeah . cecil : do not come into my radio studio and interrupt important weather up dates , steve carlsberg ! you have destroyed the sanctity of my working environment . steve : ok . look , cecil , i ' ve been watching what ' s happening with the destroy the moon festival , and i found out some things . important things . things that may be of interest to your listeners . cecil : dana , does it smell weird in here ? it kind of smells weird , right ? steve : look , contrary to what our science teachers have told us , night vale , the moon is a real thing . it is not 60 feet off the ground , but hundreds of thousands of miles away from us ! cecil : oh , no you ... steve : in space ! cecil : i ... i ca not . steve : yes ! yes ! in fact , american astronauts have visited the moon several times ! look , look . i know most scientists will tell you that the moon is a universally shared dream . scientists have long said that there ' s not really a moon there , and that no one is actually seeing a moon , but we all pretend that we do , because we are told from an early age that it is there . astronomers believe the moon to be part of a cultural narrative , and ... and if we stop believing there was a moon , it simply would no longer be there , not unlike what happened to the dinosaurs . but i found this heavily-charred , yet still-legible book . dana : steve ? i think that book was supposed to be destroyed in last week ' s monthly library cleanse . i do not know if that ' s safe to read . steve : you ' re right , dana , which is why i avoided reading most of it . also , because i do not like looking directly at words . but this one last part ? it stood out . look here . read this last line of the final chapter . dana : ` ` so , in conclusion , the moon is totally real . you d better believe it . '' and then there ' s a winking smiley face with two finger guns on either side . wo w , cecil , steve may be onto something . this looks like real science ! carlos : excuse me , i might be able to help better determine what is and is not science , ok ? like , for instance , minivans ? science . horses ? pure fiction . cecil : carlos ! what are you doing here ? no , wait ... did you find your way back from that other desert world already ? carlos : no , i ' m just projecting myself here . it ' s actually a trick that dana taught me . i ca not do it for long , or physically interact with anything , though . cecil : aww . cecil and carlos : dan g . dana : right ? carlos : i felt that something very unusual and dangerous is about to happen , and i knew that night vale would need someone who knew what is and is not science . steve : but it ' s ... all due respect , but it ' s in the book ! cecil : anyone can write a book , steve . it does not mean that it ' s true . have you ever read a hundred years of solitude ? not a single true thing in that book . entirely made up . people are all like , ` ` this book is so good , like , such a classic of postmodern literature , '' but it ' s entirely lies ! this is the problem with books , steve ! lies ! coach : the book is correct . cecil , dana , and steve : interlopers ! carlos : oh , uh , right . interlopers ! cecil : no , did you not see the on air sign outside the door ? coach : i detected no such sign with any of my myriads senses . steve : yeah , me neither , with my seven of them . dana : me neither . cecil : well , i wrote right here on my to do list , um , ` ` put on the air sign above studio door . '' carlos : cecil , is there a line through that item ? cecil : noooo ... carlos : what about a check mark ? cecil : uh , noooo ... and i do not understand what you ' re getting at . coach : humans ! i have come here to ... to , uh ... steve : night vale ? coach : night vale ... carlos : uh , sorry , no , it ' s night vale . coach : that is what i said , night vale . dana : night vale . coach : please cease attempting to destroy the satellite designate the earth ' s moon , denizens of night vale . cecil , carlos , steve , and dana : night vale ! coach : do you not know what the destruction of your single moon would do to your planet ? cecil : she ! most likely nothing ! dana : maybe even good things . carlos : i know exactly what it would do , thank you very much . i mean , what is science but an exact knowledge of what the future holds , ok ? coach : bagropa ! human , your teeth and hair are the finest teeth and hair i have ever encountered ! no . no , second-finest . no , finest . first . no , you – you know , top two . cecil : yeah . yeah . right ? steve : look , everybody , i d listen to this guy ! he seems to understand things about space . he looks like a person that ... coach : mmm . not a person . steve : ok , like a guy , then , who ... coach : no . steve : like a sentiment entity that understands the careful balance of the cosmos . where are you from , anyway , stranger ? coach : i am from g'loot praktaw . dana : i do not know what that is . coach : you designate it mars . cecil : no pe , still does not ring a bell . steve : never heard of it . carlos : i am a scientist and so i , of course , know exactly whatever that place he said was , so ... dana : yeah , do not know it . coach : i have come from mars , and the future , to this time and place to relieve my on us and to save the moon of this planet . who is this civic committee that has been planning to destroy your moon ? cecil : nobody knows . dana : oh , i do . cecil : oh . dana : i met them yesterday , a couple of really nice roots . carlos : roots ? that is exciting ! coach : you possess roots in this place , in this time ? dana : yeah , made of metal . inexplicable filled with life and aimless sentence , like everybody else . roots . oh , they ' re right over there ! claxon : that ' s right , blue skin ! we are still in the future , standing with your endocrine system-having pal back on your red planet and we are also here in the past , fixing ' to bring down the moon . samuel : yeah , we do not care about no moon ! claxon : no pe ! i shot a moon of plato just to watch it die . samuel : folks are always excited about their moon , writing ' poetry and understanding ' the tides and painting ' pictures of a waning fibrous pseudo orb gently lighting a soft silver forest lining a crystalline lake as a family of deer peer out from the shadows of winter trees . claxon : yeah . and always go in ' on about the way the clouds seem like a reflection of the moonlight , which is a reflection of the sunlight , which is a reflection of a history so distant it wisps away like clouds . samuel : we do not like it . dana : wait , what did you need with the kid s and canned goods ? samuel : oh , we set up a kid s craft fair near the festival and started a canned food drive for the needy . claxon : there ' s also a bounce house . samuel : ooh , yeah , right , there ' s a bounce house too . claxon : should be fun for them and ... and support a real good cause . samuel : adios ! cecil : oh ... ok . carlos : my detector ' s telling me that those scientific ally fascinating roots have left through time using a remote temporal shift beam . just so you know . coach : without direct communication with the human marshal designate emily stalwart across time and space , i have no way to follow them . cecil : no , wait , we have a radio tower . and that is for communicating . dana : or you could just use my temporal shift beam . coach : you possess your own temporal shift beam ? dana : um , everyone does . the city council decriminalized time travel months ago . coach : then i shall pursue them . oh , it is your device . do you wish to come ? i do not care to be under on us to a past being . dana : i ' ve spent enough time moving weird ly through time and space . it was so-so . not really my thing , so you boys go on ahead . cecil : you know what ? i ' ll join you . i ' ve always wanted to know if the future was real , or an elaborate urban legend . dana : here , let me just find my temporal shift beam . it ' s somewhere in my bag , just ... cecil : listeners ? stay tuned next for a digital sound effect , an empty stage , and several minutes of people moving about the theater to buy drinks and chat and use restrooms . and , as always : good night , night vale . coach : night vale . steve : incorrect . dana : oh , i found it ! cecil : good night . joseph f ink : end of side a. please turn to side b. cecil : ladies and gentlemen , and all betwixt , between , and beyond : we were so rudely interrupted by a disgrace to our decent ... steve : hi , everyone ! cecil : yes , him . we were interrupted before we could give you some important climate information , so ... steve : yeah , i ' m real sorry about that , cecil . cecil : oh my goodness . steve : i just ... i had some important information to convey ! cecil : so , i take you all ... steve : i think it turned out ok , though . i mean , i said the information , and now that the whole moon business is really starting to heat up ... cecil : yes . steve : you know , uh ... cecil : as i was saying , listeners of every kind , i take you now ... steve : ohio , this is my favorite part ! cecil : steven eugene carlsberg ! please ! i take you now to ... steve : oh-ho-ho boy , i ca not wait ! cecil : you know what ? that ' s it . forget it . there ' s no actual weather report for today . so ... let ' s just jump right ... steve : no no no no no no no no , wait ! i have a weather report ! ♫ who ' s that ? fly in ' at the speed of light ?

it ' s covered in ... is this tar ? ad-man 2 : we ' re on ! ad-man 1 : boy , i ' m tired after this long work day . if only there was some way of feeling more aware ! more awake ! ad-man 2 : well , have you tried ... i can barely read this ! ad-man 1 : more awake ! more of a human ! more ... me ! or ... more me s . if the whole world was me , and we had no need to communicate , or fight , or work , or do anything but stand there and know what all the rest of us were thinking , because ... we would all be thinking those things at the same time . ad-man 2 : my fingers are burning ! ad-man 1 : every once in a while one of us would smile in acknowledgment of what we were thinking , but only one of us . the rest of us would not need to smile , because that one single one of us would have done it for the rest of us . so we would all know that , and do nothing . ad-man 2 : does this even mention workjuice coffee ? you should drink workjuice coffee ! ad-man 1 : that is mostly what we would do ! knowing and nothing , knowing and ... nothing . and we would age , grow , and gray at the exact same rate and to the exact same height . and then , one day , we would all be gone . all at once . and no one would have to be sad , or miss anyone . ad-man 2 : i ca not move my arms . i ca not feel my body ! what is on this script ?

carlos : uh , i know exactly what it is . yeah , i ' ve , um , i ' ve written papers . sparks : all right . carlos : um , not about , uh , whatever this place is ... sparks : mars . carlos : ... specifically , yeah , but ... you know , still . papers . about things . sparks : ok , but you know it ' s a place . claxon : it ' s a planet , you ignoramuses ! cecil : no , my very efficient city council gave us nine prophesied ... no pe . i do not ... i do not know what it is . samuel : well , it ai not not one , that ' s for sure . dan : well , he ai not wrong . rowdy ! nice man dan . cecil : oh h ! you seem nice ! sparks : yeah , listen you ... you all seem nice , all right ? cecil seems really nice here , but ... you understand , i ca not allow you to be in our time . you ' ve likely got past germs all over you , stuff we eradicated generations ago , like , uh , i do not know , help me out . dan : sinus infections ... sparks : si – yes , sure . cecil : um , i ' m rattling ly me disease . sparks : what is that ? dan : you know space ly me disease ? sparks : sure . dan : ly me disease is the past version of it . i ' m a history buff . sparks : oh . carlos : of diseases exclusively ? dan : and maladies . i made a drama i called germs : then and now . if anyone wants to see a drama . steve : all right , just ... hold up , all right ? now , how do we know that you guy s do not all have future germs ? you know , like , stuff we do not even know about ? little roots the size of your cells , that flow through your blood stream like teeny tiny construction workers ... it us ? that ' s probably what they call it ? i bet ? coach : it is designate na h nohtek , and it exists within all of the glorious people , and it is glorious . steve : i was right ? cecil : yes , shut up , steve carlsberg . nobody asked you , and nobody ever will . coach : i possess no affection for the human designate steve carlsberg . steve : i can hear you ... cecil : yes ! steve : ... bud dy ! coach : i am not your bud dy . emily : hey , hey , everyone ? moon ' s still disappearing . catastrophe ai not averted ! cecil : oh , my gosh . this is embarrassing . steve : it ' s not our fault . coach : it is somewhat your fault . carlos : mostly it ' s the scientific ally fascinating root ' s fault ! samuel : are you pointing ' certain fingernails and their friends fingers at us , intima tin ' we ' re disappearing the moon , while simultaneously rubbing ' in the fact that i ai not got no fingers ' pal ' s hands , due to the marshal shooting ' ' em off me ? emily : if it ' s their fault , reckon i know who to shake until they stop wrecking ' my moon ! sparks : all right , no no no no . i ' m handling this , marshal . emily : my moon ' s in peril , marshal ! sparks : and i ' m taking care of it , marshal . emily : not yet you ' re not ! we ' re streaming ourselves over , marshal ! sparks : no , do not come here ! it ' s go n na be too crowded ... emily : initiate a stream , deputy county ! del ores county : rowdy , everyone . deputy del ores county . sparks : rowdy . del ores : i am a coburg , rowdy . deputy del ores county , from the moon , rowdy . claxon : pleasure . samuel : pleasure . coach : rowdy . del ores : deputy del ores county , hello . nice to meet you . deputy del ores county , coburg from the moon ... del ores : del ores county , moon . emily : yeah , they got it . all right . wh oo ! it ' s crowded in here , marshal ! our marshal station on the moon is , uh , way roomier . sparks : yeah , well you ai not probably got martians , local folk , root outlaws , time travelers , cyborgs , and moon marshals crowding ' it up . emily : uh-huh . uh , yeah , we got one fewer , one fewer , uh , three fewer , two fewer , and ... same , and same . round whereabouts . sparks : yeah . dan : tell you what , it is feeling ' crowded , and i ca not see what i ' m adding to this situation , nor what felt on adds ... felt on : hey ! dan : so , uh , well , what say i take him for a drink at the saloon ? that d be two of us out of your hair . sparks : oh , i can not stay mad at you , nice man dan ! marshal station ai : the marshal station doors are open . sparks : all right , now dr . carlos is saying it ' s these roots to blame for the earth moon falling apart , right ? cecil : well , you see , in night vale , a civic committee for public holidays and private silent weeping for no reason you can name was formed , and they sponsored the first annual destroy the moon festival . sparks : destroy the moon ? what , with like , bombs ? cecil : no oo ... sparks : a really big ... really big gun ? carlos : uh , eh ... not exactly . sparks : a bunch of ... really small guns ? how ' re we do in ' this ? cecil : um , well ? we threw things at it . emily : huh . i ' m from the moon , fell , and i do not think that could destroy it . cecil : ooh ! uh , we also called it names . steve : and ... and we generally insulted it . cecil : mmm-hmm . emily : that ai not go n na destroy my moon neither . sparks : and that do not explain why we hold these two responsible . claxon : with your fingers ! insult to injury . cecil : well , these two roots were the aforementioned civic committee . sparks : wait a se c . how is that even possible ? samuel : that ai not possible ! carlos : everything ai not ai not possible always . possibility is manifest in every corner of the void of our reality . claxon : i ai not in the past ! i ' m here . where i am . samuel : yeah , me too ! maybe even more ' n him ! we do not even have the means to time travel , let alone know in ' what to do when we get there . carlos : i mean , you could have stolen someone else ' s personal temporal shift beam generations . cecil : yeah , sure , they ' re everywhere . i mean , i ' ve got one here in my fanny pack . del ores : now what ' s that , an external fanny pack ? cecil : wait ... you have an internal one ? del ores : yeah . coburg ... so , uh ... cecil : oh . that must be nice . del ores : hey , yours is nice , too . probably easier to access , and colourful . i like it . cecil : thank you . carlos : i tell him he looks like a baby boomed mo m out on a cruise vacation . coach : all right . emily : if you say so . del ores : whatever rocks your boat . sparks : i do not know , decadence and all , it sounds like a contemporary reference . it is lost on us . claxon : well , the fact it ' s on the outside of you , just dangling ' a temporal shift generation in there means it is ripe for the stealing ' . or would be , for somebody with the hands to do it . sparks : yeah , you do not have any . samuel : i got hands . watch ! cecil : no ! my fanny pack ! samuel : here we go ! sparks : what ... happened ? emily : they ' re still here . samuel : uh , we ai not . we ' re back . claxon : ai not never thought setting ' up a civic committee could be such a laugh ! remember that one fell ? ` ` ooh , my name is hiram mcdaniels ! ooh , i ' m a five-headed dragon and i ' ve got plans for night vale too ! heh-heh-heh ! '' cecil : you know , that ' s exactly what he sounds like . samuel : we did not let him join , for obvious reasons . claxon : that one head . samuel : ugh . so we all was right . we set in motion events to disappear the moon . and that ai not all . claxon : bye-bye , marshal ! sparks : bye-bye mary me ? claxon : no ! emily : hey ! hey , i ' m ... i ' m disappearing ! del ores : marshal stalwart ! emily : wh – what ' s happening to me ? claxon : oh , we made some adjustments to the timeline . capriciously , i admit , but , uh , we just wanted to see if ' n they d take . samuel : we fixed it so ' s you ' re no longer the winner of the lottery-filled bloodshot in which you made your name : beating the caste system by being the last kid standing in a lethal game of intramural soccer . emily : but ... but if ' n i did not win the punishment soccer , then that means i ... i lost . i died . claxon : bye , little human with girl chromosomes ! emily : now i remember . lucky side tackle jessica ! nice having known you , nevada . coach . only i ... i did not . sparks : all right , you two are super under arrest . time crimes ai not misdemeanors . cecil : actually , in night vale , they ' ve been downgraded to infractions . sparks : infractions ? cecil : they were barely worth the citation for most met er readers . sparks : oh h ! samuel : and we ' re back ! sparks : now what ? claxon : see how i ' m waving ' at you , nevada ? sparks : yeah . claxon : i got my hands back ! samuel : yeah , hey ! hey ! i got one . we should , uh , ... claxon : oh ! good one ! samuel : cecil : oh my ! sparks : oh no ! what ' s the matter , did they kill you too ? cecil : no , i– i– i– i do not know how to bowl anymore ! and i do not even know what bowl ing is ! you monsters ! claxon : sam bolt ? what you want to do to nevada ? sparks : all right , not so fast . citizens of night vale have temporal shift generations , right ? cecil : um , night vale . and yes . sparks : all right . give me yours , steve carlsberg . steve : uh , i ... i ca not . cecil : give it to him , steve carlsberg ! steve : no , no no , i– i want to , but i always displace it , so i left it at home for safe keeping . all : oh , steve carlsberg ! sparks : carlsberg ! del ores : enough ! all right , i am still here , and without marshal stalwart having lived to be my boss , i am an ornery cuss . sparks : and why is that ? del ores : you want me to explain the particulars of the space time continuity , or you want me to show you what it means ? sparks : uhhhhhhhhhh ... honestly ? del ores : suffice it to say , chicky sullivan won a real big star war , and he ' s currently emperor of the universe , and i expect the only reason you ai not a coburg right now is he likes you . sparks : yeah , ok , one thing at a time . claxon : space time continuity makes my head hurt . samuel : yeah . i do not even know what y'all are talking about , and i ai not interested in learning about it nor discuss in ' it any further . reckon i only aim to shoot this deputy for confusing everything something ' powerful . del ores : go ahead and try . samuel : my guns ! where d they get to ? del ores : oh , they got to me destroying ' them . i got my own time travel te ch ca not be stolen nor destroyed , se ein ' it ' s part of me . claxon : we did not even hear you shift ! del ores : had it set to silent . sparks : silent . del ores : you see , without balance brought by the things that were , i shifted forward in time a ways to upgrade my intelligence and system op s . sparks : oh , i do not understand what one thing has to do with the other . del ores : you would not . sparks : mean . carlos : um , if i may , i think it ' s about balance out of balance , going to ... you know , she who seeks balance for herself . del ores : that ' s exactly right ! sometimes it takes a past man to tell a future man the present . cecil : i could not have said it better myself ! and if i could have , i would not have , because it would have been illegal to do so . sparks : what ? samuel : well , i aim to shift to before you did it and ... why ai not my shift er working ' ? del ores : austin ' up your guns and time shift er ai not all i did . cecil : hey ! bowl ing ! yes ! i remember it , and i love it ! emily : there was ... darkness . nothing ' . and ... numbers . i remember an endless stream of random numbers . ♫ i am a ... champion , ♫ ♪ and ... you ' re go n na hear me roar ! ♪ sparks : all right , marshal stalwart . let ' s shut these roots down , permanently . del ores : not yet , marshal . sparks : what ? del ores : we destroy them now , and the moon ' ll just keep on disappearing ' . they ai not who caused its destruction . nor is it the people of night vale . cecil : are you sure ? because our insults were very cutting . sparks : all right , what is it , deputy ? what ' s causing the moon to disappear ? del ores : well , me . paradol due to undoing ' what i undone but still have the upgrade caused by the undone things having ' been done . uh-oh . ugh . now that the balance is being restored , i ' m becoming the fulcrum of the paradol . along with the moon . cecil : two fulcrums ? del ores : because i ' m from the moon . cecil : i do not understand . carlos : that has the shape and sound of science , i am sure it all makes sense and anyone listening would recognize it as a completely logical explanation . felt on : marshal ! marshal ! heeelllp ! marshal station ai : the marshal station doors are open . felt on : nice man dan and i were over drinking ' at the space saloon . an alarm went off due to the situation on earth ' s moon , causing a galaxy-wide domingo effect ! not nearly as fun as an actual game of dominoes ! but very far ! throughout the galaxy ! balance and ... bless you ! and ... balance and order are canceled ! dan : looks like the end times . got ta say , when i thought of dy in ' , i always knew it d be something like this . cecil : you always knew it would be due to earth ' s moon disappearing and causing intergalactic turmoil ? dan : y up . cecil : me too ! sparks : well , i guess if ' n this is really the end , then ... i ' m glad to be surrounded by all y'all . 'cept you two . steve : oh , come on , we just met ! sparks : i was talking about the roots , but yeah , you three . carlos : hey , uh , cecil ? if this is the last conversation we have , then let ' s just ... not have it . i mean , let ' s just remember every conversation we ' ve had in our lives , going back . cecil : i remember every one . coach : sparks nevada , it pains me that i shall perish while still under on us to you . sparks : consider it a wash coach : i can not . that is not how on us works . sparks : coach ? your on us to me would be fulfilled if you d agree that serving ' together had been one adventure after another . coach : i agree to that . sparks : and , you ' ve been , and ... well , you ' ve been and are my ... just my total ... my ... my best ... ffffff ... you are my ... best ff f ... coach : your best what , sparks nevada ? sparks : i ' m doing it . i ' m doing it . u mm . you are ... my ... steve : you ' re my best friend , cecil ! sparks : what ? cecil : wait , me ? really ? carlos : him ? steve : well ... well , yeah . cecil : i– oh ! i ... sparks : all right . no no no , coach , it ' s just that ... that is to say , coach , you are ... you are my best ... coach : what are you expressing , sparks nevada ? emily : deputy , you ' re my best friend ! del ores : oh , and you ' re mine too , pe m ! sparks : no , hang on ! emily : i love you ! del ores : i love you ! sparks : ok , let ' s not ... ok . coach , i just ... coach : sparks nevada . i possess a single emotion . and it is known as ... stone : hello ! i am stone . of the galaxium ? sparks : oh , thank goodness . stone : i ' ve been watching what ' s been happening with this great crossover , and i ca not just watch any longer . cecil : you ' ve just been hanging out , watching our world about to end ? stone : i am of the galaxium . we ' re a tireless , and comic – cosmically-powered race . comical ly , too . chemically comically-powered race . we are forbidden to interfere with the events of the universe . sparks : yeah , well , i un-forbid you . it totally ai not against the law . stone : no , i know , it ' s more of an infraction . sparks : infraction ? emily : oh , i ' m feeling ' a whole lot of bloodless towards this guy . think i ' m go n na shoot him . del ores : do not ! i ... i know stone of the galaxium due to all my upgrade that are killing me , the moon , and everything . stone , you have the force lactic , the comic energies that make up the make up of everything . stone : y up . but i am un allowed to use them . as i said . apparently i ' m allowed to repeat myself . del ores : but ... you could do it , could not you ? you could defy your ... what , law ? stone : more of a local ordinance . sparks : all right , well , then do it . yeah , do it . defy the neck out of it , i ' ll take what comes . stone : i do not know ... cecil : um , stone , is it ? stone : stone ? you pronounced my name correctly ! cecil : yes . stone , now , if you can help us , do ! we need you to . we humans and ... coach : i have simulated the clearing of the single human esophageal tract to draw attention to the fact that i am not human . samuel : uh , us neither . cecil : uh , of course . um , beings , then . we beings really like ... well , being . um , it – it ' s right in the name . emily : i ' ve tasted enough death today , let alone in my life . i do not welcome no more . steve : yeah , without living , there d be no friendship . carlos : no love . cecil : no bowl ing . sparks : no paperwork . coach : no sparks nevada . sparks : what ? stone : you beings , i am moved . it ' s been a long time since i ' ve been moved . felt on : so you ' ll do it ? you ' ll help us ? stone : i am moved by sparks nevada ' s bravery . sparks : you ... are welcome . stone : by cecil gershwin palmer ' s heart . cecil : thank you , and there is quite a bit of blood in it ... um , more than i am comfortable admitting . sparks : i also got heart , so ... stone : not as much . sparks : definitely as much . stone : more bravery . definitely more bravery than heart . sparks : disagree . stone : i ' m moved by the tenacity of emily stalwart , by the science of carlos the scientist . by the skepticism of steve carlsberg . by the nice of nice man dan . dan : you ai not so bad yourself . stone : by your healthy fear , felt on . felt on : thanks . stone : and by the funny orneriness of this one root . claxon : d'aww , shut up . stone : by the fact that this other one is a really good drummer . claxon : you are ? i did not know ! samuel : well ... y you never asked . stone : by your beauty , del ores county . del ores : beauty ? really ? stone : you may be the most beautiful creature in the galaxy . del ores : ugh . yeah , i mean , thanks , i guess . heap of other qualities by which i choose to define myself , but , uh , you choose my looks . that ' s ... telling ' . stone : it is my desire that you become my comic bride . del ores : this is sudden . stone : not to me . sparks : it is , uh ... it is pretty sudden . del ores : stone , if i decline ... stone : i definitely wo not save your universe . all : del ores : now ... now , if ' n you wanted to save everything so we could date a bit , see how things go , well , i d be up for that . stone : will you marry me , and have a universe ? yes or no ? sparks : um , say yes . that is my advice . say yes . del ores : well now , you ' re omniscience , you already know my answer . sparks : is it yes ? is it ? is it yes ? stone : i do not know , actually . i ' m being respectful . laying a solid groundwork for this relationship . del ores : by blackmailing me with the fate of the universe ? stone : by not peeking . del ores : the answer ... is ... no . stone : fine . have a good end of the universe , you guy s . sparks : seriously ? sparks : that ended poorly . steve : what was wrong with that guy ? sparks : yeah , that was bad . steve : i mean ... del ores : love is what was wrong with him . sparks : yeah , the bad kind of love . how long anyone reckon we got ? claxon : end ' s starting ' . my ocular sensory are telling me the moon ' s nearly gone . emily : oh , dumb old time traveling ' ! nothing ' good never came from it . sparks and cecil : wait ... claxon and steve : what ? sparks : if ' n too much time travel caused this disaster ... cecil : then it stands to reason that we can fix it the same way . coach : that is unsound reasoning . carlos : yeah . and that makes no scientific sense . cecil : no , listen , it does ! sparks : it does . we still got time travel in our pocket , or deputy county ' s , more specifically . cecil : she can go back ! del ores : yeah , but if i go back , i ' ll destroy everything ! sparks : unless you go to before this all happened ... cecil : and stop it all from ever happening . cecil : that was my very first high five ! sparks : well , you are great at it . cecil : thank you ! steve : wait , wait , wait ! if that happens , then none of us would ever have met ! cecil : i am 100 % ok with that . sparks : none taken . all right , let ' s do it . and by ` ` let ' s , '' i mean ` ` you . '' del ores : yeah . yeah , i think i can do that . but ... i may never come back . marshal stalwart , may i tender my resignation ? carlos : guy s ! this wo not work , according to science , ok ? if no one ' s going to listen to science , i ' m just going to project myself back into the otherworld desert dimension , where i live . ok ?

dan : well , there you go . i lured these root outlaws here to be destroyed for the bounty . sparks : so ... wait , you two are working together ? del ores : i come from a possible future , marshal nevada . and now i have prevented that future . sparks : yeah , ok , i ' m just go n na take that at face value . dan : so you ai not interested in the bounty ? del ores : then the bounty ' s mine ! use it to open up a shoe business , i reckon . sparks : all right ! i ' ll fill out the paperwork . credit should be in your account by end of business today . marshal station ai : the marshal station doors are open . coach : i also will leave . sparks : for good , then ? coach : yes . i shall depart . unless you are somehow responsible for the coburg having prevented a destructive future . sparks : i ' m ... sure i ' m not . del ores : um , you kind of were . sparks : uh , no , uh , uh , no . i ' m sure it was not that destructive of a future . del ores : eh h , universe-ending level destructive . sparks : yeah , yeah , yeah . uh , i ' m sure you did most of the work . del ores : based on your idea ! sparks : oh , come on ! coach : then i am under great on us to you , sparks nevada . i will discern just how great via an accounting of what occurred . del ores : and then afterwards , reckon i ' ll go to the moon and resume deploying . except ... there ' s another me doing my job . the me that never left . i do not wan na start parading again . ugh . if i could do anything , what would i do ?

'' the night vale seismological society said . this just in : there ' s news breaking of a possible scandal involving one of the night vale football players . senior running back maliq herr era , according to an investigation report by leann hart of the night vale daily journal , herr era does not actually exist . like , he ' s right there when you look at him , and he plays in a team of other players , so it would make more sense for him to be there than not . but , hart claims in her report that the all-district running back is , in fact , completely abdicated . anonymous sources say that herr era is collectively imagined by the night vale high school fan base – a shared dream , in the form of a boy who won the district rushing title the past two years , and was fresh man of the year three seasons ago . red me sa is threatening to cancel this friday ' s game if night vale does not bench herr era , biting district league rule 12 , article 6 , that states : ` ` all players must be real people . do not not be a person , ok ? '' the rule continues , ` ` because if you ' re not really real , man , i ' m mad just thinking about it ! '' night vale high school head coach nazr al-mujaheed said they will not bench any player until a full investigation is performed , which ca not happen until tuesday – maybe monday at the earliest . coach al-mujaheed then concluded the statement by removing his goat-horned headpiece and comical ly large sun glasses , revealing tattoo of cat eyes on his eyelids . ` ` coooool , '' the gathered reporter shouted . night vale ? if there ' s no game , there ' s no homecoming . if there ' s no homecoming , we will miss the one chance we have this year to see our lost loved ones ! i will miss the chance to talk to my mother ! to see many of my friends ! to ... get out , for once , and ... not feel so lonely . we will not have our biggest night of the year to come together as a community . i hope this scandal is not true . and , if it is , that it does not ... you know , ruin anything . well , there is at least one old friend i ' ll get to see . listeners , i ' m so excited for this next segment ! my old friend earl harlan is in the studio today . earl is the new sous chef at night vale ' s hottest new restaurant , tourniquet . and he ' s here to teach us a simple and delicious dessert recipe . welcome , earl . earl : it ' s good to see you again , cecil . it ' s been a long time . cecil : many of you listening may not know this , but earl and i grew up together . we fell out of touch for a while , and then he was taken to another world during a boy scout ceremony . but i recently saw his name in the news re leases about tourniquet . earl : we were very close friends . cecil : we were , earl . what happened after high school ? i completely lost track of you . earl : well , i turned 19 , and then i was 19 for a long time . i do not even know how long . i was 19 for longer than i care to admit , and then one day , i was suddenly a grownup . i had a kid , and a house , and a job . cecil : some of us mature early , some of us mature late . it sounds like you had plenty of youth left to live after high school , and you just ... came to adulthood later . earl : cecil , i meant that literally . i was literally 19 for ... oh , i think it was decades . maybe a century , or more ? i do not know exactly how long . cecil , we graduated the same year , right ? cecil : yeah , of course we did ! i remember our granulation party . we drank an entire case of warm orange milk , and told dirty jokes about the moon , until we were frightened off by the sunrise . earl : what year was that ? cecil ? what year did we graduate ? you do not remember , do you , cecil ? cecil : so , tell us about your recipe , earl ! earl : ok , sure thing . tiramisu is a popular dessert at many restaurant – especially at tourniquet – but few people make it at home . once they hear how easy it is , and how delicious chef mason ' s recipe is , they ' ll want to make it all the time . they ' ll want to never stop making tiramisu . cecil : oooh , sounds good ! earl : never stop making it ! cecil : ohio . earl : they ' ll lose their minds making it , cecil ! cecil : so ... what all do you have here ? what will our listeners need ? earl : well , everyone should have most of these ingredient already at home . a caraffe of pre-made coffee , six eggs – go ahead and separate them into whites and folks , but make sure to remove organs , teeth , and other debris – uh , salt , two tablespoons of cocoa , 1/3 cup of sugar , two cups of marscapone , which is a kind of fish , a package of gluten-free ladyfinger colonies , two ounces of dark rum , and – chef mason ' s special urinary touch – one and a half cups of ground nut meg . cecil : ohhh ! i do love nut meg . oh ... it ' s been deveined , right ? earl : yes . you can buy deveined nut meg at most supermarket , but in case you ' re grinding it fresh at home , make sure to remove the thick vein running up the nut meg spine after you kill and clean the animal . to start , just whisky the egg folks and ¼ cup of the sugar in one bowl , and then work in the marscapone . then , in a separate bowl , you ' ll want to mix the egg whites , a pinch of salt , and the remaining sugar until firm , like this . cecil : that looks easy ! earl : it is ! mix that into the first bowl , and add the coffee and the rum . then , dip the colonies into the mixture , lay them into a baking dish , cover with your ground nut meg , and ... cecil : oh , dear , earl ? i feel so silly saying this , but ... there ' s no oven here . ugh . i brought a professional chef to do a recipe on my show , and i do not even have a working kitchen ! earl : relax , cecil . we would not have time to completely cook a tiramisu on the air ! it takes hours of slow baking in an earth oven . i already brought a finished tiramisu ! cecil : earl ! how sweet of you ! oh , this looks delicious ! i ca not wait to share it with the staff . earl : be careful , it is quite poisonous . cecil : oh , yes , of course . well , thanks for coming on the show , and congratulations on the huge success of tourniquet . i hope to get a reservation there soon ... will you come on the show again with more ta sty recipe ? maybe we can make this a regular cooking feature . earl : i d love to , cecil . i think we really have something here . cecil : me too ! and now , a word from our sponsors . today ' s program is brought to you by staples . staples has the largest collection of office supplies anywhere . from printer ton er to paperclips , staples has everything you could possibly ever want to run your business . just imagine it ! imagine your office . a great mahogany desk , with ornate leg carving depicting old gods , a crisp new suit , and high-backed chair made of rare animal hide . imagine a workforce that has all it needs to succeed . imagine an open floor plan , allowing you the freedom to see the stars , which geometrical describe the shapes of old gods . you wail to the stars . you howl your strategic plan to the stars . the old gods like your presentation . you smell prey . follow the blood scent . imagine the distant cries of your colleagues baying beneath moonlight pin es , their teeth glistening with hunger . imagine tearworn . imagine a business running at its most efficient . imagine a lone deer , t rapped against a wild stream . a wounded leg . nowhere to run . surrounded , it will fight ... but your business will fight harder . you have everything you need . plus , there ' s that refreshing stream for a cold drink when you are through with this gory work . staples . worship old gods . terrible news , listeners ! just ... terrible news . red me sa high school has called off friday night ' s game . there will be no homecoming . the capers and r vs that had started to fill up the night vale stadium parking lot have begun to file out . maliq herr era , the running back accused of a false existence , apologized for not being more transparent , and for letting down his school and community . the night vale school board forced the team ' s hand by suspending herr era for his corporal reality , but ... it was too late . the game had already been forfeited . our homecoming is no more . i had ... i had so much i wanted to say to my mother ! i imagine all of you had so much you wanted to say to your lost loved ones , to ... to say to each other . i imagine all that could ' ve been , and all that is now lost . our biggest community event of the year is gone , perhaps because we imagined too much . and , to make things worse , a , um ... a dangerous storm front is moving right now into night vale . you should seek shelter immediately from the imminent rain , and as a duty of public safety , i must take you now to the weather . it ' s been five days , night vale , since that weather report began . it was a historically massive storm , and we needed the on going weather coverage . i hope you are all ok . i ' m looking at some of you right now , and you seem just fine , so ... that ' s good news . sadly , the homecoming game remained canceled . league officials conducted an investigation into maliq herr era ' s reality and determined he was indeed not real . they said he was tangible , they could feel a body when they touched him , they could hear a voice when they spoke with him . they could see a boy when they looked at him . but red me sa co aching staff presented , as evidence , a photograph of the many salaries of our universe . and , after viewing this , league officials determined that herr era was too immeasurably small to be considered real . coach al-mujaheed argued that it is unfair to discriminate against someone based on their reality . just because someone does not exist , does not mean they do not deserve equal rights , equal pursuit of happiness . even if al-mujaheed and herr era ' s appeal holds up in the league , it ca not bring back the homecoming we did not get to have . we did not get to see our dead friends and relatives this year , night vale . we had unanswered questions . we had unfulfilled hug s . we had unacknowledged ` ` i miss you s . '' we did not get to cry that night the way we wanted to cry that night , night vale . the way that , perhaps , we want to cry every night . and even if there had been a game , the rain from the weekend was so monstrous and so intense that it would have been postponed anyway . there would have been no halftime in that deluge . but , in spite of all this , coach al-mujaheed called a pe p rally last friday , in a gesture of support for maliq herr era . this – as any time – is when we should join as a town . despite the game that never was . students and alum ni , unfortunately only those still living , met that night in a rainy parking lot in the well-lit shadow of an empty football stadium . and we told stories . nez cordova told me about her son , who has started to walk ! teddy williams told me he finally rolled a 450 in bowl ing ! wilson levy and amber aquini whispered the story of their vacation to luftnarp last spring ! i told my friend diane creighton about carlos , and how much i miss him , but how proud i am of the great work he is doing . and diane introduced me to her son , josh , who is a monarch butterfly . and later , when i saw him , he was a motorbike . aww , he ' s a sweet kid , that josh . everyone was sad , and everything was perfect . we stayed late into the night under the fluorescent corona of the bleachers , eating damp barbecue , wearing our orange pouches and telling those tales we wanted to tell to those loved ones who have left us . telling them instead to those who we currently , or may eventually , love . tears were hardly noticeable on our rain-streaked cheeks by the time we said our goodby . ` ` goodby ! '' we all said . ` ` you too ! '' we all replied . ` ` oh ! let ' s stay in touch ! '' we all added , with wildly varying levels of intention . before getting into my car , i saw maliq herr era standing alone , wearing a full football uniform ... shoulder pads , knee spikes , and all . i told him he ' ll be playing again soon , and we ' re all on his side . even though he ' s just a pigment of our collective unconscious . he said , ` ` i do not even like football , sir . '' he said he likes painting and bound poetry . i told him he could be an artist , if he wanted . ` ` only if the town imagines that for me , '' he said . ` ` ah h . well , you ' re a real trooper , '' i told him . ` ` hm m . just a trooper , '' he said . ` ` i ' m not real . i got ta get to practice now , mr . palmer . '' then he put on his helmet and jagged away . ` ` but ... it ' s 2:00am ! '' i called out . but he had already vanished into the unrelenting storm . ` ` it sure is , sir ! '' he called back faintly in my mind . i fell asleep easily that night . i dreamed of sun , of being with carlos again , of a lighthorse that was not a lighthorse . of a world that is not anything at all . perhaps a dream of things yet to come . huh . stay tuned next for a radio program that only dogs can hear . and as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : i ' ve got more rhymes than the bible ' s got psalms . 151. i ' ve got 151 rhymes .

'' in a small , childlike voice . faculty began to shift and turn in their seats , but saw nothing . this continued until it was decided that the president had nothing further to offer , and dr . szabo picked up the president and placed her back in her terrarium . item 5 : announcements , issues , and questions ( a ) : an update on fresh man seminar dr . laredo , who took over the fresh man seminar two years ago , because of dr . joel eisneberg ' s extended medical leave , described a number of revisions to the program , which she hopes to implement with the faculty ' s support , including standardizing grading rubrics , working carefully with the library to develop some non-violent literacy programs , possibly reassessing the requirement of plague masks for all fresh man , and increasing focus on real-world career skill like running , hiding , and covering their faces with their hands , moaning ` ` oh no ! oh no ! '' quietly . ( b ) : the unending halfway on the second floor of the earth sciences building dr . hernandez provided an update on facility ' s progress with the unending halfway situation . apparently the halfway is now fully finite in breadth . and while it still appears to be infinite in length , the fact that it no longer swallow light itself indicates that this is merely due to the limits of human perception , and the halfway does now possess and end . somewhere . however , according to the director of facilities services , all available measuring equipment is still inadequate to chart the length of the halfway , and the reading that have been made indicate that it would take at least six human lifetime to traverse the full length of the halfway . so , ultimately , the distinction is negligible . administrators and faculty are still advised not to schedule classes on the second floor of earth sciences until the situation is resolved , unless class size exceeds the available facilities , and students have been cautioned to bring enough food and water to last them the rest of their lives . © : standards revision for honors courses dr . hertzwell announced that as of registration for the spring smelter , while the minimum grade point average of 3.0 and sat score of 1100 have not been changed , students are now no longer required to be fully human to en roll in honors courses . dr . hertzwell applaud ed this progressive change , but lamented that it took so long to make it happen . faculty advisers of students who are arthropods , malevolent spirits , or tangible dream-people should recommend application to these advanced courses . ( d ) : repeated fires in the computer science laboratory professor gwozdecke reported that public safety officers have completed their preliminary investigation of the repeated and unexplained fires in the main computer lab . the officers suspect that cause to be arson but , as professor gwozdecke pointed out , they are liar . filthy , disgusting , pestilential liar , who should be embarrassed to tell those kinds of lies where people can hear their crazy nonsense . and , at the very least , they should all be fired . meaning , set on fire . but also meaning terminated . meaning , an end brought to their lives . but also meaning fired from their jobs . ` ` at the very least , '' she added . she then set a rug on fire with her thoughts . item 6 : welcome for dr . buqar dr . szabo asked the assembled to welcome dr . moving buqar , who joined the faculty as an assistant professor of secret english at the beginning of the spring smelter . dr . buqar , sweating profusely with a fixed grin that showed far too many of her teeth , greeted the faculty and briefly introduced herself and her interests in a shaky , indistinct voice that gradually climbed in pitch toward a shriek . dr . buqar ' s doctor al dissertation compared shakespeare ' s un produced and un published play , mirth forest , with elements of chaucer ' s unwritten childhood daydreams . and she enjoys ballroom dance and owns two siberian hussies . she is teaching two sections of survey of secret british literature , featuring emily bronze ' s epic novel that no one has ever heard of , the flippancy of clouds . item 7 : new course proposals for fall 2015 humanities 375 – heel ' s philosophy in context , taught by dr . szabo computer science 180 – fort ran programming and flame resistance , taught by professor gwozdecke bio 351 – human closing and you and you , taught by dr . stone te ch 220 – blood stone installation and repair , taught by professor mzzzzrrnnnnwrrrnnnnn history 311 – history of post-war germany , taught by dr . brown alternative history 311 – history of underwater germany , taught by dr . crawford-rothwell music 208 – murder ballads , taught by professor norman un assigned course – oh god ! oh god , why ?

'' slogan 2 reads : ` ` find yourself here , with no memory of the previous week . '' slogan 3 reads : ` ` examine hydrochloride . '' if the slogans are approved by the faculty , the college community will vote on them at the next open camp us meeting , to be held on monday , february 23 rd . discussion : dr . long began vomiting and shudder ing uncontrollably near the end of ms kingsworth ' s presentation , although this was found to be unrelated . dr . szabo remarked on the exceptional artistry of the lo go , and insisted on taking a picture with his mobile phone on behalf of professor ga len in the art department , who was unable to attend today ' s meeting . the phone produced a small cloud of foul-smelling crystals from its camera lens , and then implored . dr . bell questioned whether the reference to ` ` ancestors '' in slogan 1 was cultural insensitive . ms kingsworth assured the faculty that the advertising firm understood the importance of diversity to the college community , and the inclusivity of the slogans as well as their market impact had been thoroughly re searched . dr s . crawford-rothwell and szabo debated the issue . no conclusion was reached , although ms kingsworth agreed to raise the issue with the firm as the process continued . dr . bell asked ms kingsworth for the name of the advertising firm the college is consulting . ms kingsworth was silent for seven full minutes , and then proceeded to giggler for the remainder of the meeting . dr . szabo distributed ballots for approval or disapproval of the slogans . additional copies will be mail ed to each department to be filled out by faculty members who were unable to attend today ' s meeting . no one will actually mail them – it will just happen , quietly , while no one is looking . the ballots should be completed and returned to the office of college relations , where they will be discarded unreal . action items : complete and return slogan approval ballot person responsible : all faculty item 12 : presentation tit led ` ` blood '' presented : blood summary : blood discussion : blood distant screeches , perhaps a crow of some kind . blood action items : cost/benefit analysis for expansion of student center person responsible : blood item 13 : presentation tit led ` ` tax information online '' presented : robert hernandez summary : dr . hernandez announced that tax information and forms for college employees for this year ' s tax season will be available online , through the employee self-service area of the college webster . he demonstrated , via protector , the location of the forms by navigation the webster . from the college homage , employees should go to the faculty and staff portal , then to the employee self-service link under the human resources header , then stroll down the page to the section marked pay roll , and click on the link reading tax forms . users will be shown a picture of a face . it will be a familiar face , but not one they will be able to comprehend or remember . they must maintain silent eye contact with this face . do not blink . do not speak . breathe , but slowly , and without purpose . after several seconds , perhaps minutes , the face will contort into a terrifying grimace as a cacophonous scream fills the room , echoing down the halls , freezing you in terror . then , you can download the appropriate form . discussion : dr . al-anizi asked whether the forms would still be distributed in paper form . dr . hernandez confirmed that they would , and the online and paper forms would be identical . mr . long mentioned that he thought computers might be illegal – but even if they ' re not , they require licenses . he asked if anyone had up-to-date computer licenses for the college . everyone else urgently hushed him , their eyes dashing left and right , fingers to their tight lips . dr . mills asked if any help was available for faculty and staff members who had forgotten their login information for the employee self-service area . dr . hernandez advised him to direct his query to the help desk , or to click on the link below the login form and answer the security question . ` ` you get one attempt , '' dr . hernandez said . ` ` one , '' he said again . ` ` one . you get one attempt . '' he repeated this for several minutes , the register of his voice growing lower and lower . action items : bury an owl feather , six human finger bones , and a mirror in a shallow hole at the base of the largest rock in the mountains , beneath the light of a quarter-full moon . tell no one . not even your family . the same night , place a stone under your tongue and wind a ribbon around your mouth until you can make no sound . sleep . you will dream of a tall , worried man , holding a rope . he will not speak to you , but he will point toward a doorway you do not recognize . it will be very very dark , and a faint cool breeze will blow forth , smelling faintly of copper and water . person responsible : robert hernandez item 14 : adjournment the faculty met eyes , placed hands upon arms upon shoulders . dr . szabo , weeping , adjourned the meeting at an unknown time , as time is subjective and confusing . in the flickering candlelight , their synchronously breath were a breezy metronome , marking the only time any of them could possibly understand . the light went out . and in the darkness , there was a dis comforting silence , followed by even more dis comforting scratching sounds . minutes submitted by : joshua white minutes approved by : the survivor , presumably today ' s proverb : if you ' re worried your writing is not good , just remember : the earth is warming and soon , good and bad writing alike will all be underwater .
WTNV|Well of Night|14 August 2015|what of the sea ? by marya rain er this happened , then this happened , then this happened . she got a potential invitation . it was stuck in between the mesh and tin brace of her screen door , with her name bodily hand-written on the front of the envelope . across the se am of the back of the envelope was written the crony s.w.a.c. , and no reference was made to its send er . sticky , wet letters . she stood at the entrance of her bungalow , plastic bags of recently-purchased groceries at her feet , and pondered , turning the envelope in her hands , and occasionally meeting her nose to it to sniff for clues , as to its origins . the air was too chilled to glean much information from it that way . it deafened the senses . it was meant to . sealed with a kiss , she knew , signing something s.w.a.k . but s.w.a.c. ? what did this c portend ? once a thing is opened , it can not be closed again , not really . has not that been proven time and time again in this town ? today ' s delivery flummoxed her , and she wondered if this letter reception was being stealthily observed . had the man in the ta n jacket been accounted for lately ? sometimes he was everywhere . but no one could remember for certain what he looked like , except he had a ta n jacket , and a bearskin suitcase – which was full of flies . had a librarian escaped ? sometimes they tried to lure prey by sending library cards to potential book lovers . in fact , there were periods this year where a librarian seemed to be escaping nearly every day . sealed with a card ? no . perhaps a vague , yet menacing , government agency ! or another political flies from the five-headed dragon hiram mcdaniels , or the careless old woman who secretly lived in her home . it could not be the former , as there were no scotch marks , and definitely not the latter , as the careless old woman mostly scrawled her messages on the in sides of closet doors , and in the margins of her municipally-required dream journal . it could have been innumerable letter writers . there were three hollow trees just on her block that someone could be hiding in . a limp careening overhead . an overturned car down the way . she ceased her conjecture . she had to get all the black garlic ice cream pints and paper towels into the freeze . she should put all these sun dries into the fridge and secure all her glassware before today ' s schedule earthquakes . she swiftly checked if other mail was waiting for her in its proper receptacle – none yet , but the potman anus may have been lollygagging or gagging full-stop en route – and ventured inside . the letter was most assuredly hand delivered . the door chased her backside with a uproarious schoomp ! , caught itself at the last minute , and politely bopped closed . sealed with a ... it might have been a misspelling , of course . perhaps the send er did in fact kiss it just after it was sealed . perhaps the send er took pleasure in imagining her guessed up in her aubergine dress and kitten heels , tights with line designs , a crocheted shawl , her froofy hat , and wielding a mottled cane – which she did not need , but enjoyed the feeling of swagger that it provided – and also , glasses framing her green eyes . contact lenses always seemed to rebel against their function in her eyeball , like fire . fire . but , specifically , her dazzled cat-eye frames , rather than her everyday br owns . and also , eye make up . she smiled at that image of herself in her brain , which was much more acceptable than the untrustworthy image of herself in the mirror . she hoped the content of the envelope would be revealed to be an invitation to a party , where such a get up would be appropriate . it had been three weeks on a rigid diet of black garlic ice cream and sun dries : apples , de li mustard , goat ' s eggs , et cet era . you know it . and she was seeing results . trend diets be darned ! if a thing works , a thing works . and this thing works . sometimes things are trend for a reason , she justified . s.w.a.c . perhaps the send er meant k , for kiss , because the act of their lips meeting with the paper had already taken place , but then they were so overwhelmed by their vision of her that their hand briefly did not work ? but ... it could have been from an unfriendly rival . or a vindictive ex . it could have been from a genetically overachieving combat , with orthographic training and questionable spelling . what did that c portend ? sealed with a compliment ? a consonant ? a cart on of blue ? a car touche ? a ca rat , as in gold ? a carrot , as in vegetable ? a century ' s worth of spite ? sealed with a charm . aah , a charm ! and if so , should she open this at all ? fool me once , she thought , as she filled the freeze with the packed pints , reserving one out on the counter for immediate attention , from which she coax ed the plastic top and found a tin spoon where it should be , in the silverware drawer – which is always directly above the hot milk drawer . she had a series of bites and thoughts , pressing the ice cream about her mouth . what if , in the opening , something ... horrendous would get unleashed , and all the fleeting thoughts that flashed in her brain that day would come to fruition ? as an example . and so , what did she think today ? she thought about potman anus , lollygagging or gagging . that was a fairly recent thought . and , once remembered , it lingered . in her mind , he had spotted a wallflower blooming on , say , the old band era lot , and became consumed with picking it for his tincture . he would fish his wire cutters from his mail bag , clip an angus-sized hole in the wire fence , and squeeze himself through to gain his treasure . she thought about how her letters would often come stained with pollen , as they increasingly shared the postal bag with this roving apothecary in the making . and how , once , an inchworm sat up from its self-claimed letter bed when she opened a bill from her podiatrist , as if she had disturbed its slumber . she thought about the last letter she got from her sister , who lived a block over , but had impulse-purchased reams of victorian-inspired stationary from a door-to-door salesdeer , and now wrote anyone about anything , just to regain her living room space . the letter was sticky with tree sap , and her sister had scribbled ` ` wait , what did you say ? '' and what she had said , on a previous day , in a previous month , sitting across from her sister as they shared an afternoon cocoa and rye toast ( pre wheat ban ) , was ` ` a green-blue ring . '' her sister ' s letters were confusing , because they were written in immediate response to a conversation , but posted in a big batch at the end of each day , and since the time of the post office ' s vacuum portal , which demotivated its swallowed staff , were received sporadically , out of order , and in poor condition . the letters were therefore work to comprehend , and sometimes she thought about not reading them , then worried that she might miss one that truly was a complete letter , thoughtfully craft ed by her sister about an intimate issue , and not a rhetoric ` ` what ? '' or ` ` excuse me ? '' or a query about what song or brand of tea this is , or an supported rebuttal point long lost to chronological context . she would not want to miss the rare , real letter . they were close , the two sisters . they took a trip together last year to a facial lake , and did not come home with stories or tans , but lots of digital pictures of birds . people asked them , ` ` was not there any sunshine , or lovely scenery ? did you get out on a paddle boat once , at least ? '' ` ` birds , '' the sisters said . ` ` we saw incredible birds . '' c. s.w.a.c . the letter took on more ominous importance with each spoonfuls . she brought the massive , now warmer and violently ( violently ) more fragrant , and the ice cream pint , now warmer too , over to the sleeper sofa , and placed both on the adjacent coffee table . she could feel a change in the weather . she felt it in her knees , and in her hair . the mystery of the envelope weighed on her chest and eyelids , and she felt burdened by the responsibility of the unknown consequences of investigation the epistle ' s in sides . was any societal gathering worth the dark magic its acceptance could unfurled ? is not magic just a fiction ? is not society ? did nice people need cs ? she did not appreciate it , nor did she want it . she took the straight end of the spoon and slid it underneath the slight separation between gum-shut seal and folded corner . the spoon fit perfectly . she contemplated the slight lift of her elbow , the outward flick of her arm and carpal follow through , a gesture which would send the tin spoon through the paper ' s protective . – or secretive – crease . what c would be revealed ? or released ? the spoon slid out carefully , the crease unarmed . gathering all her gusto , she instead reached under the sofa bed and found her st ash of writing utensils . they were illegal , yes , but everyone had them . secret police rarely wrote tickets for pencil possession . she was careful . and , more than careful , she was private . and , more than private , she was ... discreet . she touched the tip of her tongue , then to her block printed name on the envelope . she drew calligraphic swirls with thick serifs and ornate curves . she wrote , ` ` for potman anus '' on the front , in an architectural script meant to hide her own name and original intent of receipt . she ran her first two fingers softly along the sealed flap , as if to seal it with her own s.w.a.c . carefully shaking her hand through the gap of her slightly-ajar screen door , so as not to alert the windowless surveillance van across the street , she returned the newly-fashioned envelope back to where she herself had discovered it , and shut herself back inside . the ground began to tremble . she looked at the clock , surprised to note that the city started an earthquake on schedule for once . she trusted that anus knew more about these things than she ever could , or cared to . she trusted that should something bad happen , he would have the verbal remedy , or flora tincture on hand , to immediately set it , or something , right . she stood at the front window , and peeked out the peach-colored venetian slats , making herself gray in the darkening afternoon room . she cracked a goat ' s egg over the liquid remainder of her ice cream . she put the letter from her mind , and listened for the rumble of him . today ' s proverb : remember that all sentences must have a noun , a verb , and the phrase ` ` foolish mortals .

'' he explained to no one , a dot in a vast landscape of sand and wind . ` ` oh , man ! '' he continued , looking at the thing he found . he has declined , so far , to describe what he has found , or offer any details or , for that matter , do anything but stare at whatever this thing he found was , and continued to say things like , ` ` wo w ! '' and ` ` they ' re never going to believe this ! '' we reached out to sarah sultan , president of the community college , for additional information , but she would not provide any , saying only that harrison is on a private dig , funded by a small group of anonymous sponsors . she said , ` ` although i have never met them in person , i have spoken to the sponsors by telephone , and they have our best interests at heart . '' ` ` i am sure of it , '' she added . ` ` plus , they totally funded this dig thing , so , what am i going to do , just start asking questions ? '' a lone helicopter on a precautionary sweep of that expanse of the empty desert reported that harrison is still kneeling over whatever it is he has found ; explaining to himself , in an unrecognizable language , the incredible nature of whatever that thing is . more on this , eventually . i guess . whatever . the greater night vale medical community , in conjunction with the mayor ' s office , announced the new city-wide campaign for meatless mondays . each week , in recognition of the immense impact of meat on the environment and public health , meatless mondays will be the days we all set aside to try not to be made of meat . we will all sit quietly , and attempt to will ourselves into a state of organic bliss , seeking to turn our feeble bodies into metal , or silicon , or stone . when we fail to do this , as is likely ( according to the most recently issued laws of physics ) , we will all engage in a group denouncing circle to try to understand whose betrayal is causing the continued failure of this important day . and now , a look at traffic . we are eternal ! we will not last ! obviously , you know that when you die , the matter that is your matter will just become matter , no article attached . that matter will belong to any number of things . that matter is not you . that matter was never you . we are eternal ! we will not last ! but there is more to you than matter . when you die , you will not disappear until everyone who remembers you , and whose actions are affected – however slightly – by your memory , until all of those people die , and you are completely forgotten . we are eternal ! we will not last ! but even then , you are not gone . not until all the people who remember and are affected by those people who remembered , and were affected by you , are gone . we will not last ! but even then , you are not gone . not until all the people who remember and are affected by those people who remembered , and were affected by those people who ... and so on , and so on , and on . we are eternal ! you will persist , ever so faintly , ever so slightly , on into perpetuate . long after everything about you no longer matters . your life is so small . but , in the setting sun of this universe , its shadow is cast down through generation after generation , until it gets flurry and hard to see ... but still there . a breath of a wisp of a thread stretching out before you . we are eternal ! but we will not last ! there ' s a fender bend er on route 800 , near exit 84 b . expect delays . this has been traffic . update : we still are not sure exactly when or how you will need that list today . you remember the list , right ? you were given a list some time ago . you should have memories it . if you did not ... ... i mean , if you diiiidnnnn not ... ... wellllllllllll , i mean ... if you diiiiidnnnn'ttttt ... no one can make your destiny for you . only you can make your destiny . only you and the privileges you were born with , and a whole lot of aimless , meaningless , luck , can make your destiny . the sheriff ' s secret police are going around town , checking in with everyone and seeing if they have the list memories . if you do not , they helpful are shaking their heads and tsk-ing , and then saying , ` ` wo w , you ' re in trouble ! '' before leaving you to fe nd for yourself against whatever dangers this list would have protected you from . more on this soon , as you desperately try to remember the list that was told to you . or even when it was told to you , and in what context . it ' s a very important list . and now , a word from our sponsors . an empty food bowl . an untouched water bowl . a silence in the house . a cage containing nothing . a feeling of uneasy that was once soothed by a joyous instinctual companionship . we listen out our window , and hear not a passing angle . not a ` ` no , '' or a ` ` wait for me ! '' nothing mews . nothing does . absolutely nothing mews . the night is so quiet that our thoughts are a clatter , keeping us awake . in the distance , a dog does not bark . pet co . where did the pets go ? old woman josie told me over a round of bowl ing down at the desert flower that construction on the new old opera house is continuing along well . they have already completed the initial arches , the outer flood banks , and the primary stables . ` ` y up , '' she said , holding her ball in preparation for her turn . ` ` this town will have opera once again . '' ` ` but what is opera , '' everyone else in the league asked her . ` ` is a kind of plant ? does it have rough , leathery skin ? '' but she would not say anything more , and just let go of the ball , which was then carried by a creature named erika ( who definitely was not an angel ) down the lane while erika said ` ` roll , roll ! this is a ball rolling ! '' and then erika kicked over all the pins , while saying , ` ` crash ! ba m ! the ball just hit all these pins and knocked them all over ! wo w ! what a shot ! '' of course , none of us could ... legally acknowledge the existence of erika , so ... we had to let the strike stand un contested . and now , an update on you . just now , there was a man in a ta n jacket , holding a bearskin suitcase , looking over your shoulder . you ' re sure of it . only you do not quite remember it happening . it ' s flurry , and distant , like a dream you had when you were little , and now as an adult , you ca not remember if it was a dream or something that actually happened to you . but there was a man . there was a man , right ? you grasp to recall , but flail only at fragments and gap . he was looking over your shoulder with interest , a bearskin suitcase in his right hand . the suitcase was making a buzzing sound . perhaps the man was too ? you do not remember . ` ` none of this is real , '' you think . ` ` none of it happened . this is fiction . you are hearing a fiction al story , and this did not happen to you . '' still , you ca not shake the feeling that it did happen to you ; that just moments ago , you turned , and over your shoulder was the man in a ta n jacket , holding a bearskin suitcase . he might still be there now . you ' re afraid to check . or , maybe , you already checked , and now ca not remember doing it . you turn to look . nothing there . you turn back . ` ` nothing there , '' you think with relief . only , now , there is a question mark on it . ` ` nothing there ? was there nothing there ? '' the man in the ta n jacket spoke to you , quite urgently , about ... something , but what ? he had a map . he was pointing at a place on the map . now , you do not even know what area of the world the map depicted , let alone where he was pointing . ` ` this is all a made-up story , '' you tell yourself . you decide to feel entertained by the made-up story i just told to you . and yet ... and yet ... ... you ca not shake the feeling , a feeling located just over your shoulder , that this made-up story might not be made-up at all . oh . ohhh , my . listeners , the sun is gone ! it is not covered by a cloud ; it has left , and we know that the sun is generally pretty brave and only leaves when something very frightening indeed is in the area . what could have frightened the sun away ? now is the time , i'm– i ' m sure . now is the time you need to know the list . try to remember . did you write it down , perhaps ? scramble around in the junk drawer in the kitchen , among take-out men us that are years out of date , and flies for health clubs that you never joined . try to find where you wrote down that list . but it is too late ! there is a growl that comes from everywhere . some sort of shape descends from the unless clouds , and a voice , like through a loudspeaker , tells us that now is the time to recite the list , or else ! this is it . if you do not know , then you do not know . i know , at least that . i know . oh ! did carlos know ? thank the mysterious lights in the sky he was not here ! who knows if his brain , so packed with science , would have let a few stray bits of language slip from his memory ! listeners – those left to listen – i take you now , reciting the list , reciting for your very lives , to the weather . hazel nut mystify cuttlefish lark lurk ro– beat beat beat beat beat oh . i am still here . i am looking at my fingers . i am examining my limbs , i am placing one hand on my chest ( like in the chant ed blood oaths we were forced to swear to the flag each morning as children ) , and i feel the circulation of air and fluid throughout my body , the simple machine of liquid dynamic and electrical impulses that sustain through some ridiculous coincidence of physical law , the sentence through which i am speaking to you . everything seems to be in order ... in that i am nervous , and uncertain , and feel an emptiness sometimes which can never be filled , which maybe should not be filled , and a sadness sometimes which wells up regardless of context or reason . so , everything perfectly in order . i ' m fine . we are , as a community , stepping out into the street . we are gathering in open places . i , too , am going . i , too , am stepping out into the street and gathering in open places . here we all are , in mission grove park , and me , among you , speaking into this microphone which , as always , i am uncertain is even connected to anything , but ... i do not care . either way . because i know i am connected to all of you , now . i have felt disconnected lately . my being has been split between the here and the now , and the there and the now . my relationship with carlos currently exists within the idea of distance , within the concept of space , rather than in any specific place . there have been moments where i have doubted my fellow citizens , or have felt perhaps even threatened by them . but that is not the case now , in this moment , here , in this park . diane creighton is with her son josh , who this morning is a meadowlark . i feel only love for them . jackie fiero , from the pawn shop , is showing frances donelson of the antique mall a cool knife that someone pawn ed by running in , shouting ` ` hide this ! '' and running out . there is nothing not to trust and adore about this moment between fellow humans . a cluster of hooded figures lurk along the corner of the park , pointing at various people , seeming to le er and laugh at the oblivious citizens . i am terrified of the hooded figures . but also , comforted by their menace . i think they are even pointing now at me , whispering , and i ' ve never felt more at home . janice , my young niece janice , is here , joined with the rest of us in the park , along with her family whom i do not like to talk about much , but whom i tolerate in all the requisite familiar ways . janice is with her friends edmund , and megan , and patrick , and she ' s waving to me , and i am waving back . i am so glad she remembered the list . i ' m glad we all did . there does not seem to be a single person missing . i counted , and every single resident of night vale is in the park , and doing fine . we heave our shoulders to express release , we sigh to show others we are relieved . we all breathe once , in unison , accidentally . ` ` wilson ? '' says one of us to another . ` ` how are things going , wilson ? '' ` ` oh , you know , '' says the other , although he does not know . ` ` how are things with you , amber ? '' ` ` oh , good , '' she says . and she is right . things are good . and they both take the hand of the person they love , and amber smiles at wilson , and wilson smiles at amber , and everyone smiles at everyone and at everything , and no one is ok , exactly , but we ' re outside and we ' re smiling . and that is a kind of perfection of its own . oh . uh , a sheriff ' s secret police representative arrives in the usual way , by rappelling from the sky and crashing into the middle of our happy huddled , in a ... in a cloud of tear gas and flashing lights . as several people choke and disperse , the representative shouts to us that today was only a drill , that no one was in danger , that this was not actually the day we needed to know the list , although that day may someday come , is already coming , is imminent in the most general meaning of the word imminent , and that we are safe but that we are also in grave danger . we are both at once , and are thus free to fully enjoy our lives . a representative shouts into a bullion from somewhere behind a line of armor ed van s . so , there you are , listeners . all of you who have escaped the tear gas to listen to these words , we were safe all along , and we will stay safe until that time – sooner or later but definitely always on its way – when we are not safe once again . stay tuned next for a surprised man shuffling papers frantically and saying , ` ` uh , uh , uh '' into a mi c he did not expect to be on . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : beware of greeks bearing gifts . also beware of gifts of greek bears . gifted and bare greeks are totally ok .
WTNV|Monolith|15 December 2014|if it looks like a duck , and it quacks like a duck ... you should not be so quick to jump to conclusions . welcome to night vale . listeners , someone built a monolith in front of city hall overnight . last night , there was no 15-foot tall , two-foot thick entangle made of blue slate towering over the faded grass and weakened tu lip garden in front of city hall . but now , there is . a monolith , with indifferent geometry and a long , sharp shadow cast by the low morning sun . it is an ominous construction , channing ancient powers and long-dead gods . perhaps , it is even connected to our primordial extra-terrestrial ancestry . and now , just a few days before christmas , this looming , dark stone shows up mysteriously in the night , casting scornful shadows across both our dreams and our primitive understanding of the world . it ' s super-festive and i love it ! whoever put that thing up , good job ! it must weigh ... 20 tons ? do not know how you did it , but way to get us all into the holiday spirit ! i talked to carlos the other night , listeners . he ' s still t rapped in the ... not t rapped . i told him i d stop saying he ' s t rapped in the desert otherworld . he is ... doing work there . he said after a few months of feeling helpless he ' s made some friends , like the giant soldiers doug and alicia , and even gotten a lot of research done . he does not feel t rapped at all . i told him that he was locked in that alternate desert against his will , and has been unable to return so , that seems to me like a pretty strong definition of ` ` t rapped . '' he said he used to feel that way . but now he no longer feels threatened by the rumbling beneath the sand , or the strange armies that move about the beige wastescape . none of them fighting , only ... wandering . he feels like this desert – the most scientific ally interesting place in the otherworld – is where he needs to be . for now . he quoted that old ad age , ` ` when god closes a door , god opens a window , then god cracks a few knuckles , then god kicks a pine cone up the sidewalk . god also chews a whole bunch of gum . god recently quit smoking , and is really fidgeted . '' carlos used that classic saying to point out that this desert is a great opportunity for his career as a scientist . and i respect that . i asked if he found an old oak door with only one side that could possibly bring him back to night vale . he said he had not , but then he asked , ` ` cecil , if i find that doorway , would you ... maybe ... come here again ? just for a visit . i want you to meet alicia . alicia has a bichon frise the size of a prius , and is really into astronomy . they also showed me some planets and comes they really like . also , the constellations change every night here ! there are new shapes of mythic heroes in the sky every night . i d love you to come visit , '' carlos told me . ` ` we ' ll see . it does sound nicer than i remember , '' i said . ` ` neat , '' he said . i d love to be near carlos again . we ' ve had a great time talking nearly every night , but it ' s ... hard to know how much meeting eyes or touching hands means until it ' s gone . plus , i could use a vacation . other than that brief escape through the same desert otherworld this spring , i do not think i ' ve been out of night vale since ... wo w , um , luftnarp ? svitz . ugh . time flies , comma , is weird . oh , big news ! this wednesday afternoon is the opening ceremony of the devitalised old town draw bridge . because of massive stacks two years ago , and a complete lack of a body of water that would even necessitate a draw bridge , the opening was delayed by 14 years – including a budget increase of over 20 million dollars . so , technically , we ' re still 12 years away from completion , but the city council though we might as well have the opening ceremony now . ` ` we ' ve already burned through the 20 million dollars , '' the city council announced in unison via conference call from a cruise ship . the council were all wearing match ing sun glasses and floppy hats , and drinking a paste liquid through long curly straw out of one large pineapple . the opening ceremony will be held in a collective shared daydreams wednesday afternoon . so , make sure you ' re doing something that is challenging ( both physically and mentally ) on wednesday so you can drift off into this fun community dream event . we ' re starting to get complaints about the new monolith that appeared overnight in front of city hall . the monolith has begun to hover . i mean , not by much , do not freak out over a covering monolith . it ' s , like , two or three inches . not a full foot , or more . the complaints , though , are not about the covering . they ' re about the placement of the monolith . our town ( and country for that matter ) was based on the separation of ancient long-dead religions and state . juanita jefferson , head of the community organization night vale or nothing , announced her group ' s protest against a prominent symbol of old gods and possibly our primordial extra-terrestrial origins being displayed on government property . the city council retorted by slurring their cocktail loudly from the still-active sky pe connection on a nearby ac er lawton that no one knew how to turn off . jefferson added , ` ` treeeeeeeees ! they are us ! '' then bit into a small metal pipe wrapped in a hot dog bu n . while she chewed , we could still hear her speaking clearly , ` ` treeeeeeeeeeeeeeees ! '' she said , her closed mouth moving in slow , undulating cast iron crutches . several others have come to jefferson ' s side in this issue , claiming that while they still fervently worship old gods ( many showing off bloodstained shoes and sharp rocks wrapped in strips of flesh ) , they do not believe it is the government ' s place to express these beliefs so publicly . ` ` , '' came the city council ' s reply from the computer . more on this controversy as it grows out of hand . but first , a word from our sponsor . today ' s show is brought to you by silent self reflection . are you aware of what ' s inside of you ? no , not soft meats and deadly microorganisms . more than that . what makes you you ? how are you able to acknowledge that you are even a thing , separate from the rest of the universe ? do you find yourself casting about in the white noise of the living world , your ear drums flogged with the filth of existence ? we here at night vale community radio recommend silent self reflection . give it a try . here ' s some silence . during this silence , reflect on yourself . reflect on your life , your being . close your eyes , and just reflect . let in no sights , no sounds – and reflect . ready ? here goes . did you reflect ? that was a long silence , right ? do you know how long that silence was ? ha-ha ! it was two weeks ! you ' ve been unconscious for two full weeks ! you ' ve been pronounced legally dead ! your family misses you , but you ' re finally free to be the living ghost you ' ve always dreamed of being . ha-ha-ha ! congratulations ! enjoy a life free of legal consequence . and now , an update on the monolith . some protesters have shown up at city hall carrying signs against the monolith . the signs read , ` ` no monoliths on city property , '' and then a slash through that phrase . which is confusing , because that seems like a double negative , but when you look closely , there ' s also a line through the no part , so it ' s a triple negative , which reduces down to a single negative . there are other signs that are just painted solid colors , so it looks like the monolith has lost the support of the abstract expressions community as well . fortunately , the sheriff ' s secret police have already gently settled the protesters into a fenced-in section of a distant parking lot , where no one can see or hear their protests – thus keeping public order and still allowing for freedom of speech . a win-win . counter-protesters have also arrived in support of the monolith , demonstrating their dis taste for people against the monolith . they ' re holding signs that have a picture of a monolith or ... maybe it ' s the letter i , or l , or the number 1. it ' s ... hard to say , what with sans-serif fonts being all the rage these days . police have placed the counter-protesters into a pen , next to the original protesters , and covered both pens with an opaque and sound-proof velvet dr ape . oh ! we ' re getting word that the monolith is vibrating , and loudly humming . also , it ' s glowing . but i do not know . i ca not feel or see that so ... not really my problem now , is it ? let ' s have a look at sports . the night vale high school scorpions had a rough 2014 season . it was capped off by a scandal involving junior running back maliq herr era . the scorpions had to forfeit all wins in which herr era played because he violated district rules by never truly existing . one of the team ' s best defenders , senior safety jessica lexington , was sidelined most of the season with spinal parasites she got in late september after refusing to yield on a highway off-ramp . additional , sophomore quarter back henry lexington , jessica ' s younger brother , struggled in his first season as a start er . by year end , he showed some improvement as coach nazr al-mujaheed worked with lexington on holding the ball with his own hands , and throwing the ball with his own arms – not other people ' s as he had been doing early in the season . but , on the bright side , it looks like former scorpions quarter back michael sandero has gone on to great success after granulation . many of you know , michael was recruited by a university called michigan . mi – misha m– mitch-again . michigan . michigan . michigan . i ' m not a big sports fan myself , so i have no idea what state the university of michigan is located in , but apparently they have just completed an un defeated season with michael as quarter back , and will compete in the college football playoffs against another school called ... ollabomma . again , sounds like a private school . i ' ve never heard that name before . michigan is favored to win the title this year , and michael is a front-runner for the heisman trophy , given to college football ' s best player . his control over weather elements and powerful pyrokinesis skill proved invaluable to a previously struggling michigan offense . good luck , michael ! your hometown is cheering for you ! an update on the glowing and shaking monolith : the earth below it has split open , and the secret police have issued a statement saying they regret silencing the original protesters . they have since let the protesters out , asking them to protest a little harder . ` ` also , protest closer to the monolith , okay ? '' the secret police shouted at the confused protesters , whose eyes were still adjusting to the bright daylight after being in a dark pen all afternoon . ` ` try getting right up on the thing , and protesting ! '' the officers called from behind their cruisers . the secret police also asked counter protesters to try talking to the monolith . ` ` you like it so much , why do not you marry it ? '' the secret police teased , before adding , ` ` no , no , seriously , go talk to that thing , ok ? it is freak ing us out ! '' but all protesters have scattered from the scene . the monolith is now shaking violently . i can – i can hear it , here in the station . i can feel it throughout my body . my skin is rattling ! i can see the great green glow . it is so bright ! the cement walls of our station seem almost to be fading ! so , as our physical being becomes either rent into atomic mist , or subsumed by a sphere of comic energy , let me – in my final act as a tangible being – bring you today ' s weather . well , the monolith split open . there was a deafening crack of shattered stone , a flash of blinding light , the stench and taste of suffer , as we felt rocky dust settling upon our cowardly crouching backs . in the hay aftermath we looked for the dead , and found none . we looked for the wounded , and found none . we looked for damaged streets and buildings , and found ... well , we found presents . we found city streets strewn with gold-wrapped toys and parcels of fine chocolate . there were ornate bags filled with silk scarves and swirling gilded ribbons and glitter notes wishing every person in night vale season ' s greetings , along with gift cards to popular stores like target , and the ralph ' s , and hatred . aah , um , hm m . look . i hate to ran t . but given that night vale long ago abolished materials , this seems like a cruel holiday prank . i– i ' m glad no one was hurt , but this whole monolith thing was really annoying ! it was not a deadly threat to our city or our lives , merely a time-wasting tribute to the worst qualities of the old gods . it took most of the afternoon to clean this up , but thankful , it ' s all been swept away and dumped into the landfill . the city council , upon hearing of the storm of holiday presents upon our town , swiftly and noble returned from their tax-funded island vacation , and offered their condolence for us having to witness this consumers assault . they reminded us that santa is a cia-created myth , and that the holidays should not be about buying things , or getting things , or even giving things . ` ` christmas , '' they chant ed in unison , ` ` is about being a little less distrustful of neighbors . of casting our eyes down more respectfully when we pass hooded figures , or people wearing some kind of official-looking fire arm . christmas is about being at home with family . doors locked , everyone speaking clearly , and within range of the hidden camera . '' at that moment , a low-flying police helicopter passed over city hall , its searchlight frantically flashing across the terrified faces of every single citizen . it was truly a magical christmas moment , and the whole crowd winced with holiday cheer . one lone person asked , ` ` but is not christmas a religious holiday ? should the city really be promoting a religious holiday ? '' the city council quickly replied , ` ` not any religion that we ' re aware of ! '' and the secret police kindly ushered that grumpy scrooge off to a less public place . night vale , sometimes we see something strange and different , and our first reaction is to loathe and fear it , to bring rage and scorn against its very being , but that ' s not the christmas spirit . this is the time of year we must learn to not shout down things we do not know or understand , but simply hide from them , and later pretend they were never there at all . and today , we mostly did that . we mostly did good , night vale ! huh . maybe it will be a merry christmas for everyone . maybe , this is an auspicious start to the holidays . hey ! that ' s the best part about the future . anything you want to be possible is possible – as long as you do not think about it too hard . stay tuned next for the sound of something cawing its way out of your chest . good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : it ' s not the size of the dog in the fight . it ' s the size of the other dog in the fight .
WTNV|Antiques|1 January 2015|it ' s not dark est before the dawn . it ' s actually dark est after all the stars have gone out . it ' s very dark then . welcome to night vale . we begin this new year with some troubling news . frances donelson , owner of the antique mall , has reported that some of her antique have escaped . she said that when she fed them this morning , they were all accounted for . but when she went back for the usual mid-afternoon watering , the fence had been cut and over half of the antique were missing . ` ` they did not escape , '' she corrected reporter , who were just trying to talk to her a bit about what had happened , were just doing their best to help her out , and so did not need to have their heads bitten off for using a different word , but ... whatever . ` ` they did not escape , '' she said . ` ` they were set free . '' all surveillance camera in the immediate vicinity – and this is not a particularly interesting or dangerous part of night vale , so there were only three hundred and forty-four – had been disabled , or moved to point away from the antique pen , or had their tapes replaced with vs cassette full of mattock episodes , recorded and re-recorded over each other so that each tape shows ghosts of every mattock at once – a single , unified , mattock , through the flicked and warp of video age . the secret police warn citizens that antique are wild animals , and while generally friendly , their behavior can be predictable . if you see an antique , do not approach it . simply put your hands over your chest , scream ` ` we ' re all about to be eaten ! '' and run blandly away . ` ` although it ' s possible this may cause the antique to instinctually go into hunting behavior and chase you . we did not bother to check . look , we were kind of busy . was there something stopping you from doing this research ? '' the sheriff ' s secret police concluded , before shaking their heads and melting back into the walls . strexcorp synernists inch , the company you might remember as our former unfriendly overlords – or you might not remember them if your memory has been altered or erased . anyway , strexcorp is , of course , owned by beings that are ... difficult to describe without using the illegal term ` ` angels , '' but who are all named erika . as part of their continual process to turn the power of strexcorp toward the betterment of our world , the elias have started the process of releasing those people whose lives strexcorp took possession of , back during what could be termed it ' s ` ` bad boy days '' or ` ` dystopian capitalist hell days '' – whichever you prefer . among those released is janice rio ( from down the street ) , last seen entering a con do , which you should definitely never do . never go into a con do . also released : lucy and hannah gutierrez , former owners of the former white sand ice cream shop that ' s bankruptcy led to their lives being confiscated by strex . they are looking well and fit , no worse for the wear than any ordinary person who is , say , imprisoned by the city council in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town for voting incorrectly on municipal elections . ha-ha , we all experience extra-legal extended imprisonment at some point in our lives , after all . they pledge to re start their ice cream shop , and are currently running a kickstarter to gather together the funds . in order to get better results , the kickstarter is labelled as being for a blend er you can plug an phone into to get real-time blending stats and earn blending points on the blending community . it is not actually for that , though , it ' s for an ice cream shop ! and i do not know about you , but i ca not wait to have another bite of that magical gutierrez ice cream . chad bowing , who lives in the shambling orphan housing development down by the haunted baseball diamond , said ` ` it is a sadness , what we do to each other . it is a weeping , and a gnashing of teeth . '' i do not think this was in relation to strexcorp , or kickstarter , but he walked by and said that to me , so i thought i d throw it in . thanks , chad ! and now another edition of the children ' s fun fact science corner . stick out your tongue . farther ... farther ... is that really as far as you can get it ? i bet you can get it a little farther than that ! wo w ! that ' s , like , three feet ! honestly , i– i expected an inch or so . uh ! oh ! uh ... now it ' s at five feet ! how – how long is your tongue ? how long is a tongue supposed to be ? um , uh , can we get someone to check on that ? th – this is starting to freak me out a little , your endless tongue . this was supposed to be a fun and challenging exercise , but now i ' m questioning everything about myself and my life . i'm– i ' m shivering ! your your tongue is reaching out the door , it ' s down the street , it – it ' s rolling out of town ! look how far your tongue stretches ! you have not done well , young child . but you ' ve certainly done something . you certainly have . and somewhere , the tip of your tongue is still rolling on , ta sting a world that neither it nor you can see . say , are you related to uh ... huh ... never mind . that does not matter . oh , god ! oh god , that ... that tongue ! that hideous infinite tongue ! this has been the children ' s ... fun fact ... science ... corner . there are many reports coming in about the missing antique . people have seen antique tracks , have heard creatures root ing around in their garage , grazing on their laws , loping through their back yards . it has been difficult to tell which direction the antique are moving , because many of these reports contradict each other and most are likely people mixing up the antique with other similar-looking animals , like owl s , or yeas , or bacteria . inter maureen , who has , all told , been inter longer than anyone i can remember – well done , maureen ! – anyway , maureen is back at school right now , so her friend hector is taking over for a bit . hi , hector ! great to have you on . inter hector is waving , he ' s saying hello , he does not have a mi c , so his ` ` hello '' does not exist for you . nothing exists for you outside of my voice saying it does . anyway , hector , can you do me a favor and go check out what ' s going on with the escaped antique ? reports are muddled , and we need someone on the ground , so to speak . in the ground , as they say . buried deep in the earth , as the saying goes , to understand what ' s really going on here . hector is nodding – now that nod exists for you . goodby , hector . until we see you again , very soon and very well , i ' m sure . now , this . imagine a man . this is a simple command , leading to millions of conceivable scenario . imagine this man . every possible physical form , location , and condition that a man can be in . perhaps this man has been dead so long he is dust . perhaps you are imagining dust , and perhaps you are not wrong . imagine a man . imagine him . there is a buzzing light bulb above him . he is standing on what could loosely be called the porch of what could loosely be called a tin shock . the light bulb buzzed and buzzed . he looks up in irritation . you were wrong to imagine him as dust . do you have him now ? do you know what he looks like ? imagine a man . no . no , i ' m sorry , no . you were incorrect . and so the weekly ` ` find the man i ' m thinking of '' contest will roll over to the next week . this is the three hundredth consecutive week without a winner , and the prize for next week will be the three hundred and one custom made pencils that say ` ` i won a thing . '' ugh . i hope someone wins soon . the giant box of pencils here ? starting to get in the way of things . ohhh ! guess who ' s in the studio with me ! well , not actually with me , but projecting himself into our physical plane . that ' s right , my favorite scientist and yours , but mostly mine , carlos ! carlos : hi , cecil ! cecil : carlos , i know we just talked last night , but for the listeners , why do not you tell us what ' s new out in the desert otherworld you ' re trap oo p ! uh , the desert otherworld you ' re spending some time in . carlos : well , i– i ' ve been doing so much interesting research ! i ' ve learned the composition of the rocks ( which are not of our world ) , and the composition of the components of the rocks , which are of our world , strangely , and i ' m trying to figure out how many stars there are . i mean , they ' re always changing size and position , but ... i do think there are a lot of stars . cecil : that sounds very scientific . carlos : oh , it is so scientific . the most scientific . i do not think i ' ve ever been more scientific , and you know how much i love science . cecil : oh-ho-ho , yes . i am also very into science . but i miss , you know , touching ! i miss this ! listeners , you ca not see , but i ' m trying to hold his hand , and my hand is just going through him because he ' s not actually here . carlos : i– i know . that ' s why i ' m working on a way for you to visit . i think you d like it here ! it ' s super interesting , and there is so much science . plus , the people are way friendliest here . people in night vale can be a little ... cecil : no , i– i know . i suppose it could not hurt to take a little visit . but i need to be back in my radio desk soon . it can be difficult to ask station management for time off of work . carlos : great ! so , i ' ll let you know when i figure out exactly how to get you here . ugh , i can not wait to see you in person again . cecil : me neither ! carlos : can not wait . can not . cecil : oh , ok ! me neither ! carlos : it ' s go n na be good . cecil : uhhhh ... them . well . thank you so much for this highly relevant report that had important information for everyone in town . thanks , carlos . carlos : bye , cecil . cecil : bad news , listeners . it seems that the antique have gathered around city hall and are behaving in threatening ways toward anyone trying to leave or enter . we are getting reports that while city council has already safely evacuated ( using a rocket s led that they keep for this very purpose ) , mayor dana cardinal is still t rapped inside . the sheriff ' s secret police are responding quickly by issuing press re leases to explain why it ' s definitely not their job to deal with this situation because , frankly , it seems pretty dangerous and scar y . they said that they have activate all available officers to work hard on deflecting responsibility away from them . as the sheriff ' s secret police slogan goes , ` ` not our job , not our problem . '' oh , no ! oh no ! um , i ' m being told that the antique have found a way into city hall . the pack is entering the building . city hall has been infiltrated by hungry antique with no one left to protect our mayor ! who will protect dana ? someone ! someone must ! will no one step forward ? will no one ? is anyone even listening to this ? what what kind of town are we ? what kind of town are we ? also , here ' s the weather . well , listeners . well , well , listeners . it seems ... it seems that all is well ! we do not know how , but our beloved mayor is safe once again . a person of unknown identity appeared on the scene , running into the city hall and single-handedly defending the mayor ' s office against the pack of antique . this was ... foolish of that person . that person could have been killed , or gravely wounded ! maybe they were ! we do not know who the person is , or where they went , and so their fate is as nonexistent as anything else i do not or can not voice . mayor cardinal gave a message of thanks , saying ` ` whoever you are , thank you . i do not speak for the town or for the city government . i speak for myself , as a person , as a human full of blood and worry . thank you for keeping me safe , '' she said . pamela mitchell , director of emergency press conferences , held an emergency press conference in which she added to the mayor ' s statement by saying , ` ` clouds are the belt of the sky . cinch them tighter ! make the clouds go tighter ! make the sky come closer ! '' before hurling herself into the sky , until she was just a dot in the upward distance . so , that seems to be another crisis averted , albeit in a sudden and – if i may be frank , as a journalist – narrative ly unsatisfactory way . perhaps we will never know who that unknown savior is , or who the unknown liberator of the antique was . perhaps we will never know anything . we have certainly never known anything yet . oh , but wait ! oh , inter hector is returning . um , hey , hector ? did you see who the unknown benefactor was ? uh , do you have any information ? oh , no ! hector is ... hector ! he is holding up his arm . there is a tear in the skin , a deep and jagged oval . he has been bitten . oh , hector ! it was you , was not it ? i sent you to report and instead you involved yourself , and ... and i thank you for doing so . ordinarily that would be a violation of journalistic standards , which clearly say we should never help when we could merely watch , but ... dana ! dana is a friend of mine , and so i thank you for ignoring our sacred rules just this once . i ' ll be honest , i– i– i would not have thought hector was the type to do something like that , or even physically strong enough to fight off an entire pack of antique , but ... people can surprise you . that is one of the things that people can do . but ... hector ! that bite ! you know what happens to someone who is bit by an antique . hector is unable to speak . has been unable to speak since he arrived . listeners , of course , anyone bitten by an antique becomes an antique themselves . oh , inter hector , if only there was something i could do for you ! oh ! oh ! he – he is transforming , and his body is elongation , and lowering . his shoulders turn to haunches , his arms to wings . ugh . his feet to bladed molty legs . he is becoming an antique before my eyes , and i can do nothing for him ! for this brave young person who saved my dear friend dana ! hector ! he is out of sight now . i can hear only a click , and a shudder ing movement . must ' ve fully transformed into an antique . hector ? hector ! is there any trace of your old self left ? or are you already hunting me ? ugh . how good are the bolts on the studio door ? he – he – he – he – he ca not come in here , can he ? i hear a rattling in the ceiling , and there is a clear viscous substance dripping onto my desk . i dare not look for its source . um , ah em . coming up next , hopefully , the sound of my successful escape from this room ! ah ! what just touched me ? hector ? hector ! well , uh , this is it . uh , one way or another , uh , here i go , listeners . and here you go , ha-ha , off into radio silence , into places and times where my voice can no longer guide you . good night , night vale . good night ! i made it ! i totally made it ! i ' m fine ! i ' m fine ! uh , to the family and friends of inter hec– today ' s proverb : if you want a picture of the future , imagine a person writing headline about millennials forever .
WTNV|Water Failure|15 January 2015|see some evil , hear some evil , speak some evil . welcome to night vale . sorry to start the show off with such a minor issues , but the water here at the station is not working . i was trying to make coffee – i got out the filters , grabbed some whole beans from the larger , finely ground them using a hammer and hateful thoughts , and placed them , one ground at a time , into the coffee machine – but when i went to fill the caraffe , there was no water . i turned the fauces handle and just heard a faint hiss . 45 minutes worth of coffee preparation for nothing ! this also means the toilets are not working . fortunately , there ' s a huge ravine right next door to the station , so ... that ' s that taken care of . honestly , i – i probably should not lead off my show with a personal complaint about how there ' s no water , instead of an important news story like how there are suddenly two sun s instead of one , but i ca not help it ! i just get all worked up about a lack of coffee ! it ' s fine . i ' ll be fine . but ... yeah , there are definitely two sun s now , and people are screaming in the streets . it ' s pretty apocalyptic out there , with buildings being burned down and cars wrecking into fire hydrate and people running in all directions , mouths gape , clutching their heads . so stay inside , and avoid thinking too hard about the capriciousness of our only home : the indifferent universe . let ' s have a look now at sports . former night vale high school quarter back michael sandero had a fantastic fresh man season at the university of michigan . he won the heisman trophy , and his team made it to the national championship game . unfortunately , they lost in overtime to ... michigan . it was the first time in college football history that a team had to play against itself in the title game . down by three points in overtime , sandero threw a late intercept ion , thus sealing his team ' s loss . sitting dejected on the bench , their heads hung low , and shoulders sagging under the weight of regret , sandero and his teammates could only watch as the other sandero and his teammates celebrated their victory over themselves . the winning michigan team celebrated on the field until late into the night – everyone else having long since gone home , and the lights turned out – until a flock of startings covered their cheering , dancing bodies , and carried them all into the sky . speaking through a russian translator , the losing sandero said , ` ` i do not know where i am . where is michigan ? i am so confused right now ! who are you ? who are you ? ! ? '' he was staring auspiciously at his own hands and crying . better luck next year , michael ! you can do it ! many listeners have been wondering if i ' ll be taking time off work to go visit carlos in his desert otherworld . well , the answer is ... maybe ? i certainly would like to . i miss him so much , but ... first , carlos has to find the doorway between our worlds . also , even trickier , i have to get vacation days approved by our station management – which is not easy . i filled out the special form to request days off , which includes writing a 2,500-word description of what i will be doing with my time away from work . it had to be exactly two thousand five hundred words . and i ' m not sure if hyphenated words count as one or two . anyway , i submitted my form last wednesday by going to station management ' s office door , genuflecting , and reciting the pledge of employee felty , which is several minutes long . i was actually blocking the only path to the kitchen , so by the time i finished there was a long line of co workers waiting on me . all of them , at some point , have gone through this same emotional devastating process , when they wanted to visit a new nephew or go on a honeymoon or something . so , they were understanding . but ... i chose to do this around noon , so they were also mostly hungry and frustrated . once i finished the pledge , i dropped the form into the drop box , which then glowed red and puffed out dark smoke . when i got back to my desk area , all of my belongings were gone , and there was just an open pit , a hole that seemed to go on into eternity . and knowing management , it likely does . so the request was definitely received , and we ' ll see what they come back with . oh ! oh , dear ! station management sounds upset ! i– i– i– i do i do not know if if it ' s because i ' m talking about them on the air , or if they ' re just now finding out that the toilets are not working ! um , either way , uh ... lets let ' s move on ! uh , speaking of the water , all of the tap s in our building are blowing a cool , dry air that smells of ... toast ed walnuts , maybe . or , no ! no oo ! like french toast ! either way , it ' s pleasant . we ' ve tried to turn off the fauces , but the hand les just spin loosely and have seemingly no effect on the smell . we tried calling the plumber but they just screamed something about there being four sun s . ` ` four sun s ! '' they bowled into the phone , before muttering for a while about nothing being as it seems , we ' ve been duped by god , all is lost , blah-blah , something-something living nightmare . so , i guess we ' re going to have to contact the water department directly about this issue . oh ! also , i should have mentioned earlier , the two sun s have now doubled to four sun s . there are now four sun s in the sky . so that ' s awful . but listen ! better than no sun , right ? man , days with no sun are just the worst ! you know what ' s not the worst ? the sponsor of today ' s show . our program is brought to you today by chevrolet , and their new line of all-electric vehicles . these vehicles are made entirely of electricity . you already own one . there ' s a chevrolet inside your home ' s wiring this very moment ! your microwave , your television ... you will have to harness that power and learn to turn pure electricity into matter , and then that matter into an operational vehicle , and then figure out how to operate that vehicle . but it ' s all there ! right now ! in your home ! in fact , since you already have the car , do not you think you should have paid for it ? do not you think you owe chevrolet for the car you have ? that ' s how the world works ! there are no free cars , pal ! no pe ! please send $ 45,000 to chevrolet right now . or , return the vehicle . you either pay the money , or return the car . one or the other . that ' s only fair , right ? chevrolet . we ' re trying to be reasonable here ! local television station channel 6 has come under fire recently for their decision to start broadcast ing into viewer ' homes , whether viewer want to watch channel 6 or not . many residents have written to their government representatives , saying it must violate some law for a television news station to broadcast straight into people ' s homes without the residents even turning on their television . ` ` it must be a violation of privacy laws , right ? '' these letters often read . ` ` surely the government must step in to stop this , '' the letters usually conclude . ` ` we hear your concerns , but the government can not stop this , '' the reply always says . ` ` the local television news station is controlled , and managed , by the government , and it is wonderful to be able to reach everyone in town at every point of the day with important news , '' the letter always continues . ` ` like , let ' s say there ' s a tornado . a rare event here in the desert to be sure , but let ' s just say , '' the letter always supposes . ` ` how would you know how to protect yourself from such a danger if there were no government-controlled television station that could turn on in your home and shout terse , esoteric orders in a foreign language , let ' s say russian ( it does not have to be russian ) as slow-motion foot age of salamanders running out of a rotting log plays . how would you know ? '' the letter challenges . ` ` you would not , '' the letter declares . ` ` maybe it ' s not an emergency , '' the letter concedes . ` ` maybe we just have something really exciting to tell you ! maybe we got a new stand mix er and we want you to see it . or , maybe we ' re feeling sad and we just want to read you some poems we wrote . so , as you can see , the trustworthy local television news station must retain its powers , '' the letter always concluded . ` ` these powers help us care for you , citizen .

'' ` ` what did not work ? '' they rhetorically asked . ` ` not important , '' theyreplied to themselves . ` ` awe said , that was certainly no ta code word for an undercover agent , who apparently was not listening the radio when they were supposed to be , which is ( by the way ) their only job , another duty , and their life ' s mission to be listening to instructionsfrom headquarters , so ... no biggie . but maybe , just do something as simple as listen to the radio at the time we tell you to . '' ` ` anyway , none of that is important , '' the agency continued , ` ` and there is no particular reason we ' re asking you , but ... could you say ` ` brinydepths '' again ? it ' s for a friend ' s birthday . it ' s also our friend'sbirthday , we forgot to mention that . please say it again . '' so ... ok.here goes . brinydepths happybirthday to your friend ! i hope you enjoyed that , but ... i really not keep interrupting my broadcast with this stuff . littleleague coach betty lucero is reporting that there are strangegoings-on near the haunted baseball diamond her team uses for practices and league games . ` ` no , no no , no , i know , it ' s haunted , '' she said . ` ` i get that.you do not have to explain that to me . i ' m saying that there is otherweird stuff going on beside the usual ghosts . '' she went on to describe languished howls coming from a neighborhoodnearby , and a red glow at night that made her skin feel loose and itchy when she looked directly at it . she also said that the baseballdiamond has started to smell of rotten eggs , which is a detriment to her team ' s performance . awe spoke , an apparition of a gray-skinned young woman in a tattereddress appeared covering on the vaseline between second and third . imayhave yelped a little ... maybe scrambled backwards a bit , but coachlucero laughed and said , ` ` oh , that ' s just lucia , our third basecoach . she died in 1843. say hi , lucia ! '' the young woman flicked out of view , then reappeared suddenly inchesfrom my face , her pupil-less eyes staring directly into mine . responded in a professional and calm manner , and coach lucero laughed for unrelated reasons , not anything to do with how i may havereacted , and said , ` ` that ' s our lucia ! '' she then went on to say that she had a bad feeling about the weirdgoings-on near the baseball field , and she probably said some otherthings , but i was running away , so i did not hear her super well . oh , listeners ! this is exciting . i received mail today ! i did not thinkmail was still being delivered – not after what happened at the post office – but here it is ! an envelope addressed to one cecilpalmer in neat handwriting , with the address of the station rightunderneath . if courant to send us any mail , since apparently that is a thing whichexists and is working now , our address is nightmare , pleased send stuff in . it ' s always nice to hear from fan s . but , back to this envelope . maybe this is silly , but i waited to open until i was on the air . it seemed more fun if we could find out together what was inside . i ' m , um , i ' m opening it now ... adhere we go . it ' s ... oh . huh . its greeting card ! it says , ` ` thanks so much '' on the front , and it has a picture of a cat playing with a ball of yarn , well that ' s justice cut est ! although , i ca not imagine why someone sent me this card.i ' m ... i ' m opening it ... oh ! oh ... oh . a photo fell out . oh ... dan g it ! it fell behind the desk.um , the inside of the card just has the words ` ` thank you for whatnot did '' printed , and then it ' s signed ` ` erika , '' over and over in multiple handwriting . huh . let me ... let me try to grab thatphoto . ummmmm , i ' m going to have to crawl under the desk . while i do that , here ' s word from our sponsors . today's'broadcast is sponsored by robe beef.kobebeef ! the beef that makes you fresh ! alright , listeners , i got the photo . and it ' s ... it ' s a photo of ... me , at city hall ... i ' m fighting off a pack of antique in front of the mayor ' s door , but ... that was not me ! inter hector did that , lastmonth . he came back with that bite ? i do not remember ever leaving my desk when the antique attacked our mayor . what ... what is this photo ? it must be fake . it does not lookfake . not must be fake . right ? why would i not remember saving the mayor ? more on this later , as i face my fragile self and try to understand my own reality . ok , now . this is getting out of hand . the vague , yet menacing , governmentagency sent me a snapchat and several anonymous asks on tumblr , saying that they were happy about me doing that whole ` ` broadcastingtheir secret codeword '' thing before , but that the message didn'tseem to be getting through . or , it ' s not a message , that was poor phrasing on their part , sorry , they ' re just flusteredtalking to their favorite radio host . www ! theymeant to say that they have not had the best birthday ever yet . and neither has their friend . plus , they forgot to mention , millions and millions of people have the same birthday as them , think of how manypeople have their birthday today and all of them , the agency is sure , ` ` just want youth say that littlething again . just once more , in your smooth est , deepest voice . '' they say that they ' ve made it so our station is currently broadcast ing on every single radio frequency , so no one could possibly miss thesespecial birthday greetings , and it will finally the ` ` best birthday ever .

'' larryleroy , out on the edge of town , lit his refrigerator on fire , but he said that was not because of any secret agent stuff , he just wanted too that . someone had suggested it to him once , although he could not remember who . in fact , it seems that every single person in night vale was actually secret agent waiting to be activate . we had all been implanted with the exact same code phrase , which is the kind of floppy organizationthat is just what our government is coming to . or ... whatever . and such . you know , look . honestly , my heart is not in this reporting . bah , bah , everyone we ' ve ever known is secretly an agent . but ... here i am , listeners , secretly a hero . secret even from myself ! it was nothector who saved dana , but me . me , acting without memory or agency.what ... what is happening to me ? how do i not remember something so huge ? i ... ineed to talk to carlos . perhaps science can help me . science so rarely applies to the real world , but once in a while it provides an ice metaphor or turn of phrase that makes you think about realthings differently . i ' m ... i ' m hoping carlos can do that for me . now that everyone has been activate as a secret agent , and did the one thing they were secretly supposed to do for years , everyone has justgone right back to doing what they had been doing before . everything back to normal , except that we all know we are all secretlyundercover planted agents here to spy on each other and since we allow it , we are no longer secret agents . we are just ourselves , secretly . listen , i know it ' s confusing . but i did not invent logic . ourextraterrestrial ancestors did . staytuned next for all the air being sucked out of the room you ' re in , we ' re sorry , we ' re so sorry , but this is the only way . good night , night vale . good night . today'sproverb : i let my waters be my motivators . mostly they tell me suck , and then i get sad . this was a terrible idea .
WTNV|Hatchets|15 February 2015|dare to dream . do it . we dare you . go ahead , dream . it'llbe fine . we promise . welcome to night vale . leannhart , publishing editor of the night vale daily journal , announcedtoday that , for a limited time , the daily journal will print actualnewspapers again . no longer will subscribers have only the imagination edition of the daily paper , a compulsory and automatic $ 60 monthly charge to imagine whatever news you want . they will , onceagain , have the tyranny of a printed daily edition – where all of the stories are immovable declarations of recent history , told by abiased and underpaid third party . ` ` it'san exciting time to work in print journalism ! '' hart shouted after news longer who was sprinting away from the hatchet-wielding veteran of the printed word . earthen hurled another hatchet at the terrified representative of thecally journal ' s digital competition . she hit her target just behind the knee , felling him as he made a sharp cry and a dull shalt thud . ` ` veryexciting , '' hart shouted . she added , ` ` these printed versions of the daily paper are collector ' s items . we ' ve deliberately inserted bunch of errors into them because , true collectors know , that makesthem worth a bunch more . '' listeners , i for one think a recurrence in the newspaper industry would be great . this could mean even more jobs here in night vale . ` ` thiswill create lots of new jobs for night vale , '' hart will certainly have said by this time tomorrow . ` ` lots of real awesomejobs , '' i am sure she will have reiterated . and now , a look at traffic . theresa accident at the corner of hollows road and great hills drive . its pretty bad accident . it is likely neither party saw an accident of this magnitude coming . each driver stands , staring , dumbfounded their two twisted cars , which look like one . one ... what ? not a car . spiteful burning beast borne of mundane haste and arrogant industrialprogress . thermo drivers can not comprehend what to do . they are still , mostly.fidgeting , sometimes . thinking , not at all . neighbor who came out of her house upon hearing the hard smash of hard metal ca not seem to process what is happening , either . she'sslowly leaning away as if wanting to leave , wanting to forget she ever witnessed this , but she can not move . she can not take that firststep . her eyes , growing wide , wild , as her mouth opens , slack at first , and then slowly recoils into an unheard scream . thermo drivers feel the neighbor there , but they do not turn . they do not ask for help , or aid . too scared to move , they stand and gazeinto the crumpled slits along the sides of the pressed cars , thatdamnable block of hot machinery and its black smoke swirls . an don the concrete , there is glass . and above the glass are arms , adair , and drying blood . and the drivers stare at their own wretchedbodies inside the mangled contractions , and they do not think aboutanything other than what they once were . they watch their bodies , hoping for a twitch , a breath , any kind of movement . hoping for another chance in life . so , it ' s backed up pretty bad near the best buy . choose some alternateroutes today . thighs been traffic . you know me , listeners . i ' m a pretty straight and narrow radioprofessional . i am all about objectivity and impartiality . but it'stime for a cecil palmer editorial . given the growing prevalence of the internet – not just on computers , but also phone and watches and owl s and certain trees – our privateinformation is just out there , waiting to be taken and exploited by the wrong kinds of people . of course , it ' s vitally important thatvague , yet menacing government agencies have access to our personaldata – like income , dream journals , phone logs , embarrassingthoughts , and slash fiction archives . ooh , also , the police and the world government . oh , and the mayor , and the careless old woman who secretly lives in all of our homes . yes , those people should all have access to our private data . but now , there are things called ` ` script '' and ` ` algorithms '' thatch just scan our e mails and our purchase history and all thosephotos of cats wearing baseball mitts we like to share with eachother , and these script and algorithms are sometimes called ` ` both . '' thesebots are large cyborgs that break into our homes and look through our stuff , and then feed these secrets to corporations and then , these corporations make more both , and soon , we will have to fightbot armies . but with what ? knives and guns are completelyinternet-based now . they will turn against us in that war . we are not safe from the impending bot wars . so , stop having personal data is what i ' m trying to say . no more e mails , no more job histories , night vale , no more cat pictures , or eroticfan fig , or text messages . know , i know this difficult . on the one hand , we enjoy having personal information likecareers and friends and hobbies . on the other hand , we ' re talkingabout warrant on the third eleven-fingered hand , nothing is to say that botswould not be benevolent leaders , but i do not wish to find this out . i'msure the naysayers will tell me that i ' m overreacting – which i am , but ... it ' s my opinion , ok ? you do not get to tell me whose overreacting . you ' re underreacting , i'llsay ! yeah , i ' ll totally say that . i ' ll say it right to their face , that what ? what ' s that ? ohio , ok . uh , listeners ? inter maureen just handed me a note explaining that the city council has just declared all information totally public . and that since no information is private anymore , the giant corporations and their both can not harm us by mining private data . the city willkeep all our information safely out in the open , and available anyone wearing sun glasses and a side arm . hey , thanks maureen ! moments ago , the sheriff ' s secret police held a secret press conferencereminding us that all murder is illegal . also , attempted murder . ` ` like , let ' s say you try to kill a person , but you do not actuallysucceed , '' a secret police spokesperson whispered from behind concrete pillar in the underground garage of the disuse east nightmare mall . ` ` then , that ' s stillillegal , even if you did not kill that person . '' ` ` but , what if you just thinkabout killing a person but do not actually do it ? '' came one questionfrom the batch of reporter , who were also whispering and hiding . ` ` well , that ' s not illegal , then '' the spokesperson whispered in reply . ` ` but , i have it all planned out and everything ! '' the reporter continued . ` ` i just have not done it yet . is that illegal ? '' ` ` well , that ' s just mean , and kind of weird , '' said the secret policespokesperson before walking out into the open and saying , ` ` leann , is that you ? '' ` ` u mm , no ! no . no o . noooo ! ` ` came a comical ly deep voice that was obviously fake . ` ` not me at all ! i ' m just an old babel wrapped someone left on the ground ! i ' m in animate garage ! '' ` ` leann , we know it ' s you , '' said the spokesperson . ` ` stop attackingbloggers with hatchet ! we found a dozen more wounded baggers in mission grove park this morning ! they all had hatchet in theirbacks , and were very upset . it ' s not nice , leann ! it ' s also illegal , ok ? '' ` ` i ' m a bagelwrapper , you ... jerk ! '' hartreplied , still whispering and hiding . and now , a word from our sponsor . you are thirsty . of course you are . we are all metaphorically thirsty for better things , but you are literallythirsty . literally thirsty for anything . you could feel your dry lips , swollen and sticking together , their crusted gray edgesadorning the pink pain beneath . you lick your lips , felling better for a moment , but actually worsening the problem . it'shot , right ? pretty hot and dry , actually . are those flies ? yes . those are flies . are those birds ... cultures ? yes . actual cultures in your home . ` ` how did these soaring scavengers get in my home ? '' you think . perhaps you could use some cool , pure , natural and refreshing fili water.yes , fili water sounds so oo nice , does not it ? butfiji water is not who is sponsor ing this show . fili water doesn'teven know about thisshow . who is sponsor ing this show ? we can not tell you . we ' re not allowed . fijiwater is completely unaware of you , too . sorry , this will not end quickly . so very , very sorry . thighs been a word from our sponsor . thisafternoon , night vale high school and the armed militia that make pour committee for civic pride are holding a tick er tape parade for local sports hero michael sandero , who became the first night raleigh athlete to play in a college football national title game . unfortunately , sandero ' s team , the university of michigan wolverines , lost to copies of themselves in the title game . but sandero did win the heisman trophy for the nation ' s best college football player , and did his hometown proud . internmaureen , who i sent to report on the parade ... oh ... is testing me thatthere ' s a problem . um , i ' m getting word that leann hart has interrupted the festivities with an announcement . oh , wo w . according to maureen ' s flurry of texts , hart is claiming thatmichigan did not playitself for the title . as proof of her claim , hart passed out copies a news article from the michigan daily from january 13 , statingthat at the end of the season , michigan lostmore games than they won , and that their quarter back ' s name is devingardner ? not michael sandero . on the front page of that issue of the daily is a headline stronglyindicating that people at the university of michigan can remembermost things correctly . prettymuch no major memory problems here , the headline reads . she also claims that a school called ohio state won the national title over a school called oregon . maureenconfirmed that while ohio is , in fact , a u.s. state , michigan and oregon are neither states nor cities anyone seems to have heard before . we ' re still trying to figure out their languages of origin . maureenis testing me that hart is now shouting ` ` longer ! '' over and over.maureen is testing me that hart is hurling hatchet now , maureen istexting me that everyone looks pretty scared , maureen just tested me , '' i ' m hit . '' um , let – let me ... let me respond really quick . is ... that ... slang ... something ... maureen ? ok , she tested back , ` ` i ' m hit , she got me , i ' m bleeding . '' um , uh ... i ... id o not understand young people and their weird text-speak at all . whoever knows what she ' s trying to say ? well , whatever . while text maureen back with a quick grammar lesson , let me take you to the weather . listeners , i have just learned that maureen was struck with a hatchet thrown byleann hart . so , then : to the family of inter maureen , she was a good inter . a valiantintern . brave , right up until the end . sadly , she is with us no more.she will be missed . forth hatchet attack on maureen , as well as several other attacks today ' s parade , and more than five dozen similar hatchet-basedassaults in the past several weeks , the sheriff ' s secret policearrested leann hart . ` ` we told you it was illegal to kill people , leann ! '' the sheriff himselfsaid from his hover-office in the clouds . ` ` and also , to try to killpeople . '' ` ` but they were news baggers ! ` ` hart replied . ` ` i ca not stay in business and create jobs if newsbloggers are putting me out of business and destroying those jobs ! '' and the sheriff agreed , saying it ' s the secret police ' s job to protectbusiness interests , as well as citizen interests . the city councilalso agreed . so did the vague , yet menacing government agency , nodding quietly from inside their long , black sedan with tintedwindows , while snapping photo of everything they saw . the mayor did not agree.mayor dana cardinal went against the city council and said that she , for one , did not think people or business es should be allowed to use physical violence against their competition or anyone , for that matter . the city council bristled , and then they all squawked and few away . it is unclear whether or not news baggers agree , as many of them havegone silent on this issue , replacing their investigation reports anything pieces with pictures of cats wearing baseball gloves andtop-rated recipe for invisible pie . the sheriff then announced that all charges against hart would dropped , except forth assault on inter maureen . ` ` maureen , after all , was not news longer , but a radio inter who posed no direct threat to hart'snewspaper , '' the sheriff said . an di agreed . the sheriff then played the entirety of domenico gall ' s sonataquinta on his gold cells . ` ` but ... but she looked like ablogger , '' hart insisted . ` ` she was tying into her phone . all those baggers do that ! baggers lovetyping on their phone . '' ` ` but she worked in radio , leann , '' the sheriff said , as he ended a series lifting high notes with a single discordant bass tone . he closed his eyes and shook his head . ` ` i ' m sorry , but that is attemptedmurder . you have to go to jail now . '' ` ` oh ! but i did not attempt to killer ! you said murder and attempted murder were illegal . murder wasn'tmy intent !

WTNV|There Is No Part 1: Part 2|1 March 2015|there is no part 1. this is part 2. welcome to night vale . listeners , i wo not waste your timerecapping everything that happened in the earlier part of thisbroadcast . there were so many events of such tremendous impact insignificance , that they ' re surely locked forever in your memory . so , let us – a town with an imperilled mayor , and a brutally injuredsheriff , a town under attack , a town in the middle of something that we are seeing through from start to finish – let us continue rightwhere we left off . harrison kip , adjunct professor ofarchaeology at the community college , announced once again that he is super sorry aboutaccidentally raising the sand golem by whispering sweet nothing to that salesman he found out in the desert . the team of six wealthy sponsors who backed this project , and who he has only ever spoken to by phone , told him that this was what mysterioustalismans liked . ` ` talismans love to be flirted with in a sexywhisper , '' the anonymous sponsors had told him . although they nevermentioned that doing so would cause a sand golem to rise and turnagainst the humans around it . ` ` my bad , '' harrison said , gravely , continuing , ` ` mo s ' def , my bad , '' before fleeing into the desert , receding from human form , to distanthuman form , to dot , to smudge , to misplaced pixel on the horizonline , to memory , to vague recollection , to an idea just out of reach , to something i knew long ago but now can not grasp enough to feel its absence . thousand golem – along with thousands of angora rabbits , which werereleased from the night vale petting z oo by unknown malicious parties have reached the upper floors of city hall and are attackinganything that moves . or does not move . or just exists , anywhere on the spectrum of motion , with its huge sand fists and their soft , harmless fur . director of emergency press conferences , pamela mitchell , held a non-emergencypress conference , explaining that the situation seemed too urgent distract everyone with the usual emergency press conference . she reada statement written by mayor dana cardinal , indicating that the mayors given up on her previously announced plan to barricade the door , and then found her subsequently announced plan to hide was ruinedwhen she released the statement announcing it . and so now , she announcing her current plan , which is to fight . to fight and to win . listeners , i would gladly help the mayor but , as i ' ve been regularly expressingthroughout the morning ' s tragedies and this afternoon ' s attack , have conflict ed feelings here . yes , mayor dana is a dear friend , an done of the citizens of this town i trust the most , but ... but ... the last time i helped her , it was done without my will . not against will , without . i was used as a puppet to save a good friend , and good friend though she is , it is not a feeling i wish to experienceagain . i'lltell you what i think it is . i believe the culprit is whoever bought lot 37 from the sheriff ' s secret police auction last year . lot 37 : one radio host . one cecil palmer . one me.i believe whoever owns that lot has manipulated me into the role of hero . like an action figure , limp in the sticky hands of a child . id o not wish to be manipulated again , except in that way that anyone who lives in an all-seeing authoritarian state is constantlymanipulated for their own health and well-being . such is the wish fall people : to be manipulated in ways that are good for them . but , all to say , maybe someone else can help dana this time . morand more on this soon , as there has been much and much before . constructionwork is already commencing at the bowl ing alley after the shockingincident we reported on earlier today . i know i'llnever look at one of those ball return machines the same way again . teddywilliams said the space should again be available for bowl ing wednesday at the latest , that league night is set to continue asscheduled , and that he ' s had enough . just enough . there ' s only so much one person , you know , that one person can take , and that limits reached several months ago , and he ' s just been coast ing . you know , coast ing , trying , doing his best , and now this ? now , this.right ? now , this . he does not know what next , what now , he does not know what he ' s going too . probably not thisanymore , he does not think . how old do you have to be to retire ? how old is he ? he does not know the answer to those questions , but he'llfind out , and then he ' ll ... know , you know ? he ' ll know . and again , league night is continuing as schedule . which ... wh oo ! would not be a good week for me without league night ! and now , another word from our sponsors . you already know who we are . we introduced ourselves earlier . let ' s not waste time retreating the benefits of our product , how little it costs , how easy it is to get , how unwise it would be not to buy it , and where exactly we took your loved ones . instead , let ' s concentrate on the legally-required disclaimers . we , uh , forgot to do those , and our lawyer got really mad about it . have you ever seen a mad lawyer ? their ears standstraight up , and they wo not stop barking at you . it ' s ... terrifying . so , we need to add that using our product could result in sterility , senility , hearing loss , vision loss , finger decomposition , major toe swelling ... like a lot of toe swelling – that might not sound like a big deal , but waituntil you see how big your toes get – scratchiness of the throat , throat loss , heart palpitating and minor night screaming . also , when we said hearing loss , we meant you d be able to hear loss . as plants age , as pets die , as marriages break apart , or evolve , settle from a fluttering of hands to a loose entertaining of fingers , as children leave home to go wherever it is that children go after the age of 10 , all of these common forms of loss you will be able to hear , it will be deafening . oh , we could go on all day about the ways our product will severely ruinous , physically and emotional , but what are you going to do ? not buy it ? i think that you and your ( for the moment , safe ) loved onesknow that you will buy our product no matter what we say . so , let'snot waste any more time . our lawyer has stopped barking . bu your product . thighs been another word from our sponsors . oh , i ' m sorry , listeners . there is a knocking on my studio window . it isa man in a ta n jacket , holding a bearskin suitcase . it is difficult to describe his features , as they escape my mind the moment my eyesleave his face . he is waving , indicating that he would like to codein and speak to me . and , presumably , to all of you . u mm , yeah ! come on in ! but how would we even get there ? i ' ve never heard of that place . i ... id o not remember ... what i was just saying . um , i think someone was justspeaking to me , and to all of you out there , about something thatseemed very important.but now ... now i ca not remember ! you all heard him too . do you remember what he said ? norway am i sweat ? i think i remember him offering me a note . or somepiece of paper , i did not take it , uh , maybe i should have taken it ? id o not know . speaking notes , i am being handed another one by inter hannah . hopefully is better than the note she handed me this morning during the earlier section of this broadcast . that was such an awful note ! mean , i do not have to tell you , right ? so sad , sad and awful . you remember . also , kind of funny , though . just a pretty sad , awful , funny note , really . um , but this note ... well , it seems that ... no . no , no , no , no ! it seems that once again , during this recent bit of missing time , ` ` braveradio host cecil palmer has stepped in and helped mayor cardinalfight off the sand golem and the angora rabbits . cecil , showingstrength beyond his stature , held the sand golem down while danawiped away the writing on its forehead that gave it unnatural life , dispersing it to in animate sand . '' another we just , kind of , showed the rabbits . they were just rabbits and , even in great numbers , were not at all threatening . ` ` thisleft the mayor safe , with only a few bumps and bruises and a wreckedoffice covered in sand that probably will never be completely cleanedaway – certainly better than what happened to the sheriff '' that poor man . i'mbeing told that mayor cardinal indicated deep gratitude for my help ' m being told this because i do not remember this ! because , i am certain , now , the owner of lot 37 , the owner of cecil palmer , once again used me only to protect dana . that is i ' ll have to think about whatthat is . but first , a continuation of our previous children ' s fun fact sciencecorner . children , it ' s now time to go check on those glass vilas we prepared earlier in the broadcast . if you mixed everything right , and placed it in awarm , dry place like we told you to , you should be able to now observe the start of the tendrils . do not get close to them ; thosetendrils have a strong grip . one could call their grip unbreakable , or even poisonous . you might also hear buzzing . do you hear buzzing ? listen closely . sciences all about observation . write down what the buzzing sounds like detail . draw a graph to show the buzzing . what the buzzing is telling you is that the thing in the vi al has marked you as its prey . you need to run.oh , you should have started running the moment you heard the buzzing ' m sorry , ha-ha , i should have said that before the rest of thisstuff . you don'thear anything , then congratulations ! you can move on to the secondary of the experiment . lay down plastic sheet ing in the room , and we ' ll be back to give you the full instructions later . thighs been part 2 of the children ' s fun fact science corner . this day started bad , and it does not appear to be getting better any timesoon . i , however unwillingly and unconsciously , helped the mayorfight off her attacker . and yet , even that act was not enough to end this ordeal . hirammcdaniels , literal five-headed dragon , and the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home , both former mayor al candidates , havetaken city hall once again captive . hiram preventing anyone from entering the front door using his massivebody , fire breathing , and harsh language . mayorcardinal has issued a statement through her mouth , shouting out of an upper floor window that the careless old woman is stalk ing her through city hall . dana can hear bare feet glittering across thehallway ceiling , can sense the memory of motion in the air when returns , can feel breath on her neck – dry and cold , like breathnever is . ` ` she has come for me ! '' dana shouted morally . ` ` i will not be able to avoid her forever ! i will not be able to do anythingforever ! '' hiram , in response to questions asked by a group of lightly-scorched secretpolice currently trying to ta ze and arrest him , admitted that he and the careless old woman have been conspiring against the mayor for quite some time . convincing pamela mitchell to enter a disastrousretirement , stag ing a blatantly consumers christmas displayinvolving gift cards and an ancient monolith , freeing the antiquesfrom their pen , funding the dig that led harrison kip to find thousand golem ' s salesman , un sealing and freeing the army of tiny peopleunder lane 5 of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex this morning , working to sabotage the ultimately successfuldefense led by the sheriff today against the tiny army , from which the sheriff miraculous emerged unsheathed . then , causing the sawcyclone that swept through the sheriff ' s office – not injuring hi mat all , but reallymessing up his draperies . and then , finally , sending the sheriff an angryletter , which resulted in the serious paper cut he is currently recoveringfrom . and now , all of these measures unsuccessful in removing dana from power , hiram and the careless old woman have been left with no choice but attack the mayor directly . ` ` just try to stop us ! '' said hiram . ` ` just try . '' ` ` godlike to see you try , puny mortals ! '' roared another one of his heads , although ... not the one you d think . well , certainly , i wo not try . i ' ve had enough of this mayor-savingbusiness . my job is to report , that is what i do , reporting ! that is why they call me what they call me : a journalist ! now , let me report , and onlyreport . we are taking all to the weatherrrrrrrrrr ... ... ... . here am , listeners . whoever i am . here it is , the me that is whichever me i am . you can guess what happened , i think . once again , it was brave cecil who saved the mayor , throwing his body between her and the wrath of thefaceless old woman and hiram . it was not an easy fight , and not uneasy fight for me to remember . herein what i know : hiram mcdaniels is no longer at city hall . with my help , the secret police almost apprehended him , but our efforts , while just enough to prevent his continued siege , were just underwhat was needed to capture a literal five-headed dragon . and in the scuffle , hiram disappeared . he could be anywhere . svitz , lemuria , the secret lost pet city on the moon , or even still in night vale . eventual . herein what else i know : the careless old woman who secretly lives in all of our homes was unable to complete her malicious plans against our mayor , and is now secretly living in all of our homes still . she did not need to change anything in order to hide . thereto rebels , who are against the mayor frightfully chosen for us forces we do not understand , will not rest quietly . i have no doubt of it . i know that there is more coming , as always . this is what know . herein what i do not know : the owner of lot 37. who bought me at thatauction and did nothing with their prize for so long , only to now use me again , and again , with one purpose , to protect one person : danacardinal . mayor cardinal . my friend . herein who i do not know , but thought i did : dana cardinal . my friedland i am starting to fear , and i am starting to doubt the owner of lot 37. could she be ? who else would be so invested in protecting herald only her ? dana ? is it you ? could it be ... it could not . it could not ! could not . but still ... but still . huh . staytuned next for part 3 and part 4 and many more parts , each succeedingmoment after the one before , and some you will hear and some you will not . and none of them will be true , exactly , but all of them will bean honest attempt at the most accurate fiction possible . good night , to our recuperative sheriff . good night , to a mayor i once thought knew . good night , to old woman josie and the rest of the bowl ing team ' ll see you at league night . andgoodnight , night vale . good night . today'sproverb : history is written by the victors . and then forgotten by the victors . and then the victors die , too .
WTNV|The Drawbridge|1 September 2012|cecil : if wishes were horses , those wishes would all run away , shrieking and buck ing , terrified of a great unseen evil . welcome to night vale . construction crews are on hand at the night vale public library today to begin the renovation that wereapproved last year by the city council . some of the improvementsplanned for the library are a new children ' s wing , something called a '' knife pit , '' an upgrade computer room with several empty desksand a loudspeaker that repeats ` ` technology ruins lives ! '' and , most importantly , thicker plexiglass to protect citizens form thelibrarians who were previously allowed to roam freely throughout rebuilding . city council said renovation have beendelayed for several months because it has been difficult to findconstruction crews willing to work in such dangerous proximity tolibrarians . but they finally found a very talented and brave crew conduct this project : colston contractors , inch the city council is asking that no one mention to any of the colston workers that they are working near librarian . they think that they ' re building elaborate new pinkberry . the city council then added , '' yesssssss , '' and then they released a bunch of badgersinto city hall – much to the delight of onlookers who thought that the badgers were kitten . the onlookers were quickly and painfullycorrected in this matter . more on this story as it develops but first , today ' s horoscopes . aries : aries , you have much in commonwith a tree . a sadness that no one can see , or understand.communication only through silence and wind . skin made of wood . the way you collect sustenance through roots buried in soil . you ar every , very much like a tree.almost impossible to tell the difference . taurus : taurus , today is the day that you change everything . oh , i ' m sorry . imisspoke , i ' m sorry . uh , let me try that again , ok ? *ahem*today is the day that everything changes you . you will be completelyunrecognizable . yeah , that ' s it . there a go . remind : how scared are you of centipedes , remind ? i mean , no reason . theaters are just asking . like , are you super superscared , because i ca not say for sure , but you ' re pretty brave , right ? like , you could handle a couple of centipedes ! you could handle bunch of centipedes ! right , remind ? no reason . i ' m just asking . cancer : today is an excellent day for you to demand a promotion , to approach the one that you ' ve been secretly thinking about for years , to try your hand at that new hobby that you are considering . unfortunately , it is a terrible day for getting that promotion , having that person say yes , and not injuring yourself badly on a power sand er . but you should at leastfeel great about the attempt . leo : there ' s just thick , green smudge here , and the word ` ` cryptotoxicology . '' so guess that ' s a good thing , right ? virgo : now , wait.there are still some of you left ? how did you survive the greatculling of virgos that swept through – oh ! you know what ? i'msorry , that ' s not ‘ til next week . sorry , i got confused thereof , yeah , today looks very good for you , virgo ! maybe use this lovely day to get all your affairs in order . just a thought . libra : all your dreams will come true today . or ... i mean , one of them will.you know that recurring dream where you ' re chased through a housethat seems like your own , but it is not quite , by a swarm of bees that you ca not see even though you totally know that they ' re there ? well , it ' s not that recurring dream , it ' s the other one . and i am so , sorry . scorpio : your armslook weird . and your face is a natural irritant . and your personalityleaves much to be desired , the principal desire being your immediateabsence . you disgust me , steve carlsbad ... i mean , scorpios ? ugh.scorpios , right ? sagittarius : buy tourniquet . the best that money can buy . capricorn : today'slucky number is imaginary ! but , co incidentally , so are you , and yourentire experience of the world . aquarium : you wannamake some money fast ? i do not know , rob somebody . commit fraud.there ' s lots of ways . pieces : you ' ve justo another brand new car ! you stare bleak ly at your home filled withstacks upon stacks of new cars , occupying every possible space impossible angles . today ' s brand new car is wheeled in and as you feel its bulk pressing up against you , taking the last bit of yourhome that had still been yours to live in , you feel tears hot uponyour cheeks . congratulations on your prize ! listeners , i havejust received word that there has been an accident at the library.the intricate papier-mâché and balsam wood scaffolding has collapsed . the sheriff ' s secret police have reported no seriousinjuries from the accident , but they are saying that one of the densetitanium and heavily-electrified cases containing a librarian was damaged , and that that cage is now empty . night vale , this terrible news . there is a librarian on the loose in our city . midnight vale , there is no triple-thick armor ed wall or bloody animalcarcass lying over a bamboo covered pit of sharp sticks to protect from this stalk ing oblivion . without the military grade steel walls the library to keep the librarian contained , night vale , we are helpless ! we are doomed . watch your back , night vale . oh ! i almostforgot . we have a new inter , and that ' s always fun ! so , let ' s have him introduce himself on the air . inter andrew : hello , i ' m inter andrew we . super excited about being here . was along waiting list when i signed up , had to wait , i do not know , threedays until the other interns had ... left the station , but my name sup on top now ! cecil : yeah ! well , we are just thrilled to have you here . andrew : i look forward to a long and healthy life in radio . cecil : say , um , andrew , what do you know about librarian ? andrew : librarian ... oh no . when i was young , my mother used to work in thecal mines before they were converted into the holding pens that they are for those who vote incorrectly in the municipal elections . she went out to work each day , miner ' s helmet under her arm , pig slungover one shoulder , fencing sword tucked into her belt , and bloodiedaxe across her back – the usual miner ' s get-up – and she woulddescend into the dark with her fellow workers seeking out coal or tetany valuable hearts of rare bat s . cecil : ok , so fantastic ! what i ' m go n na need you to do – andrew : my mother saw terrible things down there in the dark . hay , featheredthings swarming , weeping things . gawping , gasping things with claws and spokes and singers and more claws ! day in and day out , this washed job ! mining coal and fighting the pensions of the dark downwards for their hearts . when she came home she d recovered in coal dust and lymph . my mother was neverafraid , though . nothing phased her . except for the day i had to get abook from the library for a school science project . she insisted on going ahead of me to clear the way , but after a few minutes she cameo ut shaking , pale , her fencing sword all bent , her axe broken inhale . ` ` run ! '' she shouted , ` ` run ! '' librarian are feared even by the fearless . but i did get a b on the project ! cecil : oh , that ' s good ! and – and that was a very well-told story . um , also , i need you just to ... run on down to the library , and just do little bit of research on librarian . andrew : to the library . cecil : yeah ! yeah , good luck . you ' ll be fine . he ' ll be fine ! yeah . well , i ca not wait to hear what inter andrew comes up with ! listeners , we are already getting reports from all over town about the escapedlibrarian . lies el schmidt , who owns the auto body shop near somerset and gray said she heard whispers . and the whispers sounded as if theywere coming from just next to her . ` ` where do you live , lies el ? do godlike cars ? how many cars will you fix before you die ? what is yourfavorite color of paint ? do you know what i look like , lies el ? do courant to ? do you want to ? '' and the whispersechoed off the closed garage doors of the vast , empty workshop . andliesel said with each question , a halo gen work light would fade black , her auto body shop slowly darkening until the whispers were all she could see . and yes , somehow she could see them . until the final question . ` ` lies el ! can i come live with you ? i am all alone , lies el ! '' and the last lightexploded , and the room went black . and before she could even startle usual process of panic , lies el felt – and here she is , alone , in the dark – a small hand slide , slowly , into her own . and lieseltried to pull away , but this childlike hand kept sliding further and further into her palm , and the childlike hand was thick , serpentine , enlarging continually and wrapping around her wrist and then her forearm , and she felt the sharp pierce of what seemed like blades , but were likely just the rigid causal spine common on mostlibrarians . and lies el tried scream , but she could only gasp . and she gasped through a clenchedthroat and bared teeth , ` ` please ! please , let me be ! i– i– have a family ! '' and it was the possession of this family that saved her , as her business partner and sister , pick , having just arrived , fired a blowtorch at the book-loving monster , and it slitheringlyscurried and hurriedly slithered away . listeners , i havealso received word from green market board president tristan cortesthat he can not stop feeling his own heart beating . and he feels throughout his entire body , and it feels like there is an enormousengine buried in the earth beneath him , shaking the very foundations the land , but it is not an enormous engine , it is a heart . and it is actually so fragile , and so small , and there is ... something justo the other side of the front door , he said . and it breathing . and he breathing . and cannot bring himself to look outside . he knows who it is . he knowswhat it is . andros heart is reacting as any heart would in the presence of librarian , the rhythm of his own liquid life pulses through his tongue and his lips , throbbing and impossible to ignore , and he can feel it in his feet as he tries to stand still , and he can feel it in his chest as he tries to yell over the din of his pulse , the boom ! boom ! boom ! lingo his heart , and finally he manages one terrified shout into thecal morning air . and tristan could not say for sure that it was librarian on the other side of the door , but he did say that he couldsmell that familiar librarian odor of burnt coffee during a sinusinfection . and heals said that after the beast left , the day ' s mail had appeared on the front porch . so ... it could have just been a reallyspooky postal worker . and now , a wordforms our sponsors . today ' s show brought to you by american express . i have with me a representativefrom american express in the studio , here to tell you all about thisamazing card ' s many features . the representative is just a slighthaze in the air , and her name is deb ! deb ? deb : thanks , cecil . hello , listeners out there . i think i speak for all american express employees , annals for all sentiment patches of haze , when i say that i am justthrilled about the new american express obsidian card . cecil : ohhh ! well , that sounds very exclusive ! i'm– hata , i ' m actuallystill using the same am ex that i got in college , um ... it ' s just apost-it note , and it has ` ` real american express card '' written on it , and a drawing of a thumbs-up . and i trust this card completelyalthough , admittedly , i have yet to find a merchant that willactually accept it . deb : well , the new obsidian card will solve all of your problems . it'saccepted worldwide by any merchant that keeps their store dimly lit , and fingers sadly all day on memories of lost loved ones . it ' s easy – if you hear crying , then your card is welcome . cecil : oh ! deb : and the benefits are better than ever ! the obsidian card featuresfull purchase protection , extended warranty on electronics , breathless hunger that can never be sa ted by mere canal appetite , and the quiet loss of one part of your body every month . we do not telly which part . it ' s a surprise . it also gives you points for airline . or it points at the nearest airplane if you petit on a flat surface , i do not remember which . cecil : well , that sounds really great ! deb : i do not care what it sounds like . cecil : oh . deb : it ' s already in your wallet now . it ' s in the wallet of all yourlisteners . it has replaced the wallet of all your listeners . many objects in their home will now be replaced by the american express obsidian card . everything theytouch will turn into a black volcanic stone credit card . they willaccidentally kill people . people they care about . and whose onlycrime was being touched by the cursed listener . american expressed not leave home . cecil : wo w ! what a great product and/or service ! you know , i try not to listen to or remember what anybody says to me ? taking in knowledge can be a super dangerous thing to do . speaking of danger , the librarian was just seen near the dog park . the long-talonedcreature with its many round black eyes and hairy brown teeth was seen sealing the dog park fence . city council has warned us manytimes that the dog park is off limits , that dogs are not allowed in the dog park . that people are not allowed in the dog park . that we may see hooded figures in the dog park . well , witnessessaid that as the librarian approached the dog park fence , the hoodedfigures all ran away , in different directions , their cloaksfluttering in a wind of motion , revealing match ing black and whitening tennis shoes . but , before the librarian could enter the dog park , a small band of maskedchildren showed up , holding slingshots and well-worn copies of chinuaachebe ' s critically-acclaimed post-fatalist novel longer at ease . ball accounts , this was the same group of fifth through eighth graderswho bravely escaped last year ' s summer reading program at the nightmare public library . the leader of thatescape , 13 year-old tamika lynn , was with the group of kid s at the dog park trying to back the librarian down from the fence . as a small boy blew a low , long tone on a con ch shell , tamika held aloft the severed head of the librarian she defeated last summer ( stillsurprisingly well preserved ) as a gruesome warning for the librariancurrently terrorising the forbidden municipal park . witnesses said that the librarian shrieked meekly , and leapt form the fence as the children chased after it shouting suggested additions to the library ' s fiction stock . ` ` maxinehong winston ! ` ` came one shout . ` ` larrymcmurtryis a cornerstone of new western literature ! '' came another cry . ` ` have never read elizabethbarrett br owning , i hope you add her ! '' came a final call as slingshotted rockesplunked hard off the retreating librarian ' s exoskeleton . tamika then spoke.we have her actual speech , because we are all being recorded at allies by several different organizations , and of course , amateurcommunity spying clubs . here now is tamika lynn ' s statement : tamika lynn : people of night vale , we are your children . we are your children who survived the librarian . we are your children who defeated strexcorp.we are your children who learned the power of books . the power of books is that they teach you how to destroy what is , but should not be . the power of books is that they show you what it might be like to think as someone other than this person you are stuck being . the power of books is poisonous gases and spring traps . nothing more powerful than a book . a larger book is slightly more powerfulthan a smaller book , because it can also be used to hit your enemies.smaller paperbacks are terrible for that . take it from me , i'vetried . hero of our timemight be a classic of russian literature , but it is useless against the hide of a librarian – even when launched with a homemade booklauncher . this is why vladimir nabokov ' s famoustranslation addedseveral thousand blank pages and a carbon steel bullet-shaped duffjacket . but your physicalstature is unrelated to your strength . you are strong because you germany . you are strong because you are in this together . you are strongbecause of that weird rain that gave many of you double-quick handcombat reflexes and seventh eyes . you are strong because , if enoughpeople believe in their own power , even if armed only with massmarket paperbacks , they can bring down not just a librarian , but entire corpora tic regime ! as for us , yourarmy of missing children , we are not missing . we are found ! herein our plan , night vale . we will give up . we will lay down our arm sand quit fighting . we will close our eyes and sleep . yes , that is what we will do . once we have crushed every enemy in our path ! once we are victorious and bathed in blood , and placing stickers on reading levels far beyond our ages ! reading levels that are yet to rediscovered ! pizza reading rewards in quantities and kinds that areunimaginable to the enlightened ! as india gandhionce said , ` ` you can not shake hands with a mangled fist that hasten chewed up by an un chained librarian . '' you are not alone.you were never alone . we will advance on the librarian together.believe in us , night vale . we will exist either way , but you might swell . you might as well . cecil : unfortunately , witnesses were too shaken to see where the librariandisappeared to . listeners , i urge you to follow tamika ' s example of strength and courage . be brave , like tamika ! but do so indoors , yeah ? keep your homes locked , and listen here for furtherinstructions . but now , let ' s have look at the community calendar . this thursdayafternoon at the rec center is the sheriff ' s secret police'ssemiannual gun buy-back program . if you have an illegal orunregistered gun , bring it to the rec center , and the secret policewill buy it from you with full amnesty , no questions asked . secret police representative said it d be ` ` especiallycool '' if you hadfully-automatic rifles and some hand grenade . ` ` like , reallycool ! '' she repeated , here eyesdarting about , her knuckles rhythmically cracking . ` ` also , '' she added , ` ` please do not tell anybody we ' re doing this . it'stotally covert . '' there is an eventthis thursday night at dark owl records . for more on that , we haveowner michel nguyen on the phone . u mm , michelle ? michelle nguyen : hi , cecil ! cecil : welcome to our show , michelle ! michelle : am i ... on a podcast ? cecil : no . this is my radio show . michelle : oh . good . podcasts are dead . i hate podcasts . cecil : hm . so , michelle , i got a press release saying that you have special event this thursday at dark owl records . michelle : i wish i had not sent that out . i did not want anyone to know about it . cecil : it does not actually say what the event is ; it just says ` ` dark owl records , this thursday night , you probably would not understand and probably wo not be invited . '' michelle : so , this thursday night , the dark owl staff and i are going to try discover fire . it ' s a private event and i ' ve ordered them never to tell anybody what we find out because if everyone knows how to makefire , then everyone will start talking about how to make fire , another people will be making fire all the time . and suddenly makingfire wo not mean anything . we will no longer feel what it means to create flames . we will no longer cry under the glimmer ing orange lamp of nature ' s most cruel and useful force . everyone loves making fire , then how can we truly know what it evenmeans to feel heat , or light a scented candle , or fr y an egg , or takerevenge on your own diary ? cecil : not to be a spoil-sport here , michelle , um , but fire was discovered along time ago . michelle : i know that ! fire ' s been around for decades.blah bah bah , history , bah bah . but it ' s important that my staff and i discover it for ourselves . cecil : hm m . michelle : it ' s like bone said , moments before he died : ` ` it ' s all been a lie , and i wish i had been more aware . '' cecil : oh . well , it sounds like a cool event . michelle : please do not ruin it with adjective . cecil : well , it sounds like an event . um , michelle , i do not know if you'veheard the news today about the escaped librarian . michelle : i found out about the escaped librarian years ago , from thisunderground magazine called füteür . cecil : future ? michelle : füteür , with two umlauts . cecil : oh , ok . well i ' ve never heard of füteür . michelle : of course you have not . the only way to get a copy is to walk to the middle of the whispering forest . the trees there will try to lure you into becoming one of them by complement ing your outfit and physicalappearance . but i ' m immune to positive feedback . so i ' m one of the only people who can walk through there . my friend richard a tree there now . he used to inter here . cecil : yeah ! michelle : he wanted me to tell you hi , and you have a nice voice . cecil : oh , that ' s so nice ! michelle : you have an ok voice . i guess . richard ' s the one who told me about the magazine . in order to read it you have to climb this one tree , this creep seeker named edge , who appreciates my hats way too much . at the top of redgeis a plastic magazine kiosk that ' s covered with band stickers and misspelled cuss words . füteür magazine comes out weekly , and tells you news , all before it happens , insuring that i never have to have my parents or someone over 30 tell me something i did not alreadyknow . so , yes . i knewabout the escaped librarian well before anyone else . cecil : so , what happens ? i mean , did füteür explain how we were able to save our town or if , if we were able to save our town ? michelle : probably . i do not remember . it was not very interesting . there was review of an amanda palmer album that comes out in eight years . ire ad that instead . anyway , i ' m covered spiders , so ... know that . cecil : oh my gosh ! i ' m so sorry ! please , go call an exterminator right now ! michelle : no ! the spiders are my outfit , cecil ! i ' m not going to kill them ! cecil : ok . um , well , thank you very much , michelle . uh , listeners , thisthursday night at dark owl record , michelle and her staff will try discover fire . michelle : please stop knowing this . cecil : so , before you go michelle , do you have any special approaches ortechniques you ' re going to use to discover fire for yourselves ? michelle : we ' re going to use simple elements , like cigarette lighter and gasoline . i got ta go . my hat is crawling down my back . cecil : ok ! thank you very much , michelle ! more on the community calendar : this friday night , all lanes of route 800 will be shut down in both directions as workcrews stand in the middle of the empty , dark highway , repeating '' bloody mary !

steve : oh , glad you asked . saturday ' s benefit will feature a seated dinner , a silent auction , a live auction , a secret underground auction , twofake diversionary auctions , and a ruffle drawing where we hunt , capture , and clean the winner . cecil : well , great . that is all the time we have today ... steve : sorry , cecil ! cecil , sorry ! can i just add that tickets for the benefit are still available online ! ha-ha-ha ! they ' re only fiftydollars , or you can pay at the door . it ' s go n na be held at the rec center . you just go past the auditoriums and you look for the door . it ' s not a door you ' ve seen before , but you will know it when you see it . go through that door , and then continue through a series increasingly smaller doors , as it becomes harder and harder squeeze your shoulders , and then your chest and hips , into the increasingly dark and quiet crawlspace . then just when you think you will become stuck , you will become stuck . and all will go silent , andy ou will hear nothing except something feathered , and you will feelnothing except something feathered . and you will not be heard fromagain . cecil : that sounds like fun ! steve : it will be ! it ' s go n na be great ! super blast ! super blast good time ! ha-ha-ha ! cecil : ok , whatever . you know i was just humming to myself until you stoppedtalking . steve : ok , well , can i just say one more thing ?

monday would like for you to leave it alone . it is not its fault that you are emotional un prepared for your own professional lives ! mmm , mmm , mmm , mmm , mmm . howard you doing right now , dear listeners ? no ? are you ... afraid ? would like to tell you that i am not afraid . um , i would like to be strong in the face of imminent death , night vale . i am , after all , the voice of a community , and i must neutral . impassive . just ... simply reporting the news . i would like to feel something resembling confidence . but , i am feeling something resembling petrified terror ! i am very similar to a scared person . the city council has just announced that ... dearlisteners , i– i– i– i do not know how to tell you this , but ... the city council has just announced that all of the librarian have escaped . nightmare , we do not yet know how many librarian there are , or whatexactly they are capable of . we were already too scared to read or even thinkabout good literature , and now even our own book-free personal spacewill be invaded by these monsters ! like the great american writer mark twain once said , ` ` reading ' is hardly worth all this bloodshed . that is why all my novels are waddedup candy stall receipts that i leave on park benches . they shouldnever be put in libraries , even after i die – in the next few minutes , at the hands of this drunk minotaur stand in ' in my parlorright now . '' now , mark twain was wise enough to know that libraries are a bad idea . listeners , i ' m go n na call my boyfriend carlos just to ... just to see what he thinks . i mean , i know , i know , he ' s only a scientist , but he might have some good ideas about how to handle these unholybeasts . carlos : hello ? cecil : hey , carlos . uh , it ' s me . i'm– i'm– i ' m calling you from the show . carlos : oh , hey ! yeah , i was listening earlier , um , but i got distractedwith , um , uh , with work ... yeah , i ' m ... i ' m standing in front of a roof beakers , with different colored liquid , intermittently rubbing my chin and writing down long , complex , equations . and there is a giantcomputer next to me , too , with several blinking buttons . cecil : well , you ' re obviously ... hard ... at work . hard at work . and i ... and ire ally hate to bother you . no , wait ! how are you able to listen to radio show from an alternate desert otherworld ? carlos : oh , i ... i just reprogrammed my phone using some basic scientificlaws , and now i can actually livestream your radio station ! yeah , so ... so time does not work correctly in night vale , and it worksactually even less correctly here , so sometimes i get old broadcastsfrom before we met , and once i heard a future broadcast but i turnedthat off as soon as i realized what was happening , because you know , some thing just are not meant to be known . anyway , so i heard that you announced that there ' s a new wing of the library opening , that ' s exciting ! cecil : no ! no ! no , that is not exciting ! well , actually , technically , yes itisexciting , but it ' s like , the horribleexciting ! there are escaped librarian on the loose and ... listen , this is one of the few times that i am glad that you are in alternate dimension . at least , there , you are safe from bloodthirstylibrarians . carlos : why would we need to be afraid of librarian ? librarian are helpful and kind ! i mean , i do not want to generalized about all librarian , you know , certainly there are some mean librarian , just as there are some mean people , i mean ... just as there are helpful and kindlibrarians and people . they are no different than any of us ! so , i myself have never actually met a librarian . yeah , i , uh , since am a scientist and not a writer or an editor , i ' ve never actually had to read a book . cecil : oh ! carlos : yeah , and thus , um , yeah . and – and – and have never actually beeninside a library . uh , but , but i had friends in college who wereliterature or journalism major , and they told me that librarian did things like ... help recommend good books , and find importantinformation related to their interests , and nearly all of my friendsthat have visited a library are still alive . a little over half . anyway , i do not see what the panic is about ! cecil : no , carlos , listen to yourself . this is ... this is insane ! carlos : perhaps , you know , cecil , but ... as the great mathematician alberteinstein once said , ` ` the definition of insanity is available insidethis cave . come inside this cave . come inside this cave and the definition will be told to you , it is so nice inside this cave . '' cecil : true . no , carlos , even though there are no librarian where you are , i want you to be safe . or , better yet , come home soon . carlos : i ' ll see you again soon . i promise . cecil : i– i do not know what to do with myself without you . i love you . carlos : i love you too . and , you know , cecil , i ' ll be fine . i ' m a scientist.a scientist is always fine . cecil : well , listeners , i have to say , i certainly feel better having talked carlos ... even though i have learned absolutely nothing new about the escaped librarian . so , night vale , all i can tell you is to board up your doors and windows , turn out the lights , and – and do not answer your door for any reason . we do not yet know how long we must hide ourselves . and you must continue to live your lives . but , do so in a way thatdraws no attention , that requires no light , or motion . j shut downy our lives , dear listeners , for fear of losing them . just remove all semblance of living to prolong , for a few more moments , that emptylife . be safe , night vale . and i will do my best to keep bringing you the news . andrew : hello , cecil ? cecil : inter andrew ? well , it ' s wonderful to hear from you again . are you ... are you at the library ? andrew : uh , yes . i have found my way into the library , it ' s very dark inheres . the construction crew is standing over the collapsedscaffolding , poking at it with sticks and ordering it to put itselfback together again . their antennae are in the non-aggressiveposition , so i do not think they realize the danger they ' re in . cecil : ok . be careful , andrew , but also ... be closer to the story . be muchcloser and tell all of us what you see . andrew : uh , well , i ' m walking between the shelves , there are books all around . i do not feel safe around so many books . there are small wallowshere and there where librarian have nest ed for the night . some these look quite fresh . cecil : ok , move quietly . there could still be a librarian somewhere . andrew : there is ! there is a librarian ! ok , it ' s seen me . it has me trappedin the biography section . there are so many books here about helenhunt . i have no choice , i ' m go n na have to fight my way out of this . cecil : no ! no , you would never survive . just pretend that you do not exist and hope that the librarian shares your delusion . andrew : it ' s too late . it ' s too late . i have my fencing sword in my hand . saygoodbye to my mother . wherever she ' s buried herself after the mineclosed , i ' m go n na do her proud . cecil : ok , i will definitely find andrew : and say goodby to my best friend john and my second-best friendjamie , and my tied-for-third best friends xerxes and ha sad . wish themwell on their artisans upholstery business . cover those chairs , sweetest friends . cover those chairs . cecil : ok , i will ... i will do that ... andrew : and say goodby to the careless old woman who secretly lives in my home . i do not know what i would have done without her . well , probablymost of the same things i always did because i did not know she was there until she started running for mayor , and now i ' m not clear how she ' s secretly living anywhere mean , how is it a secret at this point ? cecil : huh . andrew : yeah , ask her that . cecil : all right . andrew : and – and – and kind of smirk while you ask her . cecil : oh . andrew : like , lean back , you know , cross your arms a little bit . cecil : like ... andrew : more ... cecil : rrrr ... andrew : ok , great . cecil : rrr ... . andrew : so ... so do that . do that for me . cecil : ok , i wi– i will do all of those things . andrew : wait ! and say goodby to cecil . cecil : what ? andrew : elohim his voice is like swimming in a clear , cold underground river . cecil : no , i'mcecil ! andrew : just tell him for me ! all right , i ' m going in . this will be a perilous and lengthystruggle . we ' ll be intertwined in a gruesome embrace until one of us dies . maybe hours from now , maybe days . for night vale ! aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh ! cecil : to the family of inter andrew we : he was a brave inter ... although not very knowledgeable about fencing swords and their completeinability to cut humanflesh , let alone librarian exoskeletons . and now , a public service announcement . thereafter night vale medical community is calling on all citizens please , give blood . there are always patients , unfortunate people , who need your help . sometimes there is a great natural disaster , like an earthquake or tornado , or even a great artificialdisaster , like scissors fog . but do not wait for these moments to giveblood . doctors need it every single day . never given blood before ? it ' s easy . the greater night vale medicalcommunity knows that many of you are afraid of needles . but there are so many non-needle ways to get your blood : court injunction , satellites , wolverines , a very carefully-staged ` ` accident ... '' please , put aside your rational fear of needles and pain and giveblood . this message has been brought to you by the greater night valemedical community , which ... ok , this is weird . listen , i ' m sorry , but i said that i would ask . the greater night vale medical community wanted me to tell you thatched think that you are cut e , and are you seeing anybody right now ? because , listen , i told them that you were , so that way there ' s pressure on you , ok ? but they still wanted me to ask , and they wherever persistent . you know what ? no . it ' s cool , i ' ll tell them that you are seeingsomebody , so there are no worries . listeners , i ' m starting to doubt if i ' m as alone as i thought in thisstudio . um , i thought it was only me , and the monitoring camera , and the camera that monitor the monitoring camera ... but i ' m beginning to feel something else . see something else . it ' s ... i ' m seeing ... facelessold woman who secretly lives in your home : cecil ? cecil : ahahah ! i think i know who this is ! facelessold woman : yes , it ' s me . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . cecil : of course . it is former mayor al candidate and hidden lurked watching all of us at all times , the careless old woman . um , well , it ' s lovely have you here . facelessold woman : i am not a former candidate . i do not accept the results of themayoral race , and i still consider myself your best choice for mayor wanted to make myself known to you and your listeners in this time of crisis to show how mayor al i am . it is very mayor al to stand neardisasters . i am very good at standing near things . i am less good at being seen , but i am working on that using a system of whistles and mirrors . cecil : huh . mirrors . well , let ' s talk about this . what would you , as presumptive mayor , have done differently with this librarian situation ? facelessold woman : oh , many things . mayor al things . profound and effective things . would have stood in the corners of dark rooms , shaking my head disappointment . i would have taken the un eaten lecture from yourcrisper and stapled it to your couch cushions . i would have filledevery dresser drawer with damp autumn leaves and uneasy dreams . cecil : hm m . facelessold woman : i would have written the date of your death in blue highlight on all of your shoes . there ' s a lot you can do as mayor if you just stop and think . if you just stop all time , and think for centuries on problem while linear progression ceases and you continue to age on separate plane of existence . cecil : and all of this would help get rid of the librarian on the loose insight vale ? facelessold woman : what ? oh , no , i do not care about that . that was just a list of things would do regardless of intentions or consequences . librarian are pretty awful , but i can always hide . i live secretly your home , not obstreperously like the rest of you , chewing loudly and playing brass instruments and stomping around in thick bootsthrough a haze of television chatter and sublimate sadness . also , stop being so self conscious about your weight . your shirts area ll a full size too big . i ' ve cut them into fabric strips and made ottoman of them . cecil : well , uh , careless old woman who secretly but l– listen . is there a shorter name that i can call you , by the way ? facelessold woman : yes . cecil : oh ! what is it ? facelessold woman : i ' ll whisper it into your ear . cecil : uh ? ohhh ... really ? facelessold woman : do not tell ! cecil : ok , i wo not ! facelessold woman : do not tell ! cecil : ok . all right , all right . well . careless old woman who secretly lives in your home , uh , even you are safe from librarian , um , should not your top concern asmayoral candidate be for the safety of your constituents ? facelessold woman : yes , it should . but ` ` should '' and ` ` is '' are different words for many reasons . spelling is one reason ; there are other reasons . it'sunderstandable you ' re alarmed , but ... it ' s also quite dull . i ' m boredwith your fear . i want to talk about the death you can not see , the dangers you do not fear because you do not know . that is interesting me . cecil : now , what dangers do we not see ? please , please tell us . ok , she ' s whispering in my ear again ... what ? him ? oh , he ' s so sweet ! what her , too ? oh , that ' s awful . oh , i actually do not know him . facelessold woman : well , most doctors do not even know how to stop the swelling or stench all . cecil : oh , that ' s terrible , careless old woman ! facelessold woman : you meant ` ` interesting . '' you said ` ` terrible , '' you meant '' interesting . '' look , it ' s all going to be ok . cecil : it will ? how ? facelessold woman : well , it actually wo not be . i was lying . but do not worry , i ' ll always there for you . cecil : oh , well that ' s very sweet of you , careless old woman ! facelessold woman : oh , look . diane creighton has throat spiders . i need to see this . cecil : hello ? hello ? well , it seems like she ' s gone again . listeners , the worst has just happened . we are getting reports that a librarian has entered a theater . thankful , you are not one of those doomedsouls who risked their lives for something as useless as live theater ! ha ha ha ! ah h , ha ha ! ah h . but let us all , as an exercise in empathy , imagine what it would be like to be one of those unfortunates in their last oblivious moments.imagine you are in a theater . imagine rows of seats . imagine a stage.imagine amplification , and the person seated a row behind you consistently whispering to their friend . picture this . pictureyourself as you would never be , in a crowd of listening strangers . now , imagine the librarian in the theater , not yet spotted in the dark of the house . imagine it glittering silently beneath the theaterseats . what if , hypothetical theater-goer , it were under the seatthat you were in right now ? don'tlook ! do not look ! if it saw you , what would it decide to do to you ? ok , there is safety in numbers . everyone at once , now , look ! there ' s nothing there ! you are safe in your imagined theater senator , maybe , the librarian anticipated your movement and slipped out of view just as you looked . that is a possibility , too . what wonderful about this world is that anything is possible . anythingthat can eventually result in your death is possible . oh . was that a dry , sca led hand upon your shoulder ? no , not that shoulder . no , it ' s the other one . yeah . it ' s ... oh . ooohhhh . it keeps moving back and forth . and you begin to feelbreath faintly on the back of your neck . so faintly that you dismiss it , over and over until it dismissed you for good . and one by one by one , people are disappearing from their theaterseats without a sound , just a flash of red and a dark stain . and yourbrain adjust for this by remembering those seats as always havingbeen empty and moist . another , then the screams start . first the left side of the theater ! another the right side of the theater ! and the entire theater screaming ! and one person in the front row stands up , and they are tearing at their hair , and they are howling ! await ! wait ! the entirefront row stands up , and the entire front row is clutching at theirchests , and they are screaming louder than the entire theatercombined ! and then , there is silence . utter silence . and the front row sits down . and the silence is worse than the screams . and no one is sayinganything at all . and no one is making the slightest move . and the librarian ... it is above them . do not look up ! and the librarian begins to descend , perhaps on a web , perhaps on great black wings , perhaps with its tendrils wrapped around the walls and the beams of the theater and it ' s jaws begin to open and itfocuses on one single person . do not look up ! and while that person waits , unknowingly , to get taken , i take all you , safe at home of course , not actually helpless in a theater , to the weather ! cecil : listeners , good news ! i mean , the news was always good for you , safe at home , with only a few hidden entities lurking around you ( and none of them quite as dangerous as librarian ) but , the news surprisingly also good for those screaming victims t rapped in the theater . the librarian have been recaptured . not by the sheriff ' s secret police , not by tamika lynn and her valiant band of well-read child vigilantes , but by the librariansthemselves . we have learned that the initial escapee was named randall , and we have also learned that randall was trying to leave his job as librarian . he was curious about all the other jobs in the world , as he had been born a librarian and had only ever known the secret evils and dark magic of library science . randall wanted to know what it would be like to work as construction contractor , an auto body mechanics , a food co op manager , a municipal park employee , a hooded figure . there is a whole world occupations and opportunities in america . ` ` it is a free country , '' we regularly explain to ourselves , without quite knowing what we mean . and randall even slipped into a theater to find out what it might be like to be a folk singer , or an actor , or an usher , or just a regularperson – just a human , filled with regret and worry , trying to find moment outside of themselves by watching a live performance . butte librarian , knowing that they are not human ( far from it ) , foundrandall and brought him back to the library . for while they are terrible , bloodthirsty pseudo reptilians , librarian are also quiteorganized . just as they would never want a highly-researchednonfiction travel guide like stephen king ' s the dark towerseries to end up in , say , fiction , or a sci-fi fantasy comic booklike pat convoy ' s the prince of tides to end up in religious studies , librarian also know that they shouldnever be seen or felt or heard outside of a library . librarian knowthat they can not enter society and coexist with humans withoutsuccumbing to intense hunger and curiosity and ... tearing us all intopink pulp piles of post-existence . so , they dragged unhappy randall from the theater , along with couple of collateral audience members . and the people in the theater were filled with relief , and shakingwith the echo of their terror . and they each turned to a personseated near them – not a person that they came with – they eachturned to a complete stranger and they said , to that stranger , ` ` you are alive for now . '' and then they said , to that stranger , ` ` congratulations . '' and thenthey shared a couple of moments of eye contact to acknowledge theunlikelihood of that claim . one ... two ... and then they turned away , uncomfortable with all thateyeballs and vision might imply , and then they said , to thatstranger , ` ` well , it was nice to meet you . '' and then , each one of them said , ` ` my name ' s amanda , '' even though very few of them wereactually named amanda . very few . then the show went on , and that moment of exchange hung between all the strangers in the audience , latent , and invisible . perhaps to bereprised later , or perhaps already only existing in the poorreconstruction of memory . as usual , we had nothing to fear . and , in saying that , i mean we haveeverythingto fear . death is slot ted for us all , and maybe it is years from now – in as oft bed , surrounded by the soft eyes of the people that we love – or , maybe , it is not so many years from now at all . and we have everyreason to be afraid . but we also need to learn to put that fearaside , like a library book . sometimes we need to check out our fear , and – and – and read it , and – and study it and pe ruse it closely , but at a certain point return it to its proper shelf and experiencesomething else . contentment . worry . calm . hunger . spinal parasites . and a great deal of love , of every kind . so put that fear in a place where you can find it when you need it , but do not carry it with you ! do not carry it with you . stay tuned next for a shuffling movement outwards , the dimming flights , and a large hall left empty and silent until the next time it is not . good night to all of you , listeners . and good night , night vale . good night . megbashwiner : welcome to night vale is a production of commonplace books . it is written by joseph f ink and geoffrey cranor . original music by disposition , led by john bernstein , featuringdeepthi welaratna , val erie eve ring , kyra simms , and dan harpaz . today ' s weather was ` ` serpentine cycle of money '' by dan ny schmidt and carried elkins . the voice of inter andrew was andrew we . the voice of deb was meg bashwiner . the voice of tamika lynn was symphony sanders . the voice of michelle nguyen was kate jones . the voice of steve carlsberg was ha l dublin . the voice of carlos was new york city ' s own dylan marrow . the voice of the careless old woman was ma ra wilson . the voice of night vale is cecil baldwin . today'sproverb : to quote the great her man neville , ` ` call me .

WTNV|WE MUST GIVE PRAISE|15 March 2015|do not judge a book by its cover . judge it by the harmful messages contains . welcome to night vale . the enormous glowing cloud that serves as president of the night valeschool board announced a five-year strategic plan for the schooldistrict . the plan , put together over the past year by thetwelve-member board , lays out new curriculum goals , organizationalrestructuring , and a comprehensive outline for eternal penitencebefore the mighty glow cloud . everyone present at the press conference fell to their knees appraised the glow cloud – their eyes solid white , gray smoke wispsswirling from their chanting mouths , hands clapping loudly in unison as miniature glowing colourful clouds swept about them . ` ` children are our future ! '' the glow cloud said . ` ` we must give praise ! give our lives ! give our all to the child of the glowing cloud ! to the schon of incorporeal rule ! all hail ! all hail ! all hail ! '' the crowd chant ed along in worship of the glow cloud ' s child , who currently a fresh man at night vale high school . the young cloud is inactive member of both show choir and the speechless debate team.their education has long been an important part of the adult glowcloud ' s leadership in the education community . the sheriff ' s secret police , in conjunction with several vague , yet menacing , government agencies , are calling on all citizens to be on the lookout for two fugitives . both hiram mcdaniels and the facelessold woman who secretly lives in your home are wanted by authorities for their recent attempts to usurp mayor al control of night vale . hiram is described as literally a five-headed dragon . he is feet tall , and his heads are colored blue , green , gold , gray , and purple . they each have their own personality , sentence , memory , indistinct markings and features . the gray head often feels blue , and wears a green nose ring . the blushed considers logic the gold standard of intellect , and has purpleeyes . the gold head is actually more of a sable , and will talk ‘ til he ' s blue in the face . the purple head has grown gray with paranoidfantasies and wears a gold neck chain that has a peasant with theory ` ` violet '' written in green gem stones . and the green head is the real shouty one that wants to set everyone on fire , all the time . the secret police are also on the hunt for the careless old woman , whom they describe as ` ` an elderly female without a face although , no one has ever actually seen her , so we ' re all justguessing . but , you ' ll know you ' re near her if you ' re at home.particularly if you ' re home alone and it ' s dark , and you think you hear breathing and creaking steps in another room . under circumstances should you look . do not look . you will not at all like what you see , '' the secret police said . there is a reward for information leading to the arrest of either these fugitives . that reward is a gift card to pier 1 , a lifetime of gratitude , and a couple of handwritten coupon for things likewashing the dishes , or a ten-minute back rub . um , a couple of listeners have asked how my boyfriend carlos is doing.he ' s still working on lots of interesting science projects in thatdesert otherworld . it ' s been almost a year since i last saw him in person , and i miss him a lot . i ' m waiting to hear back from stationmanagement about getting vacation time so i can go visit him . it'snearly impossible to get approved for vacation and , even if you do , you never know when or how you will find out . at most business es , you just file some simple paperwork or ask yourdirect supervisor , and after a few days they have someone from humanresources hide in the back seat of your car , and when you ' re halfwayhome they grab your face from behind , covering your eyes with offhand and mouth with the other and shout ` ` your vacation has beenapproved , congratulations ! '' and then , in your excitement , you taketh out for ice cream . but not in community radio . you can wait weeks , or months , to hear backing the meantime , though , i ' ve been taking up watercolors again , and id id something i ' ve never done for anyone else i ' ve ever been with . painted a picture of carlos . he ' s in profile , looking across his desert otherworld , he ' s wearing his karl lagerfeld-designed lab coat , and there ' s a car-sized bichon frise at op a du ne behind him . and it might be the best painting i ' ve ever made . i had long given this old hobby , and lately i ' ve grown so ... oh , i do not know ... out touch ? lost ? disconnected ? i just needed something to occupy my time . anyway , i hung it above my desk , near the window , and i tell you , it reallygets me through the days , seeing my paste carlos in his brush-sweptotherworld paradise . let'stake a look now at the community calendar . thursdaynight , dark owl records will be holding an open mi c for anyone who promises not to play any music , perform any poetry or comedy , or produce any kind of art at all . dark owl owner michelle nguyen says she hopes to not have to listen to or see any more art for as long as she lives , which she is sure will be for a really long time . ` ` it'staking forever , this life ! '' nguyen said , before inserting an all free internet for 30 days disc into her antique cd player . ` ` this is the only thing i can listen to anymore , '' nguyen added . fridaymorning , the society for a blood space war will be traveling back intima and eliminating several future enemies before they gain training and grow powerful . according to the group ' s press kit , friday is the official day of the event , but since they ' ll be traveling back intima , it ' s kind of moot because they ' ve already done it . it ' s justthat they recently hired a new or manager , and he ' s being all , like , '' you ca not announce an event without a date . '' anyway , they ' ll have preemptively assassinated all future enemy leaders friday morning . well , this certainly explains the people in space suits who broke into outbreak room here at the station last week and started a laser knifebattle with two folks from finance and our new inter , hannah re ff who , it turns out , had some pretty sick laser knife fighting skills.the finance folks went down easy , but hannah managed to fight two of her attacker off before the three remaining intruder grabbed herald jumped en sacrificing masse into the temporary black hole they had created near the coffee maker , thus ending hannah ' s future reign of space terror . to the family of inter hannah , she was a very good inter . veryfocused , and always a friendly presence here in the office . she was also a future parlor in the blood space war , but ... you could not haveknown that . only hannah could have . she will be missed . whereas i ? oh . *ahem* saturdayafternoon on the great lawn is the ennui fair , sponsored by the lastbank of night vale . there will be some gouty clowns , indifferent tosimplistic balloon shapes of dogs . there will be local merchants and artisans , standing hopelessly in small lots where they should be setting up booths to showcase their wares , but ca not bring themselves do so because they ' ve lost the thread ... not just of the fair , but of their careers and lives . organizerssay they expect cold rain that day , so you should ... ... another their press release just trails off . sunday , all day , is the first annual ultimate friable tournament at thesoftball and field hockey grounds , which were discovered last fall byarchaeologists over near the olive garden in the problematical birdsdistrict . the archaeologists determined this ancient site was builtover four years ago by natives of this town , who enjoyed outdooractivities like amateur football and field hockey . tuesdayafternoon is a pretty decent classic rock song . it has just been reported to me that the night vale pta is upset about the strategic plan created by the night vale school board . gordonmoreno , president of the pta , issued a statement criticizing the school board for not consulting parents and teachers when craftingthese changes . joined treasurer diane creighton , whose son josh is a th grader at news , and secretary ... steve carlsberg ... whose stepdaughter janice is in 2ndgrade , more no said the school board once again showed its lack of care for parental input into the education and development of its students . ` ` parent'svoices must be heard , '' more no shouted from at op the statue immortal film actor lee margin . sitting on margin ' s shoulders , legsdangling like a denim-wrapped flesh scarf from the bronze sculpturesmuscular neck , more no called for more transparent in educationplanning . morenothen clenched his teeth and lips and eyes as he kicked his legs back and forth in a groaning , full body antrum . let'stake a look at financial news . 2,921is a number . which is up from many other numbers , definitely up , so you should get really excited ... or , perhaps , really upset over this . also , the following words : crime , debt , capital , offering , and portfolio.write those down and learn what they mean . do not remember anythingthat you learn , but seek the memory of what you learn in dreams . here'sanother number : 9.8 billion . that ' s a very large number , one of thelargestnumbers . loose your jaw and breathe in slowly through your nose when you hear a number like that . 9.8 billion . that ' s ` ` billion , '' with two ls . billion.wow ! thighs been financial news . johnpeters – you know , the farmer ? – called today to say he noticedthat frank chen has returned to town . some of you recall that frank went missing a while back , and a little overt wo years ago his body was found by four kid s who followed a railroadtrack . chen ' s body was covered in extensive claw marks and burns , most likely caused – according to the coroner ' s report – by large dragon . anyway , john said he ' s seen frank driving around town in his pick up truck , doing some freelance construction work with a focus on carpentry and restoration , just like he always did when he was alive . john saidfrank looks good . ` ` he'sreal tall now . and rotund , '' john said from at op a telephone pole , where he d jimmied up a phone directly into the active lines . ` ` go ta tail and bunch of colourful heads now . also he got one of themcrossover toolboxes and a class 4 adjustable hit ch for his truck , '' john said , sounding impressed . ` ` guess death is not the end , '' john added . ` ` we all have to live on in some way . maybe it ' s in the legacy we leave , or the memories otherpeople keep of us , or the feeling they have when they hear our names a stolen identity taken by someone still alive . or just actualphysical immortality . it ' s all a shame . whatever it is . such a damnshame , everything is , i tell you . '' another there was a loud buzz , and a static pop , and a dial tone . another a different voice said , ` ` you can hang up the phone now , cecil . '' and i said , ` ` ok , lacy . fine . '' we'vejust received word that the school board has rejected the pta'srequest for more transparent in long term strategic planning . the president of the school board and enormous glowing cloud cited schooldistrict code 25.3b-2 , which states ` ` all hail ! all hail the mighty glow cloud ! you are weak ! you are nothing ! you must bow down and give praise to the glow cloud ! ` ` as well as code 17.2a , which explicitly defines the powers of the school board president as ` ` omnipotence ! omniscience ! obstreperous ! infinite ! ` ` – and that ' s exactly what it says . it even has that revert effectwhen you read it . ptapresident more no , knowing he had very little beverage in his request for power of legislative review , decided to change his strategy into request for forgiveness from the angry pulling cloud . animals beganfalling from the sky with heavy thumbs and splats and splashed . threat lawn has grown dark with carcasses and shadows as pta officers run in search of cover . i'veheard from my friend , diane creighton , that she huddled underneath the lee margin statue , and that the lifetime bronze form of our nation ' s greatest living actor has done a tremendous job of blocking the various black bears and nurse sparks and ostrich falling violently to earth . th eglow cloud has spread wide across the sky , blotting out importantthings like spy satellites and helicopter , as well as unimportantthings like the moon and the illusions of mountains near the horizon.from right here in the studio , i can see the darkness spreading . it looks like this is as good a time as any to take you to the weath– what was that ? what the ... was that ? the school board and the pta have reached a compromise . the pta ' s earliergrievance that long-term curriculum and school district planninglacked transparent has been heard . and while the glow cloud and the school board could not offer complete openness and inclusion in all school district decisions for the pta , they could offer to stopdropping dead animals on everyone , if the pta never mentionedtransparency or questioned authority again . ptapresident more no agreed to these terms , panting , ` ` yeah . oh , yeah , sure . never again . please , just let us be . please ! '' thence breathlessly repeated ` ` all hail , all hail , all hail , '' as thickresidue of some fallen beast dropped slowly off his swollen face antonio his torn shirt . dianecreighton , safe beneath the lee margin statue , asked , ` ` perhaps apt liaison on the school board would be ... '' but more no jumped in . ` ` no.no liaison . we are fine , diane , we must give praise ! '' anddiane did not say a word . but she said a lot . more no did not acknowledge the look in diane ' s eyes . stevecarlsberg then added ... oh , i do not know , it does not matter . i ' m sure he added something.steve always does . hope you are all safe , dear listeners . i hope you are all ok . i knowi am safe . sadly , though , i am not ok . the falling animal carcasses collapsed a smallsection of the outer wall around our radio station . no one was injured , but it was the wall where my desk was . my new painting . had spent so long on it . i mean , i can replace it , but ... it ' s justthat . it ' s ... just that it brought me such happiness , such a reason to get up , such little joys . like , it ' s not hard to find images of carlos , we have science , with its phone and screens and psychic projections , and ... but thatpicture it was art . creation . destroyed . i mean , i can paint another . i can can just paint another . it'llbe fine . just an excuse to do some fun painting . i ' m glad we ' re all ok . diane ' s ok , even steve , i ' m glad he ' s ok too , i can just paint ... it'sfine . yup.everything ' s fine . staytuned next for the qui z show ask me another but i ' ll never talk , you fiend , i ' ll never talk . it ' s our most popular new program . an das always , good night , night vale . good night . today'sproverb : do not bring a gun to a knife fight . do not bring a knife a knife fight , either . stop going to knife fights altogether.what ' s your deal with knife fights ?

'' and so then the bar tender , who is also horse , ‘ cause , you know , this is the horse district where theories live when they ' re not being used by the humans , and the horsebartender says , ` ` do not i know it , bud dy !

WTNV|worms...|15 April 2015|we all lie readily upon damp earth , spotting clouds shaped like animals we have yet to invent . welcome to night vale . if you woke up today , you ' re probablyalready well aware of the worms . it ' s been about 12 years since the last round of worm-based terror in this town , but ... they ' re back.they ' re doing all of the usual worm things : flying around and dropping trees onto cars and houses , spitting venom at people , animating stray cats and then leaving large mewling pellets all abouttown . thousands of worms have managed to completely envelope the rec center annex , which is where today'scontinuing education course , counter-terrorism technique forbeginners , was taking place . sadly , despite frequent pleas by many classify worm attacks as terrorist , worms remain classified as alow-grade infestation – and thus were not covered in today'scontinuing education coursework . this means more giant squirmingpellets to clean up . um , yeah , yeah ... worms ... worms , worms , worms ... great . hey . unrelated to anything , justwondering , but ... have you ever asked yourself why the dog park is off limits ? i mean , i know it ' s a municipal park and all , but shouldn'tcitizens be able to use it ? seems kind of weird , right ? that you ca not just go to the dog park and hang out . maybe even ... bring your dog ? i do not know . it ' s not like it contains any kind of vast desert otherworld where boyfriend lives , it ' s ... i ' m surest ' s just a plain old dog park and not an alt-dimensional portal ! maybe our mayor will try to open up the dog park for public use.just ... temporarily . say , for a few minutes . maybe our mayor can help me out for once . thatwould certainly be a friendly and mayor al thing to do . afteryears of applications for city approval , there is finally an officialnight vale book club , listeners ! the book club , which is run by 14year-old bibliophile and heroic vigilante tamika lynn , will featureweekly discussions of popular and classic fiction , as well as q & as with book experts about some of literature ' s most famouscontroversies. , like last week ' s heated argument about whether or nothermanmelville really wrote all of the novels which bear his name , or just fightclub . ebook club meets tuesdays from 2:00pm to 4:00pm at patty ' s hardware and discount pas tries . members can candidly discuss the books withoutfear of mostgovernment repercussions , while nothing on some delicious wheat and wheat byproduct-free pas tries sold at great discount to you . patty ' s alsospecializes in hammer , crowbars , and anything heavy that fits in your hand and can be easily swung . ` ` shop at patty ' s . they ' ll never suspect a thing ! '' patty shouts in the loopedrecording playing from her perpetually squirming animatronic statue out front of her flags hip store . thisweek ' s book is helen deity ' s the last samurai . there is only one heavily-charred edition of thisnovel left in the world , but tamika assures us that she managed ...

'' ( with a lower-case w followed by anellipses ) to ` ` worms ! ! '' ( with a capital w and two exclamationpoints ) . it has not yet reached all-caps ` ` worms ! ! ! '' but , something is not done , this could become a more destructive ` ` worms ! ! ` ` outbreak than the famous with all caps , one exclamation point , and underlined-twice disaster of 1997. you know , listeners , if the worms get near the dog park , um , perhaps the hoodedfigures who pace about behind the tall black fences would get distracted . and then i could ... run in there , and get to the desertotherw– ha ... i– i ... i could just go check out the dogs ! catchingtennis balls , and – and have a nice afternoon in a local park . or ... actually , no . no . i d make a break for the desert otherworld inside the dog park , and finally go visit carlos . or ... you know.something . and now , a wordforms our sponsors . too much clutterin your home ? do you have excess furniture ? old clothes ? a couple of folding bikes you never ride anymore ? jazz cds that you no longerwant because you finally realized how intellectual dangerous thecal be ? perhaps you couldst that stuff online for sale ! there ' s no reason to let old junk go to waste . how does that saying go ? ` ` one person'strash is another person ' s leather bodysuit ? '' it ' s true ! i bet thatcouch of yours would look really good in , say , dense esposito'shouse . in fact , it ' s there now . we went ahead and sold your couch todenise . she ' s already come and picked it up while you were at work . also , we soldyour to to sally jensen , and your fridge to ma rio lands , and both of your cats to pedro renia . we sold all of your belongings , and sordid not have to do a thing ! craigslist . we sold your stuff while you were gone . due to today'sworm attacks , the sheriff ' s secret police are putting their search on hold for literal five-headed dragon hiram mcdaniels and the facelessold woman who secretly lives in your home . after the attempted coup at city hall several weeks back , the secret police have beenaggressively pursuing the two fugitives , who have reportedlyconspired many times to overthrow mayor dana cardinal . mayor cardinal has been imperilled several times in the last month , only to be saved someone controlling night vale community radio host cecilpalmer ... who is still quite upset about being used against his will . ` ` if the mayor had just asked for my help , i would have happily come to her aid only own , '' a frustrated palmer said , just now , into this verymicrophone . palmer allegesthat mayor cardinal purchased him last year in an auction , and hasten using him as her personal protector . the mayor has denied thesecharges – but , like the night vale constitution says , denying that you are guilty is a major sign of guilt . the secret policeman previously wanted against approaching either hiram or thefaceless old woman , as they are both deadly . but , the secret policehave been so busy dealing with the worms today , that they just can'tdeal with everything on their own . ` ` maybe you could ... help us out a bit , you think ? '' a secret police spokespersonsaid , as worms gripped his legs tighter . ` ` i– i'm– i ' m surveyor ' ll be fine . if you could find either the 18-foot tall , five-headed dragon , or the omnipresent eternal woman who you can'tquite ever see , go ahead ! bring them down ! thanks for doing that . big help . big help , '' the spokesperson said as the worm consumed , with one slim gulp , the class in his left hand . the secret police added they received a tip from night vale human frankchen that he saw hiram mcdaniels flying far away , to some otherplace . and so , chen said , hiram is definitely not still in night vale . ` ` hiram ain'tcomin ' ‘ round here anymore . i ' m sure of it !

'' chen ' s blue head said . ` ` uh , i mean , i am human , ok ? '' chen ' s gray head said . ` ` knock it off , you guy s ! '' chen ' s purple head grumbled , from behind the otherheads . speaking of thefaceless old woman , she knows a lot about this town . i bet i couldst her how to get into the dog park , how to get into that desertotherworld . i should ask her , but i ' m not sure i ' ll be able to find ... careless old woman : ask me what ? cecil : oh ! ha h ! careless old woman , you ... you scared me . careless old woman : i know . so , you want to go to the desert otherworld and visit yourboyfriend ? cecil : well , i do ... careless old woman : you are upset that the mayor has been using you to protect her fromthose wonderful threats to her life , and you ' re frustrated by thistown . and you just want some time away to clear your head , and so you do not have to always be saving the mayor from whatever great forces are trying to remove her from office . cecil : well , that ' s ... careless old woman : and by ` ` great , '' i mean ` ` really incredible . '' of course , whoever knows who ' s been doing all this to the mayor ? i mean , know . i know everything . but ... all of these delightful rumors and lies about me and hiram ... i mean , how can people even report suchrumors ? well , they ' re not totally untrue , i suppose . and how on earthcould i even get ... cecil : but , careless old woman , is careless old woman : yes . i ' m sorry . i ' m a bit distracted . cecil : you know how to get into the dog park . careless old woman : i do . and i want to help you , because ... well , i want you to be happy , cecil . i will tell you how in a dream . you will be in a boat which will sink , of course – and you will lose all of your teeth.and as you are trying to pick up your teeth , you will find an oil painting of a victoria . you will then place the needle on the record and eat the entire painting . your chest will open , and dozens of red birds with gold ribbons in their salons will fly from you , and the ribbons will lift your limp , open body , carrying you through the sea and dropping you onto a frantic eddy of pink fish near a pink reef.you must wake immediately when you see the shadow of a young womanemerging from behind the coral . do not look long at her . when you awake , you will hear her whisper . cecil : and she will tell me how to get into the dog park ? careless old woman : i do not know what she will tell you . cecil : well , careless old woman ... careless old woman : i have to go . i have to get back to keeping a distant eye on whatever is that chad is doing in that cursed home of his . you ' ll be fine.night vale will be fine . the mayor will be ... take a nice , longbreak , cecil . you ' ve earned it . cecil : careless old woman ? hello ? she ' s gone , think . listeners ? oh , dear . i have made a bad mistake . i believe i have upset station management . i think my openlytalking about the dog park has proved to be far too political a topic for this station ' s old-fashioned values that believe in not questioning local , world , or secret reptilian governments , nor theirparks . i have growncavalier in my anxiousness to get out of town for a vacation , and this lack of care in my job , perhaps , will lead to my end ! i do not like the color glowing around my studio door right now . i do not lithe predatorial sniffing around the door ' s edge . i do not like chatham , nor the heat of my skin , nor the cold in my heart . i can not faceted , listeners ! i can not ! i just want a vacation ! i just want to see carlos , for a week ! a day ! a ... an envelope ! oh , no ! the noised the lights are gone ! all that is left is a black envelope , uponwhich is a single silver lymph , lightly fire . i ... i do not recognize the language , nor even the alphabet of this burning symbol . but know , in my mind , exactly what this says . i wish i did not know . i must havecourage . i must open this frightful news . before i do , let me say i am sorry to station management , and to the city of night vale . have ... betrayed your trust with my careless speech . if spared , promise to never speak ill nor question the dog park again , but ... for now , i will take myself to my punishment . and i will take you to the weather . so ... guesswhat ? the envelope was not about the dog park at all . i fell to knees , begging station management for forgiveness , but they silenced immediately . they were simply letting me know that my vacation had finally been approved ! i was confused for a moment . i asked about the burning lymph on the outside of the envelope and what i thought it meant – which took some explaining , as i did not know how to describe that particular horrifyingexperience in english . and they laughed , and said , ` ` no , that glyphis just the ancient abbreviations for human resources . they ' re who approve the vacation around here . '' thenthey showed me the actualglyph that meant what i thought the throne meant , and i lost consciousness . i ' m not sure for how long . when i woke , heard the whispered instructions from the woman in the coral ! and then i heardlaughter . station management was ... laughing ! and i laughed , too ! another they stopped laughing , or ... growling ? perhaps it was growlingthey were doing . it ' s very difficult to say what that noise is theymake . oh . wo w . yeah , think it was growling . aw , now i ' m superembarrassed about laughing . anyway , the worms . *ahem* the worms have backed down , thanks to a flamethrower and fierce rhetoric the city council , resulting in some sick burns ... bothmetaphorically and literally . the worms have left , sure to return for us again someday as all of nature eventually will . friends , listeners , all of night vale ... i love you . very much . but i need timeaway to be with carlos . yes . and , also , sometime to myself . to reflect . also , i got a message from arnold ... colleague ? acquaintance ? genesis ? who lives there as well . you know , i don'twant to talk about it just yet . nightmare , we ' ve had many great years together . and i wo not be gone long , but ... i ' ve also grown ... weary . weary of some friends who are lessthan friends . weary of fights that need not be fought . weary of not being myself some of the time , which is something i strongly prefer to be all of the time.weary , sometimes , of night vale itself , i think . i ' ll be back.whenever . refreshed ... you ' ll know when ! it ' ll be when you hear voice again ! stay tuned next for ... oh , i do not know ! anyway , time for a vacation ! good night , nightmare . good night ! whoo-hoo ! today ' s proverb : when you wishupon a star , your dreams come true . but , because of distance , not for millions of years .

not me ! but it just seems that way . that that ' s all . it'snew year ' s eve , 1934. and here in night vale , as in towns all overt his great country , we are celebrating with large swimming pools full of champagne . this is both fun and also practical , since we have way more champagne than we can drink or even safely store without the towering stacks of champagne crates threatening to tumble down contour fragile bodies . so , what better way of honoring the season than just dumping a ton of this stuff into a swimming pool and splashing around it it ? turns out , it ' s not great for swimming in , what with the alcohol content and aridity . but , it'sok , because we have pool float made from compact ed cavity . everyone here , and everyone is having a blast . even little josie ortiz , young as she is , is getting in on the act , entertaining swimmer withsimple magic tricks and minor prophesied . this is the best partynight vale has had since last week ' s big blow out in honor of leemarvin ' s 30 th birthday . as look out over the lush grassland and the verdant trees sagging withtropical fruit , an area that just a few years ago was flat emptydesert forever , i feel the warmth inside , that american warmth thatgives me great certainty . it will be this way from now to always.from now on , peace . from now on , prosperity . from now on , champagneswimming pools every new year ' s . americans taking flight , and hard working people are its wings . back to you as always , leonard ! always . i genuinely ca not remember a time you did not have that job ! leonard : of course , just a few years later , the trees and grassland were gone , the second war had hit europe , and all of night vale came together to make explosive and devices to launch explosives . nothing shows the beautiful perfection of human community like intercontinentalweaponized combat . it was a better time then . this as also cecil ' s first ever broadcast as a full time host of thisshow . cecil : cry havoc , and let slip the hounds of war . weep havoc . squeeze grieflike coal to diamonds , until it slid es , crystalline and compact , downy our reddened cheeks , and let slip those ugly useless hounds to do their ugly useless work . welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . here i am , as i thought i might never be , behind the studio microphone at night vale community radio . yes , top news tonight is that our beloved leonard button has retired in order to spend more time trying to understand what a family is . and so i will , from now forward , take over as the voice of our littlecommunity . this is a proudly for me . and a proud day , i ' m sure , for my mother , who has beenhiding from me for decades now , but whose absence in many ways speaks me more than words could . with the big news out of the way , we go back to the usual day-to-day.there is , of course , a war in europe and the pacific , and all around the world . we ourselves have been attacked ... or , not we , night vale is still fine . but people who share our same broadcategory , somewhere , they ' ve been attacked . and that will not stand . nightmare is , of course , very tricky to leave , so no one has actuallyjoined the army or anything , but we are doing our part for america buying war bonds , growing victory gardens , and chanting in blood stone circles . leadingexperts say that it is the indomitable american spirit , the fightingprowess of our soldiers in the field , and mostly chanting in blood stone circles that will win this war . like those famous rose theriveter posters all over town say , ` ` get chanting in blood stonecircles double-time , or me and the rest of the riveters will come at you with rivet guns . you ever have someone come at you with a rivet gun ? well , bud , you do not want that . trust me . '' inspiringwords in difficult times . but when the turbulent events of the past few years have you down , justremember your friend cecil , behind the mi c and talking you through it from this day forward . leonard : huh . uh , while that clip was playing i found a few fidelipaccartridges that look pretty old . i do not remember pulling these for today ' s best of show . let ' s see what the first one is . it ' s marked '' the end ? '' ( question mark ) . cecil : nulogorsk , our russian sister city , is gone . the people of nulogorsk , our friends , they are gone too . sincethen , the sky has been hot with death . so much fuel for so manyrockets burning away at once , it makes the fall air seem a littlewarmer , even down here . not to mention that final sizzle at the end of each . bloomsof death all over the world , hot and final . speak to you for as long as i can from a world ending . 1983 : our final year . i suppose as good a year as any . josieortiz , once young , now middle aged , will never go on to be the old woman she could have become . leemarvin , famed screen actor , will die having outturned 30 , never to see another year pass . an di ? i will go , too . amidst a screaming of sirens that warn withouthelping , that make a show of protecting without protecting at all . will never meet that someone.that someone who could have given my life depth and meaning , who could have been my other . i will only ever sit here , only haveever sat here , behind this microphone , until i am not ever , ever , again . good night , from a world ending , night va – by all accounts , this is looking to be a good year ! at least as good as 1983 has been ! josieortiz would like me to remind everyone that this thursday , she is holding a benefit for the old opera house . it will be a lavishevening , with everything you would expect from a fancy night out , like a salad bar . tickets are $ 100 and are not for sale to the likes you . another news : simone rigadeau , professor of earth sciences at the nightmare community college , says that her reality has split , that she experiencing another history happening now . a history in which all of this ends . sheds shutting down the earth sciences program in order to devoteherself fully to understanding what has happened to her shatteredmind , and this ended – but yet also no tended – world . well , best of luck in your new career , simone ! leonard : oh yes , those were glorious days ! these days , the world seems to never be ending for some and not others . the world is a worse placenta than it ever was before , but far better than it ever will be again . the past is always better than the present , and the future is the worst of all . thisnext cartridge is marked ` ` weather . '' let ' s see what ' s on it . leonard : and i have one last clip here , there ' s a piece of duct tape on the plastic ca sing in which someone has written a thick , shaky ` ` no ! ` ` so let ' s play that . cecil : listeners , oh listeners , i ... i come to you with sad news . i– think you know the news . i– i– i think we all saw what happened . to the family and friends of former night vale community radio hostleonard button , i extend my deepest sympathies . not that sympathies will do you any good . for what leonard experienced is something that no human , no sentientbeing , should ever have to experience . the blood ! those stains on the broken shalt . the skin or ... i think that was skin ? but then , all those bits that were clearly goatskin , of course , and then all the more blood of course , and then the wretched sound of the pulling , and the single awful snap . we will all remember the sound of the snap forever . therein more , but i can not . ugh . there is more , but i wo not . and the fingernails . of course . of course , the fingernails . mourn leonard button with all my heart , and my liver , and kidneys , with the bones of my toes and with my belly button , i mourn him with my armpit , and neck sweat , every part of me . every facet . the physical of me . mourn him with these . leonardgave me my start . he took a chance on me . he gave me the life i have , and now he does not have life . it is an equation with a mis-writtennumber . nothing can be solved . it is an error . the city council warned that the mess left from leonard button ' s death is likely to draw street cleaner , and that we should all take shelter.cover your mirrors , shade your eyes , stay indoors , and mourn . stayindoors , and mourn . leonard'sdeath , and my barely-contained grief have been brought to you today shasta co la . shastacola : same great taste , low , low price . *ahem* and now , moving forward as best we can to political news , of course the focus now is on the big debate about president clinton . who is he ? uh , what ' s a president ? how did this strange news from the outsideworld reach our little desert hamlet ? forth at , let ' s bring in senior political analyst , lee margin , who ... oh ! look what day it is ! this is your 30 th birthday ! leonard : i ... ugh ... listeners , have you ever forgotten where you put your keys ? you were certainty were on the mantle but they were not ? have you ever missed appointment because you were sure it was on wednesday at noon , not tuesday at ten ? have you ever remembered a life you did not lead ? ha sa carefully collated series of words ever made you uncertain ? confident ? or un , just un ? un , as adjective unto itself ? id id not remember that story at all . i do not like that story . that isa bad story . it was a better day earlier , back when i had not heardthat story . this present , this now is no good . no good at all ! staytuned next for less of the best and more of the same . it ' s been pleasure to fill in this week , in my old job , night vale . cecil will be back soon . untilthen , this has been leonard button . an das always , see a , night vale . see a . today ' s proverb : ` ` i ' m all business , '' i say , peeling off my skin strip by strip , showing you what oozes out . business to my core .
WTNV|Faceless Old Woman|1 July 2013|get the body you ' ve always wanted . we know where it ' s buried , and can lend you shovel . welcome to nightmare . hello , listeners ' m back from vacation , and i ' m feeling great ! i , of course , miss being with carlos in that desert otherworld , and miss having so much time to relax with my boyfriend , but – as with any vacation – it always feels good to come home . we had such delightful time . carlos and the masked army of nomadic giants thatinhabit that place have managed to build a little paradise there.there ' s now a roller coster , and an ice cream parlor , and a beachresort hotel and s pa ! unfortunately , they do not have operators forth roller coster , nor any milk for making ice cream , nor any wateralong the beach resort . so , most of those things just sit empty . except for the roller coster , which is constantly running , and filled with the samepeople who got on it over two months ago , unable to stop because no one knew how to build a brake system . there were terrified screamsdopplering up and down the otherwise quiet nights . those people adjust having the time of the rest of their lives ! more on my triplater , but first , some breaking news . the sheriff'ssecret police just announced that they have captured the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . the careless old woman is one of two fugitives the secret police have been track ing for the paste months . she , and literal five-headed dragon hiram mcdaniels , recanted in connection with a series of attacks on mayor dana cardinal city hall . a secret policespokesdeer made today ' s big announcement by writing it in dirt wit hits hoof . the announcement began a couple of hours ago , but we'rejust now getting to the good stuff . and reporter have grownimpatient with the spokesdeer , who can only scratch one or two words at a time , and then has to era se them before continuing with the nextwords . the press conference turned ugly , as a couple of reporter shouted ` ` speakenglish ! '' at the deer . but then , a couple more shouted , '' по-русски ! ` ` and the spokesdeer , looking relieved , began speaking in fluentrussian – which flummoxed those reporter who only spoke english , despite their adamant demands that others develop a mastery multiple languages . but the big news is that they captured a dangerous fugitive , which is so shockingbecause , to my knowledge , no one has ever seen the facelessold woman who secretly lives in your home – because she lives theresecretly . of course , without a face , i imagine it would simultaneously easy and difficult to identify her . more on history as it develops . ok . so . back tour vacation . carlos showed me the apartment he built using his scientific knowledge of physicalmaterials and spatial relations . it was a cut e little one-bedroom on the side of a low craggy mountain . yeah , i know , could hardly believe it ! a mountain , right ? we took turnsmaking each other breakfast whenever we thought it was morning.carlos cooks a delicious began omelet using thick billets of gingerroot for the eggs , and filling it with dried cranberries and capers . i ' m not a greatcoat , but i make excellent coffee . i generally do not let carlos maketh coffee because i have a specific way i like to make it using coffee hammer and angry chanting . i like my coffee like i like my nights : dark , endless , and impossible to sleep through . after a week'sstay-cation in carlos ' apartment , we went with the giant maskedwarrior alesha on several hi king trails around the desert canyons.carlos and alesha showed me the brilliant array of flora that grows in that desert otherworld . while the desert around night vale mostly red and brown dust , with a scattering of white and brownrocks , topped with gray and brown brush , the canyons of the desertotherworld are flush with rich brush of charcoal and ta n , rocks the color of snow and leather , and dust that was striped in shades sunset and mahogany . and there weremysterious lights in the sky . just like here in night vale . we could not understand the lights , but we understood our lack understanding . which is all most understanding is . some mornings , alesha and doug and the other giant masked warriors would see othermasked armies , and they would head off to war , gone for days at time , only to return blooded – and fewer in number . carlos and id id not mind , because it gave us more time to ourselves . oh ! more about our vacation later , but there ' s some news , or something . an update today ' s arrest of the careless old woman : several residentsacross night vale are reporting vandalia inside their homes . old town residents christopher brandy and stewart robinson report theirliving room walls were covered in writing that reads , ` ` you talked ! i see you , and i can not hate you , but i can not forgive you . '' th etext seems to have been written with hand-smeared mayonnaise . also , all of the toes were cut out of their dress socks . said robinson of the damage , ` ` i think it ' s because i reported to the sheriff that the careless old woman who secretly lives in our home was secretlyliving in our home . i regret this now . '' brandy added , ` ` told you not to do that , stewart ! '' robinson thenreplied , head in his hands , ` ` i know , chris . you were right ! you'realways right . '' ` ` you should have listened to christopher , '' came a coldwhisper over their shoulders . stay tuned whereas we bring you more news of today ' s arrest . and now , it'stime for another edition of my popular advice segment , ` ` hey there , cecil . '' let ' s get to your questions . ` ` hey there , cecil ! i date a lot of people , but never for very long . i find thatwhile i sometimes say ‘ i love you ' to my girlfriend or boyfriend at the time , i do not think i have ever meant it . how do you know you ' re in love ? '' signed , loveless in the barista district . hey there , loveless . i think when you ' re truly in love , you ' ll know it . but you have to be in the right place with yourself to find that love . as my mother used to tell me , ` ` you ca not learn to love others until you learn that others are fiction , and that self is reliable . '' next question . ` ` hey there , cecil . my husband and i regularly host dinner parties for our neighbors , and vice versa . when our neighbors come over to the house , they never take off their shoes . i , personally , do not have a problemwith that , but my husband thinks it ' s rude . what ' s your take ? ` ` signed , un shod in old town . hey there , un shod . wh oo ! this is , uh , pretty clear cut to me . it is customary , when you enter a person ' s home , that you must always remove yourshoes . then you must remove their shoes . you must hold thatperson down , take their shoes – just get their shoes off ! this standard etiquette . we ' ve got time for one more question . ` ` hey there , cecil . do you know the tower ? the one that casts no shadow ? it alsosounds like an unturned cells ? do you know the one ? smells likesulfur ? well , it ' s glowing now . '' signed , malevolent in missiongrove park . hey there , malevolent . you know as well as i do , that tower was destroyed century ago . never write me again ! please write me again ! old woman josieand her friends , who are not angels – just a bunch of really tallpeople with wings named erika whom we can not bear to look directly at – said that the new old night vale opera house was coming alongnicely . although i drove past the construction site the other day , and it ' s still a mostly empty lot . the only difference is that theychanged the sign from ` ` josefina contractors , inch '' to ` ` strexcorpoperatics , ltd '' also , there ' s giant opera house there . but , other thanthat , it still looks nearly the same as when they broke ground months ago . opening night of the new old opera house will be june 15 th , and will feature the worldpremiere of an original opera by the famous actor and composer , leemarvin – night vale ' s own immortal legend of stage and screen . still no word on what opera is . uh , i ' m being told it ' s like petting z oo , but with fewer starving wolves . and moreintermissions . breaking newsfrom city hall as the sheriff ' s secret police say they have now arrested more than a dozen careless old women . the spokesdeer , stillspeaking in russian for the russian-speaking press , while alsowriting english words in the dirt for the embittered english-speakingpress , say that the careless old woman who secretly lives in yourhome seems to be several bodies connected to a single sentence . she seems not to be omnipresent at all ; merely multi-present . the secret policespokesdeer then laughed in russian , while writing ` ` helene '' english in the dirt . careless old woman : you ' re betraying me , cecil . cecil : oh ! oh dear , that's– that that ' s simply not true ! i– ok . nowhere ' s a ... very long insect ... crawling into my ear . um ... it ' s allah it ' s all the way in my ear now ! um , i am nook with this , careless old woman ! careless old woman ? ah ! aah ! listeners , hang on while i get this silverfish out of my ear canal . ok . ok . um , so ... traffic . um , it lookspretty bad out there . we ' ve got a jackknifed 18-wheeler on the shoulder of westbound route 800 near exit 4 , causing serious delays , and the bus depot on somerset , um ... a fire hydrant was cracked open , and now space and time have collar ok , i ' m sorry , listeners , i ... i ' m taking my headphones off . i'm– i ' m having a hardtime hearing myself . i think the careless old woman really did damage to my ear ! anyway , traffic ' s awful , of course . always is . do not driven somerset unless you want all of your matter collapsing into singularity . ugh , r– really glad to be home . great homecoming ! an update now on the multiple arrests of the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home : apparently they ' ve managed to find 15 more versions of her in homes all over town . but , according to the spokesdeer , the secretpolice are running out of room in the jails . also , even at themes where they have arrested these careless old women , there are still reported cases of vandalia , and whispers , and suggestedviolence , and sudden but inscrutable movements in the corners of vision . in fact , these reporter are happening even in homes where arrest of the careless old woman had already been made . many citybuildings , especially the secret police ' s secret police station , hidden in a hover cloud , have received quite a bit of damage : birdparts in filing cabinet , bullets replaced with worms , badges reading '' rotted meat '' instead of ` ` secret police . '' mayor danacardinal has called on the police to temporarily cease theircrackdown on the careless old woman . the mayor claims she ' s beenterrorized by falling television and window-mounted act units , swell as all of the carpet in her city hall office being replaced by dark , heaving fur , as if the floor were now the back of some terriblebeast . listeners , i'mnot falling for this bit again ! mayor cardinal , once my friend , has abused my good nature too much . she bought me at an auction , and has since been using me against my will to rescue her from danger . well , she ' s justgoing to have to figure it out on her own this time . careless old woman : i ' m here , cecil . she . ow ! gr – gross ! stop it , careless old woman , stop it ! weather . let ' s go to the weather . well . i havecotton swabs in both ears now , listeners , and am more than a little bit irritated . but on with the news . the secret policejust retracted their earlier reports that they had captured thefaceless old woman who secretly lives in your home . they thought they had been arresting several corporal forms of her across town , but inactuality they had just been arresting a bunch of careless old women who openly live in their own homes . it seems , in introspect , that thefaceless old woman who secretly lives in your home , still secretlylives in your home , and has never stopped tantalizing your home protest of these arrests of innocent women . these facelessold women are now filing a civil suit against the sheriff ' s secretpolice for unfair profiting practices against elderly women who happen to have no faces . and the sheriffjust issued the following public apology : ` ` non-specifically , my bad ! '' said the sheriff from his hover office in the clouds . ` ` in general , really sorry about all kinds of things . we ' re cool now , right ? '' the sheriff added before dissipating into tiny crystalline droplets , which fell gently , a silver moment to the hardened earth below . maybe i did speak too soon about being happy to be back home . oh . while i was reporting the weather , i received this voicemail from carlos : carlos : hi , babe ! i heard you were apparently off saving the mayor again justo . i ' m sorry i missed you . so ... i wanted to ask ... eh i– i was so afraid to ask while you were here because id id not want to complicate our peaceful vacation with difficultchoices , but ... uh , here goes . cecil , rememberthat building ? the simple rectangular building with the tall , pointed top and covered entirely in a tar p ? you asked several times whatthat tar p was covering and i said i did not want to say ... yet . and you remember the familiar-seeming man sea ring dark sun glasses with what lookedlike blood stains on his shirt but i assured you was just barbecuesauce ? well , he builtthat building under the tar p ! cecil , it ' s a radio station ! kevinbuilt a radio station ! he does not seem to be planning anything evil.in fact , he seems pretty relaxed and friendly these days ! he built it for anyone who wants to broadcast or listen to broadcast . and , it got me thinking , and i– i– i– i mean– you do not have decide now . and–and– you don't– you do not even have to decide ye sat all , but ... but – but – but – but would you ever thinkabout ... i– would you – would you ever consider ... ugh ! this is tough to ask on voicemail . just call me , okay ? call me when you ' re off the air . i love you . cecil : yes . yes , i would , carlos . i think i really would . it was so serenethere . so lovely . okay . private thoughtsdone , uh , let ' s turn my microphone back on now . well , listeners , i wonder what carlos might be trying to ask me ? i mean , it ' s probably nothing , and ... even if it was something , i do not think i would move away or anything . he he ... move away ? no one said anything about moving away ! who moves away ? i have to stickaround a bit , anyway , because my sister and brother-in-law are going out of town for a couple of weeks and need me to look after my niecejanice . i do not want to disappoint janice ! i mean , how could disappoint janice ? by moving away ? why do you keepsaying that ? who ' s moving away ? not me ! so , i ' ll be sure to stay very focused on being a good uncle and guardian . plus , apparently the mayor needs me around to save her all the time . hate to leave that behind . stay tuned next for the sound of folding cardboard and long strips of tape . and to all of thefaceless old women , living secretly or living otherwise : fight the good fight . just ... leave me out of it . ok ? yeah , thesecotton balls are already soaked . and , to everyoneelse : good night , nightmare . good night . today ' s proverb : do not be afraid the dark . be afraid of all of the terrible things that are hidingthere , and the terrible things they will do .
WTNV|Fashion Week|1 June 2015|but do not you see ? you never needed anything else . the weird was within you the whole time . welcome to night vale . hello listeners . later , news , capital no but forget about that . first news , lower case no it ' s fashion week in night vale , that exciting time of year in which we all get to decide what is fashionable and what is not . to use the charming colloquialism , we decide what is ` ` in the sphere '' and what is ` ` spared from the sphere '' . this is night vale ' s hip pest event , and everyone is there , because it is required by law . so everyone is there , and scared , and it is hip as neck . michelle nguyen is the only one who does not look scared . this is her favorite holiday , and she is wearing a vintage summoning cloak and a dog catcher ' s cap , and has two tiny ne on signs attached to her face indicating her eyes . she is the most fashionable person in town , and certain to be spared from the sphere . others are less lucky . town clerk , verona rothschild , is running around saying ` ` oh no , oh no '' , and adjusting her fashionably distressed eyeglasses , casting glances backward at the sphere which is moving implacable to devour the un hip and absorb the outdated . soon she will stumble , and then the sphere will be upon her . it ' s like that popular joke : why did the sister burn her mouth ? because she survived the sphere and was able to eat her pizza before it was cool . and sure enough , michelle nguyen , pizza in hand , is crackling madly watching the chaos and listening intently to headphones that are plugged into nothing at all . the sheriff ' s secret police are seeking any leads or witnesses in the case of the disappearance at the housing development of the shambling orphan . over the last several weeks , at least twelve people have vanished without a trace . except for our memories of their previous existence which , according to a roving gang of pedantic philosophers , who has been interrupting secret police press conferences , does in fact count as a trace . ` ` memories are as real as any of our constructed experiences of the world , '' said one philosopher , without invitation , interrupting important information about the missing persons . ` ` i bet you think reality is a thing , '' he continued , much to the delight of his fellow philosophers , and not a single other person in attendance . the philosophers were last seen high-fiving each other while drinking cheap , but locally made canned beer . the missing persons were last seen at home , and on the street , about town , about their lives , just normally living , until suddenly and unaccountable , they no longer were seen anywhere at all . residents of the shambling orphan and the nearby development , the desert pin es , express mild concern over their strong fears about their abject terror . more on the story as we grasp at narrative threads that can assuage our helplessness in the face of inexplicable tragedy . listeners , last week i had my niece janice over while her parents were taking a romantic long weekend in the kingdom of the der os , deep within the hollow earth . which is of course easily accessed by ordering any item from the arby ' s market fresh menu . yeah , it was really nice to get some time alone with janice . she ' s getting older , you know , and is moving from a child , which is something of an abstract concept , to a person with adult ideas and thoughts and feelings , a human being who you can relate to and with , which is also an abstract concept . we talked , and watched moves . she let me put on cat ballot five times in a row , because that was carlos and i ' s movie night thing and i had been missing that . we ate pop corn . i asked her about any girls or boys she might be interested in , and she diverted me politely but awkwardly to other subjects . i let her . it ' s not for me to pry , that ' s the government ' s job . and if i ' m ever curious , i can look at the public registry of middle school crush es , which is constantly being updated via mind scanning satellite . janice gave me a feeling of family . i rarely feel anymore . eh , it was a good feeling . i hope i will be able to visit janice regularly . in an earlier program , we brought you this week ' s community calendar . however , it appears that there were a few errors in our reporting , so we would like to offer some corrections to our previous calendar . monday we said was free hot chocolate day at the moonlite all-nite din er . in actually , monday will be the day that a great craft crash es down from the heavens , and we all will surround the ominous bulk of it , still glowing hot and smoking from the impact , whispering and wondering , helpless to act . tuesday we said was sign-up day for the night vale adult kickball league in mission grove park . we were right about an event taking place in the park , but it appears that this event will instead be a creature emerging from the craft , towering over us and , in a language we should not understand and yet , and yet we do understand , demanding that we worship it . wednesday we described as being just a nice day to go outside and take a walk . just a really nice day for it , we said . stretch those ga ms , we said . we said the word ` ` ga ms '' over and over , seemingly unable to say anything else . as it turns out , wednesday is actually the day we will stage a brief but ultimately unsuccessful resistance against the horde of slim , many-appendaged alien warriors pouring out from the landing craft . thursday we said would be the day that beings from another world fully defeat us . and we will line the roads and avenues on our knees , heads bowed in recognition of our new masters , our new gods . turns out we were 100 per cent right on that one , so we did not completely get the week schedule wrong . friday we said would be the day that your citizen renewal packets are due , you know , the reams and reams of paperwork probing every personal detail that you have to fill out in order to remain a citizen of night vale . well , it ' s still the day to do that , but instead of turning it in to the city council , who will at that point be locked in a hyperdimensional prison by the occupying extraterrestrials , you will instead turn it in to the supervisor of your assigned human po d , so that they can gauge how much energy can be extracted from your body . saturday we said was saturday . we did not mean anything by this , we just thought it would be funny . people did not find it funny . they wrote and called the station , demanding an explanation . janice rio from down the street seemed especially disturbed . ` ` what do you mean it ' s saturday ? will we be attacked by giant cats ? will the giant cats build huge black cub es all over town ? will i be forced to enter a strange black cub e that will absorb my essence until there ' s nothing left of me ? i am allergic to cats ! '' janice cried . well no , janice , and i ' m sorry for causing a panic . saturday will actually be the day the invading aliens start feeding on us , so do not worry , no cats that day . saturday is just a fun day to say . saturday ! and sunday , well , we were right about sunday , so there you go . just as we said , sunday will be the day that tamika lynn and the beings who claim to be angels team up to lead a dramatic attack against the occupying force with the help of every night vale citizen , driving away our new masters and reinstating our old masters , who are brutal and awful , but who at least are a brutal and awful we know and understand . this has been corrections . or , the community calendar . um , community corrections ? i do not know . this has been what it was . fashion week continues , and the sphere is huge and pulling . everyone is screaming and running and looking just as fashionable as they ever have in their soon-to-be-ended lives . director of emergency press conferences , pamela mitchell , is ostentatiously using decorated cigarette holders of ludicrous length , despite the fact that she does not actually smoke . she ' s not holding them delicately between her first two fingers , but instead gripping hundreds of cigarette holders in her fist , like a quiver of arrows . ` ` see how hip , '' she is saying in a booming voice , levitating quite fashionably three feet off the ground . ` ` see how absolutely of the time i am ! '' the sphere hum s next to her for a moment , and then rolls by , leaving her be . so it seems like this year , holding a quiver of cigarette holders is very ` ` spared from the sphere '' indeed . good survival tip there . old woman josie , speaking from the headquarters of strex operatic limited , said that the new old night vale opera house is complete , and that rehearsal are under full swing for opening night , on june 15 , of a brand new opera written , composed , directed , by and starring legendary screen actor lee margin , who will also form the entirety of the cast and will be selling concessions during intermission . josie said that night vale citizens should expect some of the usual disruption resulting from rehearsal of any kind of live performance . namely , stop and go traffic in a several block radius around the theater , a wake of buzzards curling over the city , and a slight up tick in the number of patients at the emergency room . so it sounds like this opera , whatever opera means and whatever it is , will be a blast ! and now , traffic . a man came and went . he was here before and now is not . how briefly the moment of is before the endless was . he was not a serious man , but then this is not a serious life . we all heard him speak , did we not ? we still do . he is speaking still , even though he is not anything else at all . how comforting the continuation of communication past that point . he was our tour guide through the cosmos , he would say , and then apologize for saying it . he was not a serious man . but then , this is not a serious life . a man came and went . he was here before , and now is not . we miss him . this has been traffic . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home made a public statement that she will not wait any longer . she will destroy mayor dana cardinal once and for all , and claim the mayors hip for herself . in her statement , which was stitched into the inside lining of my jacket this morning , she said : ` ` you want opera ? you want grand performance ? on opening night , you will see a spectacle indeed . a spectacle indeed . '' meanwhile , still no word from hiram mcdaniels , the literal five-headed dragon and the careless old woman ' s previous partner in crime . according to local normal citizen , frank chen , hiram left town weeks ago and wo not be seen around here again . frank ' s other four heads agreed , except the purple head , which had a bag over it and was mumbling , ` ` please do not include me in your foolish schemes ever again ! if it were up to me , things would be very different ! things are different every time it is up to me ! '' the other heads hushed the head with the bag over it and reiterated that they are just a regular guy , like you or me or anyone else who identified as a regular guy , with things like a pick-up and pieces of denis clothing , and enjoyment of certain types of music , and being completely wigless , despite how powerless this must feel . oh , hear that ? listeners , the time has come . the sphere has arrived at the station . it hum s , looming ; it considers , humming ; it loom s , the sphere will decide whether the station and the souls within it are hip enough to be spared . i tell you now that i ... did not prepare for the sphere . it ' s not that i forgot , it is that i do not care , and i ' m not afraid . i do not know . i wear leather parts and a hawaiian shirt and a baseball hat made of honeycomb . i just wore the same thing i slept in last night . if i get ingested by a fashion-conscious sphere for wearing come casual clothes , then that ' ll just be what happened to me . i do not write the story of my life , i only live it . so , while the sphere does whatever it will do next , i take you all - well , all of you hip enough to still remain , to the weather . back from the weather , still here ! the sphere moved on and is now out in the scrublands and sand wastes , deciding which cacti and cottontail rabbits are of the now , and which must be assimilated into the pulsating dark innards of the sphere . of course , radio is always hip ! radio is tireless ! community radio exists outside of time and space and so is the most fashionable thing of all . of course . we all know this . so it ' s good that our station was spared and that i will continue doing radio for the foreseeable future . i ' m not stopping radio broadcast ing . i wo not be doing it here , but i ' ll be continuing to do it . right . so i guess it ' s time then . um , at the start of all this , i promised news , capital no here is the news . my next broadcast as host of night vale community radio - will be my last , in night vale . i am moving to the desert otherworld to spend more time with sweet , talented carlos and the community he has built out there in that vast , sandy alternate dimension . there is a radio station there built by kevin , who.. seems to have himself pretty under control , and his studio only has a little bit of blood , so i should be able to continue doing what i ' m doing just fine . i wo not be doing it in a way that you will be able to hear . but that , too , is just fine . i ' ve missed carlos greatly , and i ' ve also grown weary of a mayor that ca not protect herself , of a town that fears outsiders . of a careless old woman who secretly lives in my home and publicly wants to do me harm . and i think of a desert otherworld where it ' s always sunny , and mountains are real . there is a helpful masked army that can build anything , and your cell phone battery never dies , even if reception is g at best . there is the question : is night vale worth it ? is night vale good ? is it a good town ? well ... i will , for the first time in my long life , live somewhere other than night vale . but , as a poet once said , ` ` no matter where you end up , you ' re still from your home town . '' i ' ll be back to visit from time to time , of course . i need to see janice and my old friend josie , and many others besides . i am not gone , but i am going . i ' m going to live somewhere i can feel good about , somewhere newer and better for me . stay tuned next , eventually , for me reporting on the opening of the opera house , and then not reporting on anything else here , ever again . pen ultimately , good night , night vale . good night . guest post by maisie-whimsie . many thanks to tiikerikani for proofreading .
WTNV|Taking Off|15 June 2015|kevin : we all have to start somewhere . we all have to end somewhere , too , but let ' s concentrate on the other thing . welcome to ... well , hm m . welcome to the desert otherworld . should come up with a better name for this place . names are , after all , extremely important . hi , i ' m your radio host kevin . i ' m speaking to you from our brand new station ! and this is our inaugural broadcast . i ' m so excited to be back on the air ! i ' m not sure we have any listeners yet , but we will . we will ! later in the show , we ' ll be talking to doug and alesha , leaders of the army of masked giants who roam this desert , and who have been instrumental building our new city . they ' ve been so welcoming to us outsiders ! not all outsiders , though . they are , after all , a violent and territorial army . but someoutsiders . people like me and like my friend carlos . he ' s scientist . he ' s a beautiful man who does beautiful things . i havecarlos on the phone with us right now with some breaking news.carlos ! tell everyone about the huge project you ' ve been working on this past year . carlos : hi , kevin ! thanks for having me on the show . so , first off , doug and alesha are here in my kitchen . alesha built refrigerator from some cactus pads , twine , and three different kinds of birds , and now they ' re making a bunch of pa sta salad for lunch this week ! they'llsave some for you if you d like . kevin : how delightful ! i ' m ... totally disgusted by pa sta salad . ca not stand the taste or the smell . in fact , to look at it causes me to heave.but thank you , that ' s so kind ! carlos : ... right . so , this new experiment – and i have to tell you , i am reallyexcited about it . you know how our cell phone always work in thisdesert otherworld , even though there are no towers , and how whenever seem to run out of battery ? kevin : yes ! i love takingthese facts for granted ! carlos : well , i ' m on the verge of un covering what ' s causing that . here in laboratory , which doug and alesha and one of the other soldiers whosename is built for me , i ' ve been hard at work pacing about in front of a roof conical flasks , beakers , and tubes , furiouslywriting greek letters and arabic numbers and i think , later today , i will make an enormous breakthrough . kevin : what did you find out ? carlos : i ca not say yet . i ' m just waiting on my computer to finishcalculating the – kevin : ... everything okay ? carlos : i do not know . alesha and doug look really agitated . they ' re jumping and down by the window . the other giant soldiers are running information outside . i need to see what ' s wrong . kevin : while carlos checks on our favorite soldiers , let ' s get an update noon the roller coster inhabitants ! i'mreferring to the roller coster doug and alesha built for our newtown months ago . it looks terribly fun ! it has a tall first hill , an da 90 º drop off that is almost 600 feet , i ' m told , and then , it goesinto a series of loops and turns and figure 8s and thensome spiral , where the riders go upside down several times ! per second ! and then , there ' s a sheet of flames that , as you approach , it looks like you ' re about to go right through the fire , but at the lastsecond , the track spiral again and you go through the fire upsidedown ! oh h ! anyway , it ' s an exciting-looking ride . i have not been on it yet.that ' s because after they started it on its first trip , they haven'tbeen able to stop it . they did not invent brakes , so ... that ' s an issue ! and even though they cut the power to the ride , it ' s still going , with the same passengers , caught in an interminable cycle of fun ! oh h ! we have carlos back on the line again ! carlos ? carlos : doug and alesha are gone . it turns out that the commotion was overanother army marching along the horizon . doug and alesha ran screaming around the house and through the kitchen , overturning my cutting board andgrabbing their weapons . alesha took my chef ' s knife , and doug made amakeshift slughorn out of one of my large funnels so that he couldcall their army to action . kevin : good for them , protecting our community ! carlos : no , but ... i– i– i was trying to explain that the other army was marching perpendicular us , they were not marching towards . this desert is filled with small armies , always marching indifferent directions . we – we ca not attack them all for no reason ! and now my kitchen counter is demolished . kevin : oh , it ' ll grow back . so ? i ' m so excited to learn more about your research into the strangeproperties of this region . i think you once called this desertotherworld ` ` the most scientific ally interesting community in thus . '' carlos : well ... no , my exact words were kevin : so ... when do you expect the results ? sounds like whatever you come with could possibly be a monument al shift in how we perceivethermodynamic laws . carlos : well , i ' m at my lab right now , hunched over my computer , waiting fort to complete its final report , then comparing its results to thousands of hand-written notes from the past year . i believe i canpinpoint the exact source of this desert ' s energy . it should not belong . please do not rush me . kevin : great ! let us know soon , though ! whilecarlos does that , perhaps i can tell you all a little bit about our new radio station . take you on an audit tour , if you will . we have a tall broadcast tower made of stones and adore . those zig-zaggyelectrical bolts visibly shooting outward from the top of the tower ? those are actual radio waves ! inside the building itself , we have a small broadcast booth with a couple of new miss . some of the members of the masked army of giants helped decorate my studio , too ! it was so empty and bloodless before . required a lot of wizards and rodent , but ... it ' s finally starting to feel like home ! i'vegot a producer ' s booth just off to my right . i can see my old internvanessa in there , hi vinesse ! ! we ' re a bit understaffed , so vanessahas been having to act as my producer as well as head of sales and marketing , and even answering phone ! good thing she has adoppelgänger to help out . most people kill their double , but ... that ' s such a waste of a good opportunity ! the more the merrier , the more productive , i say ! oh ! and we ' re hiring right now ! if you have experience in any of the following areas : ad sales , graphics design , office management , entomology , fort ran programming , balcony , or sports law , please sendyour resume to radio station , care of kevin . we have no postal service in the desert otherworld , nor any mailboxes , so it ' s important that you carefully reread the secret by rhode borne in order to wishyour resume into my office . soundslike carlos is back on the line now ! did you get the results fromyour ... carlos : doug and alesha are back . kevin : oh , good ! so wonderful to have dear friends around to be a part of your brilliant achievement . carlos : yeah , but they ' re in no condition to celebrate the great strides scientific study right now . most of the army returned from fighting , but there are more than a dozen who did not . alesha lost two fingers , and doug is bleeding quite badly because of a compound fracture in his forearm . everyone who returned is in readable condition . believe they ' ll be fine . but they ' re wounded , and need lots of rest . and no more fighting for a long time ! it ' s a mess overhere . kevin : good thing they have such a good and helpful friend in you . so , tell us about your study on the strange energy here in the desert . carlos : ugh . i– i c– i ca not yet . the army came in so quickly , droppingtheir weapons everywhere , along with some detached limbs that i don'teven think belong to them , and all of my journals , which i had left out and open on my desk , have been rendered unable . there are broken beakers andblood-soaked composition notebook everywhere . i do not even nowhere to begin cleaning up all of this blood ! kevin , faintly : ohhh.ohhh ! carlos : i ' m sorry , did you just say something ? kevin : nnnnnnnnnno ? i ... just ... like your story . carry on . carlos : doug ? doug ? come back ! kevin , i have to go.doug just constructed a makeshift splint out of rocks and snakes . he just grabbed his axe and ran out the back door . ugh.and there goes alesha . stop going to war ! you need rest ! call you back , kevin.they ca not go on like this . kevin : oh , listeners , i ' m getting word of strong winds out of the east , stirring up dust devils and hurling plant debris and weak-willedanimals through the air . this is a rare unless day for ourotherworld desert . whilecarlos tries to get his notes un-bloodied , let ' s have a closer look at the weather . kevin : wo w ! that weather report was information ! i had no idea how dangerous storm that was until i heard that report . to be a radio broadcast who gets to tell stories about things that make us unhappy thrill me to my bones ! because by telling people about all that can make us unhappy , i prepare them to truly enjoy thosehappy moments when they come . once , my hometown of desert bluff had a deadly outbreak of throat spiders.hundreds were diagnosed with this usually-treatable disease , but twas a particularly virulent strain , and many people died , or wereleft without voices and lower jaws when it was all over . almost a day would not go by where you did not hear a fit of strenuous coughing , punctured by a muffled *pop*only to turn around and see a cascade of tiny spiders pouring overt he craggy ledge that used to be a person ' s lower teeth . each day i got to report these upsetting stories , but the bestpart about it was when desert bluff residents eventually stoppedlosing part of their faces to throat spiders , and we all rejoiced incur newly-healthy and happy lives . as the saying goes , ` ` it ' s always dawn . '' oh ! and speaking of sunshine , carlos just arrived here , live in the studio with me ! carlos ? did you go out in this weather ? you'recovered in dust , and those look like friction burns in the shape of lab goggles on your face . are you okay ? did doug and alesha make it back ? carlos : not yet . they ... what is this all over your studio ? is that barbecue sauce ? kevin : oh , that ? that ' s just blood ! and some old bones , and loose teeth , andbeaks and things . i finally decorated , thanks for noticing ! and just notice you have a piece of paper in your hand ! that must be yourfinal report ! look at how we both notice things about each other ! love that ! carlos : i ... i , um ... kevin : well , you sound sad . which is great news , because it means you ' ll be happy again eventually ! it ' s a tough day , what with all the weather and the wars and the blood . but you ' re boyfriend will soon be movingfrom night vale to come live here with you ! carlos : well , um ... about that ... kevin : and ? and ? you finallyhave the scientific results of your hard scientific work ! carlos : i do not . i do not have results , kevin ! when the army marched out again went back to trying to recover my notes . i had just gotten the labdesktops clean when alesha ' s large dog bounded through the lab and out the front door , sending every glass tube and jar crashing intothe floor . when i bent over to see the damage , i saw my computerthere too , just on the ti les , snapped nearly in half , a tuft of whiter covering the keyboard , singed slightly by the smoke streaming out of the broken monitor . i lost it all , kevin . my entire year of study is gone . kevin : what ' s the paper , then ? did you at least learn some of your results ? carlos : this is nothing . it ' s , um , just a letter i wrote to , uh ... a friend . kevin : oh ? i love letters ! letters are so fun to receive ! carlos : mmm , not this one . it ' s a sad letter . a letter about regrets , aboutmistakes . you know how sometimes you spend a lot of time with someone , and you think that the someone makes you happy , but then suddenly one day you realize ... maybe you were not happy at all . maybe both would be better off doing what you love in different places . without each other.maybe neither of you were as happy as either of you thought . kevin : that is a sad-sounding letter . i do not understand or like that at all . carlos : i have spent the last year all wrong . kevin : i believe in you , carlos ! do not let destruction , blood , and war hold you back ! you ' re a brilliant scientist ! carlos : i realize i need to just start everything over , dedicate myself . ineed to do it right this time . no more distractions . i ca not spendanother year like this one . so ... it pains me to carry this letter , but ... i wrote it to set my boundaries . kevin : so you know , there ' s no postal service here yet . carlos : i know . um , that ' s why i ' m hand-delivering it . kevin : oh . remember , no one should ever be sad . choose not to be sad , carlos . in fact , choose to be happy ! perhaps your letter is the firststep to choosing happiness , even while it makes someone else sad . carlos : i understand . listen , um , i should go . i ' m headed to night vale one final time . i need to talk to cecil about ... well , about some changes.thanks for everything , kevin . you ' ve been so kind to me in thisdifficult year . kevin : goodby , carlos ! well , it ' s a shame that our huge scientific breakthrough did not quitehappen today . as the old phrase goes , ` ` the best-laid plans of mice and men are completely different kinds of plans altogether . verydifferent creatures , those two . '' butt ' s not a total wash our next show should feature spine-tinglingadventure stories about today ' s desert battles ! we have so much to do , us . so much explore and understand . so much to make here in our great desertotherworld . say , we really do need a name for this place . things without names don'treally exist . so i ' m going to call this ... well , i ' m going to call desert bluff ! desert bluff was the name of my hometown , and by naming it desert bluff , this place becomes my newhometown ! we are in my home ! ! we are in desert bluff , no matterwhere we are in space or time . what is a town but a name , right ? untilnext time , new desert – oh . it looks like carlos left behind thatletter he was supposed to hand deliver . i d better not read it . nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno.better not . untilnext time , new desert bluff . until next time . oh . oh no ! this is so sad ! no . id o not like this . i am sad . today ' s proverb : a rose by any othername is called something else .
WTNV|Review|15 June 2015|you love something , set it free . fit does not come back , it probably died of sadness because it thought you loved it . welcome to night vale . it'sdifficult to say goodby to your hometown . difficult indeed . we'llget to all of that soon , but first we bring you the item of , i'msure , most interest to all of you : a review of last night ' s operate inaugural performance of the new old night vale opera house , atribute to the building which once stood proudly in this town for decades before succumbing , 20 years ago , to an checked puppyinfestation . the new old opera house is luxurious and stylish . i had no idea whatopera was until last night , so my expectations for the building werepretty low . i mean , i do not know what you think opera is ; i was expecting something like fenced-in yardsoccupied full of filthy straw , occupied by hundreds of heavilydrugged wolves . but it turns out that opera houses look nothing like petting zoos . displace had a chandelier , and velvet seats , and lush red curtains , an da snack bar , and people wearing just the fancies clothes you could imagine . tuxedos , and ball gowns , and balaclavas , and shin guards . old woman josie and all of her tall winged friends who go by the nameerika and who claim to be angels , were there . they were the driving force behind rebuilding of the new old opera house . it was only fitting , then , thatbefore the performance , josie gave a toast from the stage . shetoasted opera , and night vale , and all of the donors who made the opera house possible . finally , she toast ed old friends . and when she did , she looked at me and grinned . blushed , and looked down at my shoes – which were wasteful spongeclogs that matched my tights perfectly . ok , so , i ' m sure you ' re asking the same question i ' ve been asking for years : what even opera ? i do not have any training in opera , but i ' ll do my best describe it . basically , opera is kind of like theater , but they don'traise the curtain all the way up . so you only can see feet shufflingabout while you hear high pitched wailing and combustion engines . thisparticular opera was called ` ` amara . '' it was composed and conducted and mostlyperformed by acting legend lee margin . it was about a young girl who goes on some kind of ... adventure ? it was not clear , because opera issuper-interactive and entirely non linear . sometimes people from the audience throw old fruit at the stage , and then the actors jump intothe audience to wrestle these people . audience members are encouraged yell out things they think the performer should do , andperformers often localise their dis taste for the audience . at one point in the first act i shouted , ` ` sing a song about old love and new horizons , about wanderlust and uncertainty ! '' and then a member of the chorus spat at me . and moments later i found someonehandcuffed me to my arrest . it was super fun ! they did raise the curtain all the way once , revealing a detailed set of astorm-tossed ocean , upon which a great ship lurched skyward at op curling monstrous wave . the details of the painting and the carpentrywere lawless . i ' ve never been in such awe of a stage set as i was then . but i think the stage manager recognized the error in allowing the audience to see this , and quickly lowered the curtain to just couple of feet off the floor . id id not recognize most of the performer because they kept the curtains low , and the stage lights so dim , but i did note that frank chenwas in the cast , looking every inch the normal human with – i canon ly assume – a normal number of heads . at the start of the second act , i sens ed a flurry motion in my periphery . felt a cold touch on my chained hand . ` ` nicehandcuffs , '' a whisper said . ` ` looks like you wo not be able to saviour friend dana tonight . '' i was terrified , yes , but like everyone i ' m usuallyterrified . i also felt rage . rage at the careless old womanwhispering behind me . had she handcuffed me so that i could not save my former inter , my former friend , my current mayor , dana cardinalfrom whatever evil deeds were coming her way ? looked up at mayor cardinal in her log e box . she was staring straight at the stage , focused and stony . and despite all my anger at my old friend – that she had presumably bought me at a sheriff ' s secretpolice auction last year , and had been using me for the last severalmonths against my will to protect herself against the five-headeddragon hiram mcdaniels and the careless old woman – despite all that , i looked at dana ' s face , hoping she would see me pleading for her safety . i want to trust and love my friend , and for that moment , i did . and i was sorry that the careless old woman had restrained me so that i could not help her ... even if , this time , i had wanted to . followed the mayor ' s gaze toward the stage . the house lights dimmed , and the curtain split open . i saw normal human frank chen centerstage , each of his heads puffing and snarl ing , preparing for filaria . as an aside , i am told this was to be opera ' s first-ever quite area , but honestly , i do not know what either of those words even mean . actually , only four of frank'sheads were snarl ing : the gold , green , gray , and blue ones . but his purple head was looking right at me . and i felt something familiar , but ... at the same time , something that i did not understand . my handstrained against its chain , but there was nothing i could do . as the orchestra – led by and comprise entirely of lee margin and a slidewhistle – swelled , and frank chen continued to bench fire and hiss , we all knew something was wrong . i mean , it ' s possible that an ariais just a bunch of roars and flames – i ' m no expert – but it did not seem likely . frank chen then tore off his bow tie , and undoing so revealed he was not five foot , eight inch middle-aged humanfrank chen at all , but hiram mcdaniels , an 18 foot tall five-headed dragon ! hiramleapt into the air above the orchestra seats . i heard a muffledscream from above . i looked to the mezzanine and saw trish hide , deputy assistant to mayor cardinal , trying to quickly escort the mayor away ... but it was too late . i caught a brief glimpse of someone had never seen before . or , had never seen in my waking life . shew as standing just behind trish and mayor cardinal . it was a woman had once seen in a dream . in my dream she had been underwater , amongcoral , young and whispering and careless . and now , in thisworld , that is very likely not just a dream , i saw this same woman . she was old , and shouting , andfaceless . hiramflew up , past the chandelier , toward dana in the mezzanine , all of his heads focused on their target , teeth bared and angry ... except the purple head , which was twisted away , as though trying – with just its neck – to deflect the course of its body . at that moment , i felt myself rising against my will . there i was , lot number 37 , being pulled into use once more . i looked up at dana , but she was not looking back at me at all . she was preparing to defendherself , alone . another everything went black . i saw nothing . felt nothing . i was nowhere . heard a voice . it was ... shiny , and panicked . it told me it was sorry keep using me , that it had bought me at an auction two years backjust in case . ` ` younger know what could happen . nothing can be trusted . '' the voice told me it especially did not trust the other heads it shares body with , who are always scheming , always making new plans.plus , it was tired of having to commit violent crimes , and consistently living life on the run . the voice just wanted to settle down . maybe start a family . ` ` nightmare ' s such a nice town , do not you think ? '' the voice asked me . and asked , ` ` hiram ? is that you ? '' and the voice said , ` ` not all of hiram . most people call me purple head , but i prefer violet . '' ` ` rhyme ? '' i asked . violetsaid , ` ` one head could not work against four . i ' ve known that a longtime . i needed another body . lot 37 was put up for sale , and the other heads were distracted by lot 38 ( a normal human disguise ) , so bought you . '' now , i was furious , of course . i told violet that i thought dana had bending this the whole time . i blamed her over and over ! ` ` i have lost a friend because of you , violet , '' i said , ` ` and do you have any idea what it ' s like , to have you control me in this way ? '' ` ` yes , '' violet said . ` ` i only have one-fifth control over my own body . thesis my life all of the time , carried along against my will by the foolish plans of those closest to me , betrayed by my own limbs , by the beating of my own heart . but ... i am sorry . i really am . '' ` ` you need to fight your own fights , '' i said . ` ` will , cecil , '' violet said . ` ` i am giving you back lot 37. transfer ownership back to you . you are yours once again . and whatever else happens tonight , i ' m sorry . '' ` ` well , you should be , '' i said . ` ` but , '' violet said , ` ` do not blame me for losing your friendship with dana.you were the one who did not trust her . that was you , and only you . '' then his voice was gone . i woke on the floor of the opera house , which was dark and empty . i was still handcuffed to a scorched arrest that had been completelyburned off of the chair itself . most seats and wall sconces had beenheavily scorched and destroyed . i was not sure if it was hiram who did that , or ... maybe that ' s just the standard aftermath of opera . walked outside to the curb , watching the rain in the streetlights . isa w the drops flickering in a puddle below . i do not like reflections that flicked . thought of my mother for the first time in a long time . missed errand , same word , different meaning , i missed the opera . and the afterparty , too . and , same word , bothmeanings : i miss my friend dana . i wish i could have ... saved her . shew as gone , and i failed her . no one was around to help with the weight of my guilt , or to un chain me from the arrest . a hugestorm was coming through . a rare weather event for the desert . let'shave a report on that night ' s weather now . the storm passed and i began my walk home – my clothes soaked , my clogsnow several sizes larger . the streets were quiet . and i took it allen , knowing these were my final days in night vale , certain i had made the right decision . then smelled the sandy earth , wet from the storm , and saw the buildings what would soon no longer be my town washed clean by the driven rain , and i wavered in my certainty . lost in thought , i failed to hear the car tires on the slick concrete , or see the head lights swinging my shadow across the sidewalk . i heard , '' cecil , get in ! '' and , like any citizen of night vale when ordered get into an ominous unmarred car , i obeyed without thinking . inside the black stretch li mo , impossible large inside , were dozens of operasupporters and local celebrities . old woman josie and her tall wingedfriends named erika were there . waiters passed around hors d'oeuvresand champagne . i had not missed the after party after all . my sister abby and her husband steve and my niece janice were there . janicethrew her arms around my waist and said , ` ` uncle cecil , i love the opera so much , thanks for the tickets ! i love the part where the dragon flew out over the audience like whose ! and then it started fighting itself , and the purple head startingbiting the other heads , and it was really funny ! then , it flew away , out of the theater , and there was a lot of fire , and i thought i sa wan old lady with no face ran out too , and – and the mayor was saved , and mr . lee margin sang a beautiful song about all the animals we can see using mirrors , and then it was over ! and everyone cheered ! andover is so cool ! mosaic you were moving away . why are you moving away , uncle cecil ? uncle carlos says you do not have to move if you do not want to ! willow still come to my birthday party ? '' janicecontinued chattering , but ... i was dizzy at the name she had justsaid . i interrupted her . ` ` carlos ? janice , did you say carlos ? '' ` ` du h ! he ' s right over there , uncle cecil ! '' she said . turned , and i saw him . and he was already looking at me . and started to say , ` ` ... '' and restarted to say , ` ` ... '' another we just hugged . so tightly . and in my ear , carlos said , ` ` sorry i missed the opera . i had to let kevinknow i was returning home , and staying there .

'' fromacross the impossible large car , dana winked and finally smiled . mouthed , ` ` i ' m sorry , '' and she did not respond , but , still winking a slow strange wink , she receded into the crowd like a distant walker into mist . at thee nd of the night , the car dropped carlos and me back home and ... id o not think we slept the whole night ! talking about our new old lifetogether , all these memories and plans ! we are back together in outcome , and i am back with you in my studio . final show as host of night vale community radio was to be a review of an opera . and that ' s still true ... someday . but it wo not be thisopera . carlosand i are staying in night vale for now . i will be back on the air with you again very soon with more news , and more stories ... with moreover . think carlos is right . night vale is not a single unified thingthat can love , or be loved . it ' s just the name , slapped onto a set borders and rules that some old bureaucrats wearing soft meat crownsdevised centuries ago . but they do not live here anymore ! wed ! id o . and i can make it worth it . i ca not just leave it , i have to live it ! live it , and make it better ! for myself , for carlos ! for friends . for abby , and steve , and janice , for old woman josie and all of the elias . for dana . and for you , listeners . we will , together , celebrate another homecoming game . we will , together , survive another street cleaning . we will , together ... well , we will see . i ca not promise i ' ll neverleave you . no one can promise that . but until that moment , let ' s keepworking on this town , this collective idea , this night vale . whatever want that name to mean , we can always start over if we have to.rededicate ourselves . do it right . start with , the secret police have , once again , jailed hirammcdaniels for his numerous crimes against his fellow citizens.although , in recognition of the violet head ' s valiant struggleagainst the other heads and his own contested body , they ' ve put small hole in the wall that violet can stick through and be outside of the jail walls , since technically he is not under arrest . staytuned next for happenstance reconstructed into narrative , and falselyinterpreted as having significance . and always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : you say potato , is ay potato . potato . potato . potato . potato . potato . yes , this is verygood . let ' s keep going . potato . potato . potato .
WTNV|The Retirement of Pamela Winchell|15 August 2014|cecil : in response to the ` ` murderer on the loose '' situation , mayor danacardinal has sent her official night vale director of emergency press conferences to issue an emergency press conference . unfortunately , the press conference gazed is currently on fire ... due to routine maintenance . so this press conference will be held right here in our studio . please welcome former mayor pamela mitchell . pamela mitchell : hello , members of the press corps . hello , people of the public.hello , visiting dignitaries , wandering spirits , and hidden royalty disguised as local farmers due to troubles in their home country . would like to start this emergency press conference with a joke . ok.so . what did the dog say to the bar tender ? crowd : what ? pamela : '' death is just a tone of soil – but then , my friend , so is life ! '' hold any laughter for the end of the presentation , please ! citizens , there is a murderer among us , striking at us from the shadows ! yeah , so what ? this morning , my wrist was sore ! i do not know why ! i woke , and it was sore ! does anyone know why ? if you know why , please notify a town official . i think it ' s probably a joint thing . maybe you ' ll all make it through today . maybe you wo not . i mean , what am i , some kind of expert on you ? i ' m not . i don'tthink . well , i might be.you know , it has bee na long time since college , and i do not remember what it was that studied . i mean ... plants ? are plants a thing ? cecil : pure fiction . pamela : ok , not that then . it is important , in times of emergency , to remain calm . this wo not keep you safe . whatever was going to happen to you , will happen to you anyway.but you will be less irritating to those around you as it happens . mean , people usually make such a fuss and a bunch of noise when immortal danger , and some of us are trying to read right now , thank you ! maybe the reading is why my wrist is sore ! ah ! i – i – i should have stretched more before doing something that takes this much hard physical labor . mayor cardinal asked me to come to speak to you . i have come to tentativelyrespect mayor cardinal , although i maintain a slight suspicion that she may be a number of super-sentient wizards in a meat costume . have the same suspicion toward all people , including myself . anyway , mayor cardinal asked me to relay some important emergency into to all of you , so here it is : on hedge of the known universe is a campfire , and around it are three figures , indistinct and muddling – refugees from the universe before our own . they will never be able to return home . and , metaphorically , neither will any of us . we are all , metaphorically , huddled around a campfire at the edge of the known universe . but literal terms , only those three figures are . and no one knows their names . and no one ever will . the night vale municipal government hopes that this emergency information was helpful to you . as always , if you are in need of assistance , please do not bother me . thank you , cecil , i will now step into the circle i drew in the sand with my big toe and vanish in a flash green smoke . cecil : oh . well , thank you very much ! annnnnnnndyup ! there she goes , flash of green smoke . looks like she still has little bit of that mayor al power left inside her . today ' s proverb : dodge ram . good car . even better advice .
WTNV|Through the Narrow Place|01 October 2015|the history of the town of night vale is long and complicated , reaching back thousands of years to the earliest indigenous people in the desert . we will cover none of it here . suffice it to say that it is a town like many towns – with a city hall , and a bowl ing alley ( the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex ) , and a din er ( the moonlite all-nite din er ) , and a supermarket ( ralph ' s ) . and , of course , a community radio station , reporting all the news that we are allowed to hear . on all sides , it is surrounded by empty desert flatness . it is muchlike your town , perhaps . it might be more like your town than you'dlike to admit . it is a friendly desert community , where the sun is hot , the moon beautiful , and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep . welcome to night vale . one pawn shops in night vale work like this : first , you need an item to pawn . to get this , you need a lot of time behind you . years spentliving and existing , until you ' ve reached a point where you believethat you exist , and that a physical item exists , and that the concept of ownership exists . and that , improbable as all those are , theseabsurd beliefs line up in a way that result in you owning an item . good job ! nicely done ! second , once you believe you own an item , you must reach a pointwhere you need money more than you need the item . this is the easieststep – just own an item , and own a body with needs , and wait . the only pawn shop in the town of night vale is run by the very youngjackie pierre . it has no name , but if you need it , you will nowhere it is . this knowledge will come suddenly , often while you ar ein the shower . you will collapse , surrounded by a bright glowingblackness , and you will find yourself on your hands and knees , thwart water running over you , and you will know where the pawn shops . you will smell must , and soap , and feel a stab of panic about how alone you are . it will be like most shower you ' ve taken . before you can offer jackie your item , there will first be some handwashing , which is why there are bowls of purified water throughout the shop . you need to chant a little as you wash your hands . you , of course , should always chant when you wash your hands . it is only hygienic . when you have been properly purified , you will lay the item on the counter , and jackie will consider it . jackie will have her feet up on the counter . she will lean back . ` ` eleven dollars , '' she will say . she will always say ` ` elevendollars . '' you will not respond . you are , ultimately , unnecessary to thisprocess . you are , ultimately , unnecessary . ` ` no , no , '' she will say , waving her hand . and then she will name her actual price . usually it is money . sometimes it is other things.sometimes it is dreams , experiences , visions . then you will die – but only for a little while . the item will be given a price tag , $ 11 . everything in the pawn shops that price , no matter what she loan ed you for it . once you are no longer dead , she will give you a ticket , which later you will be able to exchange for the item . or , at any time , you may look at the ticket and remember the item . remembering the item is free . you are leaving this story now . you were only example . and it is probably safer for you not to be in history anyway . jackie pierre squinted out the window at the parking lot . there wasn one coming . she was closing soon . relatively speaking , she was always closing soon , and also always just opening . beyond the window was the parking lot , and beyond that the desert , and beyond that the sky ( mostly void , partially stars ) . layer ed from her vantage , it was all distance , equally unteachable from her postal the counter . she had recently turned 19. she had been recently-19 for as long as she could remember . the pawn shop had been hers for a long time.centuries , maybe . clocks and calendars do not work in night vale . timeitself does not work . for all her years as the newly-19 owner of the pawn shop , she left the shop only when it was closed , and then only to her apartment , where she sat with her feet up on the coffee table , taking in the community radio and the local cable news . based on what the news told her , the outside world seemed a dangerous place . there was alwayssome world-ending cataclysm threatening night vale . fera dogs , sentiment glowing cloud with the ability to control minds ( although the glow cloud had become less threatening since its election to thecal school board ) , old oak doors that led to a strange desertotherworld , where the current mayor had been t rapped for months ... it seemed safer to not have friends or hobbies . just sit at work , headdown , doing her job , and then sit at home , glass after glass of orange juice , radio on , safe from anything that might disrupt her routine . her days were spent in silence . mostly void , partially thought . someday she would re-catalog her inventory . other days she would cleanse shelves . every day she would sit and think . she would try to think about the day she took over the store . there must havebeen a day like that , but she could not think of the specific . she had been doing this for decades . she was very young . both of thesewere true at the same time . she knew college was a thing 19 year old s did . she knew beingunemployed in a difficult job market and living at home was a thingother 19 year old s did . she was content doing neither of those , so she continued on and on and on at the pawn shop . she understood the world and her place in it . she understood nothing.the world and her place in it were nothing , and she understoodthat . because of the lack of working time in night vale , she went off her gut feeling about when the shop should close . when the feeling came , it came , and the doors had to be locked , removed from their frames , and safely hidden . the feeling came . she swung her feet off the counter . a decent day . old woman josie , who lived out by the car lot , had come in with great number of cheap plastic flaming . she had carried them in large canvas sack , and emptied them onto the counter like loosechange . ` ` it is not for myself that i give up these little ones , '' said old woman josie , addressing a bare wall several feet to the right ofjackie in a strong , formal voice , making the occasional sweepinggesture with her palm , ` ` but for the future . '' josie stopped , her palm still out . jackie decided the speech was over . ` ` all right , man . i ' ll give you ... eleven dollars , '' she said . old woman josie tightened her eyes at the bare wall . ` ` oookaayyy ... '' jackie softened , plodding at one of the flamingosand looking at its weak plastic belly . ` ` tell you what . i ' ll give you a good night ' s sleep . '' old woman josie shrugged . ` ` i ' ll take it . '' a good night ' s sleep was a wildly generous offer . the flaming wereworthless , but there were so many of them , and jackie couldn'thelp herself . she never refused an item . ` ` be careful not to touch those directly , '' josie said , after shew as finished being dead . using shop rags , jackie laid the flaming out , side by side , on shelf , each one tagged with a single handwritten $ 11 price tag . ` ` most things should not be touched anyway , '' jackie thought . ` ` goodby , dear , '' said josie , taking the ticket that jackie had filled out . ` ` come by sometime and talk to the angels . they ' ve beenasking about you . '' the angels lived with old woman josie in her small tract home , whosetract no longer stood , leaving it alone at the edge of town . the angels did ch ores for her , and josie made a modest income sellingitems they had touched . no one understood why the angels lived with her . very little was understood about the angels ; some things were . of course , angels do not exist . it is illegal to considertheir existence , or even to give them a dollar when they forget bus money and start covering around the ralph ' s asking for change . the great hierarchy of angels is a foolish dream , and anyway forbidden knowledge to night vale citizens . all of the angels insight vale lived with josie out by the car lot . there are no angels in night vale . around the middle of the day , jackie had acquired a car . it was amercedes , only a few years old , and offered with urgency by a young man wearing a gray unstriped business suit stained with dirt . it was impressive how he got the car onto the counter , but there is a way these things are done , and it had to go on the counter . he washed his hands , and chant ed . the water went brown and red . she settled on an offer of five dollars , talking him down fromeleven , and he laughed as he took the money and the ticket . ` ` hata it ' s not funny at all , '' he explained , laughing . and , finally , a woman named diane clayton arrived late in the afternoon – almost closing time , according to jackie ' s gut . ` ` can i help you ? '' jackie asked . she was un sure why she askedthis , as jackie rarely greeted people who came in the store . jackie knew who diane was . she organized pta fundraisers . dianesometimes came by to distribute flies that said things like ` ` nightmare high school pta fund drive ! help give kid s themunicipally-approved education they deserve ! your support mandatory , and appreciated ! '' diane , in jackie ' s mind , looked just like a woman who would be inactive pta mo m , with her kind face and comfortable clothing . she alsothought diane looked like a woman who would be a loan officer , with her conservative make up choice and serious demeanour . she wouldlook like a pharmacist , if she were to ever wear the standard whitecoat , gas mask , and hip waters . she looked like a lot of things to jackie . mostly , she looked like person lost in both a place and a moment . diane took a handkerchief from her purse . without changing her upwarddistant expression , she wept a single tear onto the cloth . ` ` godlike to offer this , '' she said , finally looking at jackie . jackie considered the handkerchief . the tear would dry soon . ` ` elevendollars . that ' s the deal , '' she said . ` ` i ' ll take it , '' diane said . her loose-hanging arms were now drawn up near her purse . jackie took the tear-dabbed handkerchief and gave diane her ticket and the money . after her brief death , diane thanked her and hurried out of the shop . jackie tagged the tear with it ' s $ 11 price tag and placed it on shelf . so , a decent day . jackie flipped the sign on the door to closed , her hand touching the window , leaving its ghost upon the glass . a hand raised to say '' stop , '' or ` ` come here , '' or ` ` hello ! '' or ` ` help ! '' or , maybe , only ` ` i am here . this hand , at least , is real . '' she looked down to adjust the items on the counter , and when she looked up , the man was there . he was wearing a ta n jacket , and holding a bearskin suitcase . he had normal human features . he had arms and legs . he might have had hair , or maybe was wearing a hat ? everything was normal . ` ` hello , '' he said . ` ` my name is everett . '' jackie screamed . the man was perfectly normal . she screamed . ` ` i ' m sorry , '' he said . ` ` are you closed ? '' ` ` no , that ' s okay . no . can i help you ? '' ` ` yes , i hope so , '' he said . there was buzzing coming from somewhere . his mouth ? ` ` i have an item i would very much like to pawn . '' ` ` i ... '' she said , and waved her hand to indicate everything height have said next . he nodded at her hand . ` ` thank you for your help . have i introducedmyself ? '' ` ` no . '' ` ` ah . i apologize . my name is emmett . '' they shook hands . her hand continued to shake after he let go . ` ` yes , well , '' he said , ` ` here is the item . '' he set a small slip of paper on the counter . on it , written in dullsmeared pencil , were the words : king city the handwriting was shaky , and the pencil had been pressed down hard . she could not stop staring at it , although she did not know what about was interesting . ` ` interesting , '' she said . ` ` no , not very , '' said the man in the ta n jacket . the man washed his hands and quietly chant ed , and jackie forced herself to lean back and put her feet on the counter . there is a way these things are done . she looked a few times at the man ' s face , but she found she forgot it the moment she stopped looking . ` ` eleven dollars , '' she said . the man hummed , and other small voices joined him – apparently fromwithin the bearskin suitcase . ` ` where did this come from ? '' she asked . ` ` why are you offering it to me ? what would i do with it '' her voice was high and cracked . it did not sound like her at all . the man was now harmonizing with the voices from his suitcase . he did not seem to register her questions . ` ` no , no , i ' m sorry , '' she said , fully aware of but unable to stoper poor negotiating technique . ` ` my mistake . thirty dollars , and an idea about time . '' ` ` done , '' he said , smiling . was that a smile ? she gave him the $ 30 and told him her idea about time . ` ` that is very interesting ! '' he said . ` ` i ' ve never thought of that way . generally , i do not think at all . '' then he died . she usually used this time to finish up the paperwork , get the ticketready . she did nothing . she clutched the slip of paper in her hand . he was not dead anymore . ` ` i ' m sorry , your ticket . '' ` ` there ' s no need , '' he said , still possibly smiling . should not get a good enough look at his face to tell . ` ` no , your ticket ! there is a way these things are done . '' she scrawled out a ticket with the information tickets always had : random number ( 12,739 ) , the quality of light at the time transaction ( fine ) , the general feeling of the weather outside ( looming ) , her current thoughts on the future ( looming , but fine ) , and a quick sketch of what she thought hearts should looklike , instead of the pulling lumps of straw and clay that grow , cancer-like , into our chests when we turn nine years old . he took the ticket as she thrust it at him , and then , thanking her , turned to leave . ` ` goodby ! '' she said . ` ` king city , '' said the paper . goodby , waved the man , saying nothing . ` ` wait ! '' she said , ` ` you never told me your name ! '' ` ` oh , you ' re right , '' he said , hand on door . ` ` my name is elliott.a pleasure to make your acquaintance . '' the door swung open , and shut . jackie held the slip of paper in her hand , un sure for the first time in however long her life had beenwhat to do next . she felt that her routine , unbroken for decades , had been disrupted , that something had gone differently . but she also hadn idea why she felt that . it was just a slip of paper , just clutched her hand . just that . she finished her paperwork . on the line that said pawn ed by , she stopped . she could not remember his name . she could not evenremember his face . she looked down at the piece of paper . king city she looked up to get a glimpse of him out the window , just to jostle her stuck memory . from the counter , she could see the man in the tanjacket outside . he was running out to the desert . she could justbarely see him at the edge of the parking lot ' s radius of light . harms were swinging wildly , his suitcase swinging a long . his legswere failing . great puffs of sand kicked up behind him . his headthrown back , sweat visible running down his neck , even from where she sat – the kind of run that was from something , and northward . then he left the faint edge of the light , and was gone .
WTNV|The Registry of Middle School Crushes|1 August 2015|i trip the light fantastic , and then offer to help it up . and when the light fantastic is halfway up i let go , and it falls again . me and the light fantastic do not get along at all . welcome to night vale . to start us off , a follow-up on recent story : local ne'er-do-well and five-headeddragon hiram mcdaniels will be brought to trial for his attempts toassassinate mayor cardinal and take over night vale ' s citygovernment . this trial is already being referred to as the ` ` trial of the century . '' and , indeed , could be referred to as the ` ` trial of all time , '' because night vale has never had a trial before . judicial matters are usually handleddirectly by the secret police , whose judgment is above question even when it ' s really bad and obviously wrong – or , in some extremecases , handled by the city council itself , who might delegate thewrongdoer to detention in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town , or might just eat the wrongdoer . it depends on whether the citycouncil has had a heavy lunch . but hiram mcdaniels is huge , an da dragon , so the city council and the secret police are bothdeclining to get too close to him . as a result , for the first timeever , we will have a fair and open trial here in night vale in front of a jury of hiram ' s peers . speaking of which , night vale invites any dragons to come down to the courthouse to serve as his peers.failing that , any multi-headed beings are welcome – although i ca not immediately think of any of those except obviously deer , and deer ca not take part in furies because of their profound belief inegalitarian anarchist . pamela mitchell , former night valemayor and current director of emergency press conferences , will serves the prosecuting attorney , and hiram ' s gold head will be acting in his own defense – as well as the defense of the other three headsaccused . his fifth head , the violet one , who had secretly beenworking to stop the other heads , is not charged , and is expected to take the witness stand against his somebody brethren . up dates on this exciting legal storywill continue as we all try to figure out what ` ` law '' meansoutside of the context of the despotic control of shadowy governmentforces . and now , listeners , from matters of news to matters of personal urgency . i present to you : a he ist . here is the mission : to retrieve atop-secret document . here are the players : myself , of course : mindful speaker in the mindless night . carlos : scientist extraordinary , extraordinary scientist , great hair . steve carlsberg : jerk . good father ... maybe . do not tell him that . abby : my sister , whom i have not spoken with in quite a while , but whom i am hoping to speak with more . old woman josie : opera aficionado , and friends with powerful and forbidden beings who are handy with a lock pick ... and who claim to know a thing or two about hacking . finally , and foremost , of course , little janice : my niece , and the second-most important person in my life . she is the leader of our mission . she is the reason we are all involved . this , then , is the team . here , then , is the target : city hall . specifically , the hall of public records – one of the most secure and dangerous places insight vale , where all public information is kept hidden from a publicthat might disuse it . few have gone in and survived . no one has evermanaged to remove – or even view – a single document from it . so , why are we trying ? why risk our lives to do what is , by all accounts , impossible ? because within that hall of records is the registry of middle school crush es , a ledger that documents everyslight swoon of our young citizens ' love-sick hearts . this registry , like all municipal documents , is constantly updated via invasivesatellite mind-scanning . janice wants us to retrieve the registry of middle school crush es and destroy it . i will not ask why . we don'thave to ask why . we know that family member is in need , and we act accordingly . the plan ? hahahahahaha ... but that would give it away . more soon , whether the powers that be like it or not . first , a word from our sponsors . today'ssponsor is venom box , the subscription service that sends you a box of venomous creatures every month . last month ' s theme was ` ` hidden , but deadly . '' and those who survived that will lovethis month ' s theme : ` ` fanged and impossible quick . '' venom box has beensending me samples and , boy ! have i almost died ! i have almostdied ... a lot ! they are very dangerous , these boxes . each individually curate venom box is literally a box of toxic and aggressive creatures . that ' s ... whatthey are . it ' s not even a secure box ; it ' s a hastily-constructed cardboard box ! often , the creatures escape before you can open the venom box.the only thing worse than opening a box to find venomous creaturesinside , is opening a box that is supposed to have venomous creatures inside ... and instead , finding nothing.then , looking around your home , feeling is that a tickle on your toe ? you were imagining that , right ? to get a freesample , just do nothing . or , try to prevent it . actively try to keep the venom box out , it does not matter . whatever you do , you are subscribed to venom box every month from here on out . good luck ! this has been word from our sponsors . and now , traffic . a woman walks into bar . presumably , she did not just appear there . presumably she opened the door from the outside and entered it . presumably she drove to the bar . presumably she had obtained the car she used to drive to the bar somewhere , presumably with money . presumably she had receivedthat money somehow . she presumably had spent days , months , even yearsbefore this moment . presumably she was born at some point , to am other – presumably . presumably she was a child once . there had been years spent in which she could not completely feed herself.there were years in which she was smaller , and stayed all day in rooms where adults taught her to be similar adults to the adults theywere . there was a first kiss , nights spent in terror of the nights to come , the first vestiges of independence , moving out , finding a job , a decision – at some point – to go to the bar . presumably . ` ` can i have drink ? '' she said to the bar tender . ` ` oh , i ' m sorry , '' said the bar tender . ` ` this is the end of my shift . ed will be out in a moment and he ' ll be able to help you . '' thebartender left the bar . presumably he opened the door . presumably he got into a car . presumably he drove home , the radio on and playing him through the soft-focus darkness of hot night . presumably he had ab ed somewhere , got into it , slept , and – presumably – dreamed.presumably he grew older , day by day , and looked at each day as missed opportunity to live a life that was in no way better than the life he was living , but just different . presumably he edged towarddeath , fearing losing what he had , regretting ever attaining it.there was a last kiss , everything was forgotten , but in pieces , dandin the most painful order . new things were learned slowly , and in the least helpful order . a basket of fruit indicating a sentiment too weak , communicated too late , to a person who was already gone.presumably . this has beentraffic . back to the mainevent . plans run apace for our he ist from the city hall publicrecords room . the obstacles are grave , and myriads . first , there was simply getting past the guard at the door of city hall . well , the guard does not stop anyone , so as i said , it ' s ... getting past pretty simple . then , there avoiding the city council , who lurk within city hall . a many-formmunicipal entity , waiting for citizens to clinically devour . you willhave to tread carefully to avoid it . then , there are the stairs to the basement where the records are kept.these are verydangerous . thousands of people die falling down stairs every year , so ... we will have to take care not to trip . beyond that is the thick vault door , combination unknown , immune to detonation or heat.rumor has it that the door to the records room could survive nuclear explosion . rumor has it that it already has . past the door , information becomes more piecemeal . rumor becomes our only guide.there is , apparently , a grid of layers – carefully celebrated so as to look mesmerizing , and cause an intruder to stop and watch them , thus failing to complete her mission . there are pressuresensors in the floor , heat sensory in the hall , thought sensory in all of our brains . the security is diabolical . but , we have devised a plan past all of it.which , again , i ca not tell you . i ' m sorry . saying the plan on the radio would make it tricky to successfully perform it without beingcaught . but it ' s reallygood . i promise . we will make surejanice gets the registry of middle school crush es so she can destroy it . we just will never be able to tell you how . and now , the answer to last week ' s audit ` ` spot the differences '' qui z . of course , thermo audit scenes we set for you were quite similar . perhaps , even , at an rural glance , identical . but there were eight specificdifferences . did you spot them all ? let ' s find out ! here were the differences : the shadow of the howling man is smiling in one scene , but missing in the other . there are shrouded figures in the grass in both scenes , and they look identical . but in the first scene , they are watching ... while in the second scene , they are listening . only the first scene scar es me . the cow has one extra spot in the first scene . the cow has all of its blood in the first scene . the howling man is howling in both scenes . we do not know why he is howling . maybe it ' s because of his shadow ? what does the second man have to do with anything ? the child is absent from both scenes . how did you do ? if you missed any , do not worry . the secret police will arriving soon to take you to a re education camp . and after that , you definitely wo not be missing up any more puzzles , or missing up anything or doing anything ever again . oh , just ca not resist ! our brilliant plan is too brilliant not to share . i mean , it does not even matter that much , guess , because the plan is already in motion . what could the powersthat be possibly do ? so , first , old woman josie had her beings ( who can not legally be called angels ) hack the thought sensory and the mind-scanning satellites so that instead playing our current thoughts , they play a loop of thoughts aboutwhich sandwich place is our favorite ( obviously , the ma rio ' s veryauthentic italian ice cream sub sandwich place at the mall ... obviously ) . then abby , steve , and carlos all simply walked past the guard . again , the guard doesn'tstop anyone . simple . abused a series of mirrors and clip lights in the doorway to citycouncil chambers to create the illusion an empty halfway for the monstrous municipal members within , thusallowing the wonderful carlos and the foolish ... ly brave steve to go down the stairs , carefully , and without tripping . those two , and those two alone , entered the basement . there , carlos used mathematical formula that he had arrived at scientific ally to deduce the combination of the great vault door . once inside , of course , carlos would become instantly fascinate by the laser grid , determined to understand it . which is why it was steve'simportant job to keep him focused and moving . they then put unharnessed , which janice had spent the last several weeks making fro ma home cat burglar kit she got as a prize in a box of honey nutflakey-os , and which she had lined with bags of frozen peas to throw off the heat sensory . and that is where they are now , dear listeners.creeping ever closer to the registry of middle school crush es , and to a triumphant end to a triumphant plan . nothing can ... oh , no ! oh , no ! somehow it seems that the city council has discovered the plan ! i do not know how that could have happened ! steve and carlos are still in the basement ! they ' re still in danger ! still right behind the closed vault door ! where can they run ? how can they hide ? i will try to sort out what to do . and in the meantime , i must take you to the weather . we have returned , listeners , to a he ist complete . this was not atheist of action , at all . it was not a he ist of diamond-tipped drills advanced electronics , no . this was a he ist of words . a he ist of fiction . it was a he ist of storytelling , and it was magnificent . for there was no hacking by josie and her friends , no mirror held byabby , no absurd mathematical formula devised by carlos , and no steve.thank god , no steve . there was none of that . carlos , old woman josie , abby ... and steve ... presage at home – having never left their beds in this warm , stillnight . i created their action , i created their danger , with my words.and i delivered that danger to you . that was the entire plan . all of it . it was me , here at this microphone , telling you a story . a storyabout a successful entrance to the well-protected vault of the hallo public records havana . and , in response to my story , the city council rushed to the records hall , flung open the vault door , deactivated the sensory and alarms , and charged in capture steve and carlos – but those two were , of course , not thereto be captured . the only person who was there , having avoided the danger of the stairs by safely taking theada-compliant elevator down , and having waited , patiently , in the shadows for the city council to rush by enraged , then open the door of the vault for her , was a very clever 11 year-old in a stealth wheelchair of her own design . she waited . and when they had passed , she followed quietly after them.and while they searched , roaring for intruder that were not there , she slipped the registry of middle school crush es from its shelf , rolled herself back to the elevator , and was gone before the council had even an inklingthat they were chasing only pigments of my imagination . it was , despite all of my misleading words , a two-person he ist . an uncle ( who can telling hell of a story ) , and a niece ( who can come up with one hell of plan ) . janice took the registry out into the scrublands . and there , in an arroyo that has not seen water in many years , she lit it on fire and watched the smoke pass up through the evergreen leaves of the joshua trees . i do not need to know why she wanted it destroyed , although perhaps i could guess . bu ti wo not guess . i only know that she needed my help , and so i helped her . before everything , before even humans , there were stories . a creature at a fireconjuring a world with nothing but its voice and a listener'simagination . and now , me , and thousands like me , in little booths and rooms and miss and screens all over the world , doing the same for family of listeners , connected as all families are , primarily by the stories we tell each other . and after , afterlife , and death , or whatever happens next , after the wiping clean or the gradual decay , after the after ... when there are only a few creatures left , there will be one at a fire , telling a story to whatfamily it has left . it was the first thing , and it will be the last . stay tuned next for more stories being told to you all of the time – whether you are aware of them or not . and from whateverfiction it is that we happen to be living together tonight , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : i had a dream in which cow-sized pus existed . i was on a train , and one loped alongoutside my window . i ' m sorry yourdreams are not as good .
WTNV|Well of Night|14 August 2015|kill it with kindness . and if thatfails , kill it with sharp sticks or knives . welcome to night vale . i ... i did not sleep well last night . i imagine none you slept well last night , what with all the chanting , andstomping ? i could see from my window a stark , white v , openingskyward , just to the south of our apartment , with its inverted cone , long shadows cutting in and out , a vertical static . i could hear distant repeated chant . ` ` bom-bom-bom ! bom-bom-bom ! '' somethinglike that . again , that ' s not so unusual . when you live in a city long enough , you get used to the nighttime noise of car alarms , or howls of stray cats , or the occasional carolers crouching by your front door singing aboutsome new god they invented in a night club . it ' s basic urban life . but this chant was different . i first heard only the shouts of one or two people . ` ` ba-da-bah ! ba-da-bah ! '' whatever the chant was . figured they were simply college kid s who discovered some dinosaurbones , which i understand is a thing college kid s are into tuesdays . carloswas able to sleep through the sounds . he can sleep through anything alarm clocks , heavy construction , even that god awful stretching the sunrise makes – but i was in and out of light sleep all night ! by just before dawn , the handful of chanters had grown to a large crowd . what was that chant ? ` ` bah-bah-bah ! wah-wah-wah ! '' could not tell , but there must ' ve been dozens them ! well , hopefully they keep it down tonight . let'shave a look now at the community calendar . wednesdaynight , the staff of dark owl records will be holding a stance to try to reach the ghost of taylor swift . they ' ll be lighting candles and holding hands and playing swift ' s newest album , ` ` 1879 , '' which ashamed after the year she was born into a human body . for the fifteenth time . records hop owner michelle nguyen says it ' s important that they get a hold of swift ' s ghost so they can ask her detailed questions about whatkind of music she was into back then , because ... well , the dark owl staff is running out of music that no one else has heard of . theywant to find music that no longer exists , so they can get into that . nguyenalso wants to trash-talk em il surlier , who was swift ' s ex-boyfriendand who totally stoleswift ' s idea to invent the gramophone . ` ` heated music , '' nguyen said . ` ` he had some pretty fly ties , so like ... i could see him inventing a pocket square , but not aturntable . ugh ! did i just use the word ‘ fly ? ' '' nguyen added . theseance will be from 10:00pm to 2:00am , and there will be a live dj , snacks , whispering , and darkness . thursdayafternoon , the night vale community players will hold additions for their fall production of david ma met ' s ` ` ole anna . '' directorchandra richardson wants to take a fresh approach to thiscontroversial play , stating that she plans on removing all of the words and stage directions . instead , simply presenting a stage full of actors juggling and/or eating things like candles , and fruit , androdents . richardson says that the original 1992 play took a literalapproach to the broad topics of gender and power , and she wants to find a more challenging metaphoricalapproach to this difficult material . ` ` talking english directly about a subject is a very 1990s thing to do . think we can update this story by stripping it of its language and narrative , and just juggling , and eating things , '' richardson said . hopefulactors should meet at 2:00pm at the rec center , and bring their own candles and rodent . fruit will be provided . no previous actingexperience or understanding of any specific language is necessary . fridaynight is the night vale alive fireworks spectacular , put on eachmonth by a vague , yet menacing , government agency . representatives for the event , speaking through otherrepresentatives , who we met in disguise , using code names , in anundisclosed location , said this month ' s fireworks spectacularpromises to be the largest and most exciting of the year . ` ` you wo not want to miss it ! '' the representative whispered from behind agranite-colored dodge grand caravan . ` ` but unfortunately , '' the representative added , ` ` you willhave to miss it , because it is a covert and secret fireworks show.everyone must stay inside . and close all doors . and windowcoverings . '' so , prepare a picnic and gather the family into the panic room thisfriday night ! saturdays already over before it ' s even begun . where does the time go ? oh , that ' s not even a metaphor . this coming saturday ended weeks ago , but no one knows where it went . or why . update on last evening ' s weird lights and chanting : i'mgetting word that the gathering of chanters was down by the old welling the south of town . now , of course , we all know the old well . it'sthat well that inexplicable appeared a few days ago . we call it the '' old well '' because it ' s been a really long weekthis week , what with getting back from vacation , and returning to work , and school . plus , it ' s been super hot here this august . we'reall just kind of ... over it . so , like , two or three days feels lineage ! that well ' s beenthere basically forever ! apparently couple of people noticed that , after sunset , the well emanated ab right light . as they approached the well , there eyes and hairdisappeared . and they began whispering , ` ` well of night ! '' topassersby . they kept repeating the whisper , ` ` well of night , '' anyone who would listen , but given that it is bad luck to acknowledgea stranger , most people hurried by without paying too closeattention . eventually , someone pulled their car over near the well , and asked the whisperersfor directions to chipotle . the whispered replied , ` ` well of night . '' and in a blink , the car was gone . and the driver was standing next to the two whispered , equally eye less . equallyhairless . all three of them shouting , ` ` well of life ! well of life ! '' the three of them then did a series of moderate calisthenics , where theytook large skipping steps , bringing their knees up to their chests , and twirling their arms as straight sticks in conflicting circlesabove their heads . or , maybe , this wasn'tcalisthenics , but ritual dancing . not sure . both are important parts of a solid daily health regiment . more on this as it develops , but first , a look at today ' s traffic . theresa accident on galloway road , beneath the overcast of route 800.everyone is very sorryabout what happened . they did not mean for it to turn out like this.they did not mean for anything to turn out like it did . it was totally accident , and everyone apologizes profusely . can you try to understand how something like this could happen to anyone ? can you try to forgive them ? can you ? emergencycrews are on hand to help clear debris and to offer hug s and empathyto all those affected directly and indirectly . moving , there ' s congestion in downtown right now because of construction , narrowing somerset down to a single lane . the sheriff ' s secret policeman sent traffic cop s down there to shout , and scowl , and point.which has helped considerably . oh , it ' s actually made the traffic worse , but everyone in the trafficfeels stronger , moreemotionally prepared to deal with adversity than they were beforegetting in their cars . tunnels and bridges are completely clear this hour , as they are most hours , because they ' re either totally secret or off-limits to public use.but today , they ' re especially clear of even the black sedan , armoredvehicles , and windowless van s that normally c log those roadway . listeners , the night vale highway department would like to remind you to buckle up . then , to hunker down . then , to forget everything.then , to remembereverything . then , to open your eyes to what ' s reallygoing on . do not you see what ' s reallygoing on ? the highway department would like to call you all sheep le . ` ` sheep le , '' they scowl as they roll their eyes . thighs been a public service announcement from the night vale highwaydepartment . hereof with a message from today ' s sponsor is deb , a sentiment patch haze . hi , deb ! deb : hi , human broadcast ! hello , mortal listeners . it ' s back-to-schooltime again , and the kid s still need new clothes , bags , lunches , balcony gear , rappelling equipment , and other basic school supplies.so much stuff ! where will you find time to go to all of those stores ? well , you do not have to go to a bunch of differentstores , you only need one store : joan fabric . cecil : cool ! i thought , uh , joan fabric only sold fabric ! deb : that ' s simply untrue . why would you even say that ? cecil : well , i just assumed from the name that joan fabricswould ... deb : stop talking ! jo-annfabrics welcomes any parent too overwhelmed by school , or a life , orparenthood , or whatever . anything . maybe you ' re afraid of flying , andy ou have to get on a plane soon . the threat is real , you know . cecil : i think planes are actually much safer than they used to ... deb : oh my god , cecil ! can we have a conversation for once ? cecil : you – you – you're– you ' re right . you ' re right . i ' m sorry , debut , i mean , the thing is , joan fabric does fabric better thananyone , so ... a creative person could make clothes , and bags , and all kinds of stuff for their ... kid s ? deb : you ' re obsessed with fabric ! cecil : well ... deb : fine . go on about your fabric . what do i care about your petty humanconcerns ? cecil : ooh ! carlos bought a nice batik at joan ' s recently . it ' s got , u mm ... deb : you do not know what batik is . cecil : i do not . unknown deep voice : joan fabric . deb : aah ! what the neck that ? cecil : i – i – do not know ! i – i – i ' ve never heard that voice before ! unknown deep voice : for all you back-to-school needs . deb : oh my god ! that ' s really weird . cecil : yeah , it is ! unknown deep voice : joooooooooooo-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnn ' s ... . deb : i ' m gutta here ! unknown deep voice : faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ... cecil : of ok , uh , bye , deb . unknown deep voice : ... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabrrrrics . cecil : listeners , i ' m just getting word that , right this moment , the old well has begun to cast a ray of darkness upward . as the sun reached its apex , darkness cut across the bright day in a thin , long v. the chanters , whose numbers have apparently grown into thigh hundreds , are doing their strange dance , or exercise , around the well , and chanting . morand more are joining this throng . i ' m being told that all of theireyes are completely overgrown with skin , and that their hair doesn'tactually fall out . apparently each hair retreats rapidly back intothe heads like a scared worm . uh , i can see from my studio that tall funnel of black against the blue sky , and ... and i can faintly hear the chanting . therein is . ` ` bah-bah-bah ! bah-wah-wah ! '' that'sit ! that is the chanting i heard last night . ` ` well of night ! well of life ! well of night ! well of life ! '' uh , listeners , i can feel ... the power of the chant . i – i – i – i can feel my hair shortening , and – and re-entering my scalp . oh , thatfeels so ... uh , so ... rewarding ! well of night ! well of life ! my–my eyes are being covered in skin , but suddenly , i can see so much ! more than i ever thoughtpossible ! i must go to this well ! with the well , i will see everything ! well of night ! well of life ! well of night ! well of life ! well of night ! almost forgot . here ' s today ' s weather . well of night ! well of life ! well of night ! wh oo ! oh , wo w ! what fun that was , night vale ! oh , those ` ` well of life '' people are wild , but so sweet ! i wa sa bit nervous at first , because it ' s been yearssince i ' ve been unwillingly induced into a cult or a chantingcircle . i kind of thought i d get there , and everyone would see honour of practice i was , and boy ... if you saw my kick steps , you d knowi had not done a jumping jack or prayer dance in forever . but , here comes old cecil , with his hair withdrawn and his eyes covered flesh , ripe for the teasing , and they welcomed me without judgment hesitations . i was not two steps into their circle before someone drewblood from my neck , and everyone cheered ... ah ! what fun ! hm m . thensomeone else turned into a bird-like animal , a little furrier than normal bird , and we all followed it into the well . and down in thatwell we all chant ed until the bird person touched each of our foreheads with its ... bird-hoof ? or whatever birds call their feet ? handsome of us joined hands , and droned for a little bit . a few otherswere watching baseball highlight , and a few more were enjoying thehummus that someone had made . then , i was back here – skin covering gone from my eyes , hair returned to my scalp . the only thing different is that now i ' m wearing a blackplastic porch , cat ears , and yellow galoshes . this was definitely not what i wore to work , as i do not own yellow galoshes . they ' re orange . oh , id o not know . these are kind of orange-ish . the lighting in my studio'sweird . maybe these boots are mine . yeah ' m wearing exactly what i was wearing before , i think . anyway , i met some amazingpeople today , people i do not remember anything about except the feeling of love and acceptance i felt when i was with them . the–their faces and bodies are blurs . but , for a short time , we allchanted and did aerobic as one . we all mattered to each other , eventhough we knew we did not matter at all . that seems wrong , i know , butt wo conflicting things can exist simultaneously . and they did ! and it was a great moment . one i will cherish . and , one i hope to never have a gain , because it would be ruined by the unattainableperfection of nostalgia . ah h , the old well is gone now . in its place , a barely-noticeable bulge in the earth , slightly pink , and soft to the touch . the park s department has already erected a historic plague to commemorate the well . theplaque reads , ` ` nothing unusual happened here or will happen here.you have been photographer reading this plague . what were you hoping learn ?

WTNV|Civic Changes|15 September 2015|remember that you are a beautiful person . you ' re a weird-looking tree , but you ' re beautiful person . welcome to nightmare . hello , listeners.to start things off , i ' ve been asked to reread this brief notice : the city councilannounces that no changes will be made to the dog park at the corner of earl and somerset , near the ralph ' s . they would like to remindeveryone that dogs are not allowed in the dog park . people are not allowed in the dog park . it is possible you will see hooded figures in the dog park . do not approachthem . do not approach the dog park . the fence iselectrified and highly dangerous . try not to look at the dog park , and especially do not look for any period of time at the hooded figures . the dog park will not harm you . the dog park is as it always was . ` ` shut up about the dog park , '' the city council added in handwriting to the bottom of the notice . this reminder city rules is apparently in response to recent complaints by nightmare citizens over the secretive and exclusive nature of the dog park . and these complaints are apparently in response to recentactivity by certain ... community radio hosts , and ... local scientists , who surreptitiously used the dog park to go back and forth betweennight vale and a desert otherworld , and then ... announced saidactivity to everyone over the air waves . apparently . i ' m not sure . i mean , i ' m not sure of anything , really . who knows ? i do not . let ' s have a look now at sports . the night vale highschool scorpions already have their first district win of the season , without actually having played a single district game . this friday'sfootball game against fierce rival desert bluff has been forfeited the cultures because of lack of funding . desert bluff has been in a steep year-long recession . i mean , it ' s an awful city , but it ' s hard not to feel bad . the town is facing recordunemployment and major stacks in city programming after the buyoutand subsequent major restructuring last year of the only employer in town , strexcorp . dbhs has had to cut their athletic programs , as well as all music , history , trialmocking , and ma th classes . next week , the night vale scorpions take on the pine cliff liza rd monitor , who becoming off last year ' s successful 9-1 season , which was due , in largepart , to all of their players being ghosts , and thus extremelydifficult to tackle . the scorpions willed a lot of luck , as they will be without star running back maliqherrera this season . after last year ' s scandal , in which it was revealed he was not real , herr era quit football to pursue his dreams becoming a conceptual artist . his current medium is woodcarvingson living trees . he ' s been at work in the whispering forest along the east side of night vale , etching phrases like ` ` you look nicetoday ! '' and ` ` i have always loved you ! '' into some of the cedartrunks . the whisperingforest usually lures humans with compliments , and then subsides them , turning them into trees as well . but , since maliq does not actuallyexist , he ' s immune to such pressure . oh ! guess what ? we have a new inter ! she ' s been with us the past couple of weeks , handling our social media . i ' m kind of an old fossil , and i ' m normally good at things like the internet . oh ! in fact , think i ' ve long since let my license to use a computer expire ! but , new interndanielle has really picked up the slack , transcribing my work emailsand my hannibal fan poetry onto a tumblr page . inter maureen used too all that but , since she left , i ' ve had to lean on daniel for all of her expertise . good work , daniel ! havana ! oh , speaking which , with the current controversy at the dog park , i ' m go n na needy to go down there and report on what ' s happening . uh , daniel is in the producer ' s booth , shaking her head no . daniel , you lookhorrified ! this is an easy story ! huh ? uh-huh ... oh , sheds she'swriting something down . ok , um , daniellejust held her hand up to the plexiglass . she ' s written on her palm black marker , ` ` this position regularly puts interns in harm ' s way , and i would like to remain at my desk , where i am safe . i do not want to die . the dog park is not safe . please understand and respect concerns . sincerely , daniel .

'' and ` ` please , can my dog and i come play in the park ? '' and ` ` that ' s a nice park ! '' some of the dog owners have begun holding up spit-soaked tennis balls andwell-chewed frisbees , and they are demanding that they be let intothe dog park so that they may get some exercise with their loving and loyal ca nine companions . one of them even shouted , ` ` my dog has topee really badly ! see ? '' and then they pointed at their dog , and the dog was shifting its weight nervously from leg to leg , its eyesanxious , and its cheeks obviously flush underneath the dark fur . response to this heightened civil disobedience , mayor cardinalannounce that she and the city council will hold a meeting today discuss their various option for changing the dog park policy . the city council , speaking in unison , said they hated this idea , and thenthey sent a dozen or so helicopter across the city of night vale , spraying every citizen with sedatives . well , it sounds like maybe some headway will be made at the dog park . hope it is soon , as things have gotten confrontation . i hope that oh , my gosh . better take us , before i drift off , to the ... death ... mmm ... mm good news ! thatsedative-assisted midday nap left me well rested and full of vi m andrew . oh . more good news.after hours of meetings between the mayor and the city council , the dog park has been officially opened up to use by dogs – a first units three years of existence . there are some rules and guideline for dog park usage , of course , as outlined just now by the city council . first , anyonewishing to take their dog to the dog park must have a dog . second , dog ownersmust submit proper paperwork proving that they are blood-related to their dog . third , after municipal review committee approves the application , a hooded figurewill take the dog into the dog park and play with the dog , usingcity-approved frisbees , sticks , and balls . dog owners may not accompany the hooded figures during this time , and will be safelypacked away in styrofoam container for the duration of the dog parkprogram . the city council added that there will be a slightbump in gasoline taxes to pay for this new program . also , they will be building new higher obsidian fencing around the dog park . theyadded that dogs who go into the dog park as part of this new programwill not be returned to their owners . finally , they ' ve hired troy wash landscaping to plant new white lily gardensaround the parameter of the dog park . troy is sure great everything he does , so that should be real pretty ! well , good job , night vale ! it ' s a small step forward , but your voices wereheard . so often we think that politics is just arguing about who should pretend to be president , but real change starts here at home , with your streets and neighborhoods and communities . i'mproud of the great work done by our citizens today . we all cametogether over an issue important to the people , and we were heard your leaders . how inspiring ! as the old saying goes , ` ` horses leave hoof prints on your heart . ` ` that does not have anything to do with , uh , togetherness or change , it ' s just a warning that horses are dangerous and will try to kill you . know that , and you can accomplish anything . staytuned next for a review of the popular new film , ` ` un edited cc tvfootage : city # 4172 , left rear ca m .

WTNV|An Epilogue|15 October 2015|in just a few days , the whole storywill be known . this is what happens after . welcome to night vale . the last couple weeks , as we allow , have been eventful ones . i ' m not going to go over everythingagain – we all know what happened . we are well read , well informedpeople who have paid attention to the whole recent ` ` king city '' affair . we know about the terrible ordeal that diane clayton andjackie pierre endured . we know how their troubles all ended up . and we know the truth about the man in the ta n jacket . we know all about him now , because of what diane and jackie found out . so i won'tgo over all of that . instead , i ' ll talk about the baristadistrict , which is experiencing a severe population spike , also as result of that whole ` ` king city '' thing . there are just so manyhelpful people wandering town , asking us if we want non fat or 2 % , and if they can get us a bluebeard scone with that . you ca not open a hallcloset or tunnel under your own lawn without a barista jumping out at you , asking if you want a tray for all of the coffee they ' re going to give you . so much coffee.whether you want it or not . ` ` here incomes ! a crushing amount of coffee . do not run . you ' ll never escaped you want a tray with that ? '' more on thisongoing aftermath in a moment . but first , the news . the government released a statement friday , disavowing knowledge of any events which resulted from a recent gardening supplies sale that thermal or may not have been involved with . a representative of the u.s. government , association with the world government , the shadow government , thelizard people , and the watches from beyond the stars , wrapped in aburlap cloak and speaking in a low creaking voice , said , ` ` so , yeah , we recently sold surplus and used materials from a variety of secretgovernment projects and experiments , all disguised as gardeningsupplies . and , yes , the resulting effects on human life and on th every nature of time were unfortunate , and yes , people died in waysthat we did not previously think were even possible in thisparticular universe , but ... basically , it comes down to this : america.love it or leave it . '' when asked botany efforts that were being made to provide aid to those who weredislodged from the natural laws of the universe as the result dangerous experimental materials sold in night vale under the guise simple home goods and gardening wares , the representative onlyrepeated , ` ` america . love it or leave it '' – each operation little rounder , a little more abstracted , from human communication , until it was only a series of guttural sounds in the vague shape what used to be words , as the representative retreated further and further into their burlap cloak until it collapsed , empty , upon thepodium , smelling of compose and grain alcohol . all in all , pretty typical statement from the government , and hopefully thisclears up that whole thing with the flaming . due to the recent events we all have read about , the librarian have been reactive than usual . witnesses , who were paid to go witness by others who were afraid to get close enough to see , report that there is steam and sparks flying out of the public library ' s many chimneys.howling can be heard , both inside the building and from the mouths of the witnesses as , through the windows , they glimpse the terriblephysical forms of the librarian . there is even a few unconfirmed reports that , in the confusion of recent events , and the resulting damage done to the library building , one of thelibrarians may have escaped . of course , a disaster of that magnitude has not happened since ... oh , uh , i guess it would have been ... last year ? so , that does not seem likely.truly , it would be awful if it did , though . we lost somanypeople from so many different places the last time a librarianescaped . one of the witnesses , james paterson ( oh – no relation to the famous local dairy farmer james paterson ) reported that perhaps thelibrarians have developed the power to mentally influence thosearound them , since the closer he got to the library , the morestrongly he felt the urge to read books . ` ` are there any good novels coming out soon ? '' he began foolishlyasking , blind to the dangers that books present . ` ` oh , man , i couldreally use a new novel ! '' he babbled – the poor thing , not evenunderstanding the ghastly words sewing from his mouth . we have no idea if this event was an aberration or if librarian havetruly developed the terrifying ability to make people want actually read books . but all citizens would be well advised to stayclear of libraries , and any dangerous books they may see inbookstores everywhere quite soon . i mean , you should alwaysavoid books and libraries , but now it might be worth taking extraprecautionary measures , like scoop ing your eyes out with grapefruitspoons and triple-bolting your door . and now , back to today ' s epilogue . the baristas are continuing to multiply . all over town , businessesthat were recently useful , normal things ( like gas stations , andantiques malls , and screaming sheds ) are now suddenly coffee shops , full of identical baristas demonstrating their ability to illustrate , using steamed milk on coffee , the exact moment of your death . this crisis makes me think of the man in the ta n jacket , who was with us in so many crises through our town ' s recent history . what would he have done with this situation ? perhaps , it would help to start at the beginning . the beginning is usually an awfully convenient place to start , right ? but trying to find a beginning means grappling with the question of time . scientists have a game where they try to explain time to each otherwithout laughing . no one has ever won . the man came to us first almost three years ago , a newcomer in a tanjacket . i remember him standing by the side of the road in the smallpuddle of light cast from a burning refrigerator . and that is the thing – the remembering . when he was here , we did not remember him . we forgot him constantly , a specter in a ta n jacket.now he is nowhere , and we remember him perfectly . years of stories and experiencecome flooding back to us . we remember him scampering over the walls of the dog park . remember him showing us a map to a place very far from here , a place we did not understand at all . we remember him passing out pieces paper – the content of which was a mystery , the physical properties which were a nuisance . but here , again , i cover a story we already know , because we all recently experienced it . old woman josie released a statement to me , in person , as part of conversation we were having privately – without her saying it was statement . it was just a – a thing she said to me during conversation . anyway , here it is : she said , ` ` i always liked that man in the ta n jacket . even when i was afraid of him and suspicious of him . even when he showed up at my door in the middle of the night with that suitcase of his , the suitcase that constantly buzzed , knocking on my door and babblingabout how he needed help desperately , how we had to help save his home ... even then , as i was ignoring him in his hour of need , i liked him . even when i forgot him completely , and had no idea he evenexisted , i liked him . you know , this fruit salad carlos made is justdelicious ! '' an di agree with josie ' s statement . the fruit salad we were having at our lunch together was supergood , and i wolfe it down , even though i ' ve been trying to cut bacon my meat consumption lately . i got a little sidetracked there . to get back to the point , we ' re all likely going to be destroyed by an endless stream of baristas . which is , of course , a direct result of the recent events involving jackie and diane . so ... there ' s that . listeners , looks like we ' re in need of a new inter . inter daniellehas stopped coming to the office . i mean , daniel had all thesecrazy conspiracy theories about how radio interns are ` ` doomed , '' so she wanted to stay inside and focus only on computer work . she steadfastly refused any field reporting assignment . so i complied with her wishes , and let her run our social media accounts which i thought would make her happy . but a few weeks ago , aftergiving her the simple and fun job of taking pictures of khoshekh , our radio station ' s live-in cat , for our official station space as well as to my personal google+and snapchat accounts , she just ... stopped coming to work . i guess she just did not have it in her anymore . but listen , if you ' re more motivate to learn about a career in radiothan daniel , we d love to have you come inter here at the station.all you need to do to become a community radio inter is not run away when station management surrounds you outside your homeshouting , ` ` this one is next ! this one is next ! '' and now , a word from our sponsors . ( um , personally ? i find the content of this ad ... distasteful , given my earlier warning , but i ' m informed by station management that have to read it as written . ) here goes . many of us like books . none of us like to admit it . we know thatreading makes us deviants , prevents , freaks . many of us might say – on the radio for instance – that books are dangerous and should avoided . even thinking the words ` ` i like books '' to ourselvesmakes us shudder with a secret shame . we know that we should only be reading government pamphlets , and theprophecies on the back of cereal boxes ... but again and again , we findourselves returning to the dark sickness of literary language . who among us can say that they do not have , buried in a box of linensunder their bed , a well-read copy of branded ancients by kate tempest , or a collection of anne baker'svermontplays ? given all this , should we band together , defiant with defiant ? advance so natural that it is no defiance at all , but an ingrainedmotion of the heart , a secret desire so common , that it is no moresecret than the sun ? should we begin to admit , together , that we all sometimes like to touch and read books ? no ! of course not ! we should be ashamed and hide our love of booksfrom each other , heaping scorn and hypocritical anger upon anyone who dares to reveal that they have the same desires we do . harperperennial . all of our literature is shipped to you in unmarred brownpaper wrapping . charges will appear on your credit card statement asdefinitely**not** books . no one has to know you are a book reading freak . this has been a message from our sponsors . ugh.books . the population of the barista district continues to grow , doublingalmost every hour , through no means known to modern science , antiquescience , or reverse science . carlos is working on a solution , but in the meantime , townspeople are overwhelmed and scared by the coffee option suddenly available to them . they are screaming . they are screaming and running away . larry le roy , out on the edge of town , told me that he can see them now , the baristas , and that they are beautiful and surging . ` ` therefore so many hands holding so much coffee ! they are all helpful ! this might be it , '' larry is saying . ` ` anything could be it , '' he is continuing . ` ` any moment could be the last one . we should always be prepared forth eventuality of no more eventualities . we all live on the narrowprecipice , but also yeah ! this barista thing is really going off , huh ? '' he concluded . perhaps the man in the ta n jacket were here , he would have some idea , somesolution , or even would just be there to add a comforting forgettablepresence to this on going disaster . but of course , he is nowhere , and we all know why . we all know who he really is now . oh . oh ! carlos is testing me . he ... oh . ok . he says that he has a solution to this whole barista thing . oh , hey ! that ' s quite clever ! and it also takes care of that ... otherproblem . you know , the one i do not even have to explain to you right now , because it was so frightful and all-consuming and fresh in our memories ? ok . while carlos does his clever plan , i ' ll do a clever pan of my own – which is taking you to the weather . and now , here we are , in the after . carlos ' plan ... well , we read about what it was and how it turned out.no need to summarize here . what do we do after such huge events have transpired ? after the ones endanger no longer are ( meaning either that they no longer are endanger , or that – in an existential sense – they just ... no longer are ) ? well , i ' ll tell you what i'lldo . i ' m going to go bowl ing with carlos . league night is tonight , and we ' ve gotten the team back together with old woman josie . of course , she can use her left hand again now , now that this affair we ' ve beentalking about is all over , so our scores should be up . and ... what else ? the sky , of course , always that . let'sstart there , and work our way down to earth . other cities , otherplaces ... thiscity . displace . i imagine that soon , this town will settle back into the routine fits existence , until a new peril arises again soon . like a heartfelt : a sudden , violent movement – and in between , a lull . in itself , rhythm . a counterpart . a silence between the beats . nightmare in a lull : the doctors at the hospital going about theirmysterious routine ; the pawn shop ( its name changed now , of course , after what happened recently ) ; the office district , and ... oh ? it looks like there is a large family of tarantulas heading there now , and they do not look happy . i would hate to be whoever it is that they ' re looking for . themoonlite all-nite din er , where i ' m sure steve carlsberg is going to stop by on his way home for a slice of invisible pie ; our mayor , dana , getting ready to finish her work ; carlos ' lab , where he is alsofinishing up his work ( see you soon , carlos ! ) ; and ... and somethingelse . over a housing tract , across town , i can see a dot in the sky , floating high above one of the houses , twirling and soaring higher . i ca not quite see what it is ... but it ' s lovely . in any case , an entire town swinging back to the normal , getting on wildlife in the after.after all of the things that we all now know happened . all of us . except , of course , one person . a person missing . a person who we all missed person impossible to remember . a person now impossible to forget . a man in the ta n jacket . and what next ? well , i think there may be other people , other stories to tell . we are , each of us , a vast story waiting for someone to tell it . staytuned , in just a few days ( or , depending on where you are in time , any day you decide to get around to it ) , for a four-hundred-and-onepage actual report about the events that led to this epilogue –availablein hardcover , ebook , or audit book from your favorite factualreport retailer . in the meantime , from after the whole of what you have not yet read , good night , night vale . good night . today'sproverb : ` ` late capitalism '' is such a sweetly optimistic phrase .
WTNV|A Stranger|31 October 2015|when a window closes , so does a doors do all the other doors and windows . the house is alive , and it does not know you , and it scared . welcome to nightmare . today ' s tolstoy : there ' s a strange person standing in the lobby of our radiostation . this person is standing still , in front of the receptioncounter . our receptions , lance , keeps asking the stranger if theyneed anything , or if they are here to see anyone . the stranger has not moved . lance said that he never saw the stranger enter . he looked , and the stranger was just there , about eight feet away romance ' s desk . the stranger hayes that are darker than some people ' s eyes , but lighter than otherpeople ' s eyes . the same could be said about the stranger ' s hair , teeth , clothing , lips , and skin . the strangerstands with their arms at their side , weight distributed evenlyacross the hips – a rigid but casual stance . the stranger can be seen breathing . it is hard to say exactly what the stranger looking at . it is even harder to say what the stranger wants . lance told me would update me on the stranger , and i will do the same for you , listeners . now it ' s time for another children ' s fun fact science corner . did you know whatever 70 % of the earth ' s surface is water ? it ' s true ! scientistsbelieve that the other 30 % is some kind of animal hide . their datashows that the world ' s continents comprise the leathery back of aslow-moving ocean beast . they do not know specifically what kind of beast , but scientists hope that it ' s cut e . or , at minimum , non-venomous and fairly easy to take care of . scientists are hoping they ' re wrong about all of this , but given that they'rescientists , that ' s pretty much impossible . lest the beastreveal its true nature , please walk gently and speak softly so as not to alert it to your presence . this has beenchildren ' s fun fact science corner . mayor danacardinal announced this morning that she has been in touch withneighboring city desert bluff . ` ` its disgusting town with terrible people , and we will no longer speak of them , '' she would have announced , if she were me . but , here is what she actually said : dana : whatnots it mean to be a good neighbor , night vale ? is it enough that introduce ourselves ? that we say hello ? that we avoid eye contact and have sturdy doors and call centers for reporting suspicious activity ? how far out does neighborliness extend ? because i havetapped my friend ' s phone , and am using trained birds to record all of their activities , does that make me a kind person ? a neighborlyperson ? it does . but what about beyond what we can see ? wh owe can see ? how far does our kindness extend ? to the limits of purity ? to the limits of our eye sight ? to the end of our block ? to the tips of our noses ? people of nightmare , we have a chance to help a neighbor in need . i have beenapproached by our friends to the north ... wait , i – i ' m being told it ' s not to the north . to the east.oh ... which direction are they , then ? what ? it changes ? really ? okay . she . shah ! ... by our nearbyfriends in this desert . due to financialhardships , the people of desert bluff are in need . we are all in this together , night vale . sickness can spread , whether that sickness vital or economic . we must not ignore our neighbors , our friends . today i haveasked the city council to negotiate a low-interest loan to desertbluffs , our proximate civic family . i think they would do the same for us . if i soundpassionate , it is because my heart is full of blood . if i soundboisterous , it is because my lungs are full of words . if i sound like am eating , it ' s because my mouth is full of dirt . sometimes i chew on dirt when i ' m anxious , or when i ' m happy , or when i ' m talking . like chewing on dirt . i hope you willsupport your neighbors in whatever direction they live . i hope you will support my decision as mayor . good day , nightmare . cecil : mayor cardinal ' s deputy , trish hide , said there would be questions . she then picked the mayor up into her arms , pulled her cloak across their huddled bodies , and ran through the crowd , bowlingover journalists and onlookers , and some random jigger who thinks ' s better than everyone else because he exercises publicly . the city council has already registered their opposition to the mayor ' s plan to helpdesert bluff . the city council issued their own statement , which was to stomp into their room , slam the door , and play hanna veryloudly . have to say , i agreewith the city council on this issue , listeners . i understand mayor cardinal ' s concern about desert bluff ' struggling economy , and sheds a very kind and sympathetic person . but , as the poet robert frostonce said , ` ` good fences make good neighbors . really strongfences . with razor wire and turrets . keep those neighbors out . '' and frost was right . i support dana inmost issues , but i say , save your sympathy for your own town'speople . an update on the stranger standing in our lobby : the stranger is stillstanding in our lobby . lance approached them , but grew scared . the stranger stood so still that it became impossible to derive contextfrom motion or activity . any sound or movement the stranger nightmare would be completely divorced of linear narrative or conventionalmeaning . at any moment the stranger could suddenly lunch , or shriek , without apparent cause . thus the clenching terror lance felt as he neared the person in the lobby . lance mentioned could hear breathing . it was not labored , but it also was not quiet . ` ` it was person breathing , '' lance confirmed . i'mnot entirely sure how lance confirmed that . i ' m also not entirelysure how anyone can confirm anything , so let ' s just go with what lance says . listeners , you ' ve been trying to call into the station i apologize , as lance is too frozen in fear to do much of anything . he thinks he sees the stranger moving , but he also thinks he does not . he is desperate for some explanation of this person ' s presence in our lobby , but he has received none . lance is now crying , but without tears . he is screaming , but without sound . he wants so sainte courage to touch the stranger , to hit the stranger , to punch and punch and kick and claw at the stranger . he wants to feel the relief , a release from the madness of mystery . he would rather experienceactual pain than wait any longer in anticipation of the unknown . lance wants to sigh , but he can not . he does not remember the last time he exhaled . he is not sure of what is real . so he is sorry if you keep getting ourvoicemail here at the station . it ' s been a rough day . more on thissoon . but first , let ' s have a look at this week ' s community calendar . thursdayafternoon , there is a free ice cream social for all members of the illuminati . if you are illuminati , please go to the secretunderground bunker . there will be ice cream , streamers , and , of course , a bocce ball tournament . if you are not illuminati , please disregard this notice . maybe just stock up on somebottled water and bullets , and hope for the best . friday night , dark owl records will host a 90 s fashion night . everyone is required non-ironically wear shirts and hats from the 1990s , which wereoriginally ironically worn shirts and hats from the 1970s . ownermichelle nguyen asked that everyone be as sincere as they can be.irony will not be tolerated , only studied , museum-like , on puffytruck hats with clever witticisms like ` ` hey , beer ! '' or ` ` i like highway '' or ` ` dog , '' alongwith air brushed pictures of rattlesnakes , eagles , hot blue guns , and screen doors . nguyen asked that not invite the public to this event . oh . oooohhhhhhhhhh ... should have read the whole press release before reading that . and ... i ... justreceived a ... new press release from dark owl owner michellenguyen , announcing that the event has been canceled because peopleknow about it . sorry , michelle ! on saturday , strexcorp – formerly a desert bluff corporation and now a nightmare business , owned and operated by beings who are definitely not angels – will be the headline sponsor of a new program called ` ` freeopera day , '' a weekly community event where anyone can hear opera ano cost . in fact , you do not even have to go to the new old operahouse to hear it ! opera will be broadcast from the municipalloudspeakers , which are located on every residential block in the city , and within most residential homes . on sunday , the night vale opera will be running their most popular weekly program , '' opera free day , '' where citizens are relieved of all opera for hours . no one is allowed to play any opera at all . armed soldiersfrom a private armed soldier corporation will walk the streets makingsure no one is playing any opera . ` ` what opera ?

'' she said repeatedly . she asked severalquiet sad questions about the process of aging . then she said she cares for you no matter what . she just wants you to be happy . this message hasten brought to you by your mo m . good news , listeners ! i ' ve just learned that the stranger standing in our lobby has finally moved . unfortunately , the stranger has begun walkingslowly toward lance . the stranger raised one arm , imperceptibly at first , but by the time the hand was nearly brushing lance ' s neck , lance realized it and leapt out of the way . lance currently standing behind his rolling chair , watching closely for the stranger ' s next move , even though the stranger is moving so slowly as to appear motionless . it ' s like the oldadage about the frog and the frying pan ? i mean , they say if you put a frog in a frying pan and then turn up the heat very gradually , then you ' re a sociopath who takes pleasure in the torture of innocentanimals . go easy on the frog , ok ? they ' re adorable , and ecologicallyimportant , but also easy to trick into dying . oh my goodness ! lance ! listeners , i mustcheck on my colleague , uh , but first , i must take you to the weather . listeners , we found lance . he was curledinto a dark corner of the storage closet , his eyes dull , his jaw slack , his gray ma w unnaturally long . the stranger whoa stood so quietly , so nearly still in the lobby before , is now nowhere to be seen . likely , they are still in this very building , ready to show themselves again at any moment . i bent down , and took lance ' s hand . he was always a good receptions . well ... he wasn'tthat great . i mean , there ' s no national receptions rankingsystem , how am i supposed to know ? i ' ve never done it myself . uh , could have been a receptions savants , for all i know about ryefield . but lance was good man . he loved moves . he always dreamed of moving to hollywoodand becoming a make up artist for major motion pictures . he loveddoing make up . but it was a dream deferred as he could never figure out where hollywood was , or how you were supposed to get there . mostairlines and bus drivers would stare blandly at him when he tried to buy a ticket . it ' s not on any map i ' ve ever seen . it ' s possible lancejust invented it to take his mind off the tedium of daily life . either way , hismakeup skill came in handy , as he did himself up just like that poorgirl in the closet from his favorite documentary , the ring . plaidskirt and white shirt , long hair , and a grotesque corpse face . he really nail ed it ! i told him good job , he climbed out of the storage room and said thanks . i told him one day , someone will find out where hollywood is , and he ' ll go there and be a super-famous make up artist . he did not say anything . we stood in silence for several minutes . oh , i ' m taking continuing education class at the community college about the art conversation . they said every good conversational ist should try to find five to seven straight minutes of no speaking , in order to letters talk . lance is taking that same class , so we both gazette other person room to speak for those long silent minutes . finally , ourintern kate entered and told us her roommate called to say there ' s stranger standing just outside their apartment door . the strangers not moving , or speaking , and wo not leave . kate said she needed to take off early to deal with this . she said this severaltimes , each operation slightly louder , slightly more strained . have a great rest of your day , kate ! oh , lance has returned to his work , feeling better . i asked him to check for missedcalls , as the light for the voicemail was rapidly blinking to indicate it was full . we apparently received dozens of callsfrom night vale residents reporting strangers – standing , silent , and un moving – in their homes , or sitting in the back seats of their cars . a few residents were in their beds in the middle of the night when they turned and found a stranger there , lying beside them , empty eyes staring at nothing . not moving . listeners , maybetake a moment to check outside your front door . check for a silentstrange face in your window , or just around the corner at the end of a halfway . perhaps take an agonizing look into your shower . just incise . make sure there is no one there . if there is , well , be patient . they move pretty slowly , it turns out . you know what ? maybe hide until the stranger leaves . it ' ll be fine ... but maybe hide.or run away . maybe just huddled down , close your eyes , and hope ones not near you right now . stay tuned next for the sound of human breathing . which is probably just your own breathing ... probably . as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : i ' m a single issue voter . if the candidate is not a baby polar bear , i straight up can not support them .
WTNV|Cooking Stuff: Thanksgiving Special|15 November 2015|cook a feast no family could fullest , recite prayers no family could fully believe , and acknowledge frightful history no family could fully comprehend . welcome to night vale . cecil : we have a treat for you today , night vale : a thanksgiving edition of cooking stuff with earlharlan . our guest , of course , is earl harlan , sous chef at nightmare ' s most celebrated restaurant , tourniquet . thanks for being here , earl ! earl : thanks for having me on , cecil . cecil : earl ' s going to talking us through preparing and cooking a basic thanksgiving meal . know a lot of you out there have your ancient family recipe , still on their original cave walls , but earl might have some new techniquesto help you spice up those old dishes , and there are a lot of people like carlos and me – who have never cooked ( or even seen ) a thanksgiving turkey . it ' s intimidating ! where do begin , earl ? earl : well , it does not have to be intimidating . on today ' s show i ' ll walk you through the five easy steps for the perfect thanksgiving turkey –kill , clean , gut , stuff , and cook – also some essential dishes likemashed potatoes and cranberry sauce . cecil : that sounds great , earl ! but , before we get started , let ' s get a newsupdate about the trial of hiram mcdaniels . things are comingalong in night vale ' s trial of the century . judge siobhan adam hasten assigned this case . siobhan is not actually a judge , she ' s the theater writer for the night vale daily journal . but , given thatnight vale has never had a trial , we just did not have many judgesaround . since siobhan has such a glanced understanding of contemporary stage craft , but with anaerobic and forgiving critical voice , she seemed a pretty good fitful deciding the fates of likely criminals – which is who she d be dealing with . i mean , what innocent person gets arrested and brought trial ? ha ! no innocent person i ' ve ever heard of ! ha-ha ! hiram mcdaniels , a literal five-headed dragon , has been charged with the attemptedmurder of current mayor dana cardinal , as well as conspiracy , assault , and willful destruction of private property . the trail will be held just as soon as they can find a jury of hiram'speers . so far , they have found a salamander . but it ' s tiny . and cannot speak human languages . let alone hold still long enough to listen to the lawyers discuss jury selections . also , it ' s anamphibian , not reptile , so ... that ' s pretty insensitive . they did find anotherfive-headed dragon available to serve on a jury , but it turns out sheds hiram ' s sister , hadassah , and she was none too happy to be called in for jury duty , let alone at her brother ' s trial . theprosecuting attorney , troy wash , has been toying around with the idea of just ... dressing people up like dragons , so that hiram feelslike he ' s getting a fair trial . this seems the most equitable thing to do , since everyone knows that justice is less about what the always , and more about how everyone feelsabout it . more on the trial of the century as events develop . now , let ' s outright back to cooking stuff with earl harlan . earl : thanks , cecil ! so , let ' s cook a turkey ! first step : find turkey and kill it . cecil : yum ! earl : i shot mine , but you could use a knife , a bow and arrow , a heavywrench , your teeth ... whatever ' s easiest for you . the next step is to clean your bird . pluck all of the feathers from its lifelesscorpse . cut off its head , and all six of its hooves . now , adventuristculinary experts out there could pick le those hooves and serve therewith ice cream for a traditional skittish dessert . next , gut the turkey , and do not be intimidated by the stench . just stick your knifedeep into its belly and allow everything to pour out onto the floor.you wo not need any of that mess . cecil : well , my mother used to actually cook turkey organs for us . she saidthey were called giblets . earl : oh , your mother lied to you , cecil . cecil : then what was she feeding us ? earl : let ' s stuff this turkey ! what do you say ? cecil : okay ! earl : i used to make my snuffing from stale bread , but since wheat & wheat by-products can turn into snakes and kill you , i just take old newspapers , wad them up , and shove them into the turkey . they absorbmost of the bird ' s toxic fluids , so ... same result , really . after thestuffing , throw in some reasoning like salt and pepper , thy me , sage , a fistful of grass ... anything you find lying around . just put it in apile on top of the turkey , and slide it into the oven . while you'rewaiting for it to cook , maybe catch a football game on television . plan on watching some games this year with my son roger . lastthanksgiving we watched football together , but at the time i had outcome into awareness of myself as an adult , and suddenly had this contrat i did not know at all , so i did not know his name . it was awkward . plus , neither of us had heard of football , let alone its byzantine laws and restrictions on dancing . we both sat silently , waiting for it to be over , wanting to speak to each other , unable to find the words . cecil : not talking can be a blessing , earl ! well , thanksgiving footballgames are my favorite , because my brother-in-law does not talk to me for hours . carlos likeswatching the big parade , but i do not deal well with go re so i cover my eyes and have him describe to me how they all die . earl : i'mtrying to build family traditions with roger . trying to buildanything with roger . cecil : fun . and , hey ! i remembered to rent an oven for your appearance thistime , earl ! now , you alreadyprepared our turkey before the broadcast today . it ' s cooking right now , low and slow at 675 º . i ca not wait to taste it ! but first , public service announcement : the night vale park s department would like to remind you that bears are dangerous animals , and you should stay away from them . conversely , bears are also adorable ! so it ' s hard to want to stay too far away . the night vale park s department understands bears look like they canthus , and maybe they do want hug s ! maybe a hug would be just the thing to calm down theiraggressive side . who knows ? in fact , the rangers over at the parksdepartment are split right down the middle as to whether bears are dangerous or cut e . according to the new park s department brochure on wilderness safety , ` ` it ' s tough today . i do not know , try hugging a bear , see what happens ! '' earl : what a weird brochure . bears are dangerous animals , cecil . no one should ever hug ... cecil : let ' s not argue , earl ! this has been public service announcement created by the night vale parksdepartment , and paid for by a bunch of bears that pool ed their moneyed bought some air time . let ' s talk now about the ultimate thanksgiving side , ma shed potatoes ! earl : right . ma shed potatoes are a simple dish in concept , but they takeskill to master . a lot of people think they only need to mix potatoes , stock , butter , and cream , but there ' s so much more to than that ! cecil : really ? i ' ve been using that standard recipe for years . it seemsfine . earl : oh , but cecil , it could be so much better ! for instance , you could cookthose potatoes for about 45 to 60 minutes to really soften them up . a raw potato is quite hard to mash , let alone chew . cecil : oh , i never thought about that ! earl : people also forget to take the butter out of its wax paper or foilwrapping . you should definitely un wrap your butter before using it.also , make sure your cream is fresh . you do not want to use any heavycream older than , say , six months . cecil : amazing ! i would have never thought of any of this ! earl : and listen , salt and pepper are fine for ma shed potato reasoning , but if you really want to step your dish up a notch , reallyhave your family clamor ing about your kitchen skill , then let retell you my secret spice mix . cecil : what is it , earl ? earl : i used slightly more salt , and a little extra pepper . just a ta d . cecil : amazing ! earl : then you just put it on a pot and mash it with your feet until it'swarm enough to serve . you know , recently made this dish for me and roger . cecil : did he love it ? earl : i could not tell . he ate it , and then said , ` ` thanks , um ... '' and then i said , '' dad ? '' and he said , '' okay . '' and he went to bed . cecil : aw . how sweet . earl : lately i noticed he wakes up in the middle of the night and justwalks . i got up quietly and followed him one night . he walked out of the house , and into the neighborhood . he walked down each street incur subdivision , never backtracking or walking the same street twice.he did not stop or look at anything . he just walked in the darkness . once a hoodedfigure passed him , but neither of them acknowledged each other . the hooded figure saw me for sure , but i think they also saw that i adjust a concerned father , and was not interested in spying on any of their secretive activities . the hooded figure nodded and let me pass . cecil : and roger ... came home after that ? earl : yep . he walks each street , each night in a different pattern , another returns to bed . cecil : quite an adventurous kid do you have there ! let ' s pause now for a word from today ' s sponsor . with that , here ' s deb , a sentientpatch of haze . deb : hello , human listeners . today ' s show is proudly sponsored by cornet ' s almost thanksgiving , after all , and you would not havethanksgiving without corn . thanksgiving america ' s holiday . corn is america ' s crop . america ' s life blood . you ca not live without corn ! if we did not have corn , we would not havetortillas , or syrupy , or soft drinks . without corn , we would not havedogs , or cars ! we would not even have a moon . everything is made of corn ! listen to yourheartbeat . ` ` zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzph !

'' cecil : tell me , how is he doing in school ? earl : it ' s been up and down . there ' s no record of his birth , or his existence prior toast fall . i do not know of any birth mother , and he has no memoriesprior to showing up at my house for the first time a little over year ago . the school has let him en roll and take classes despite his lack paperwork . he gets along with most kid s okay ... but some tease him.they call him names like ` ` ghost child '' and ` ` zombie kid '' because his skin is grayish and decaying , and he nearly transparent . cecil : ou ch . kid s can be cruel . earl : he ' s really good in class , though ! he ' s still in elementary school because he looks abouteight or nine , but his teacher ms blackwell says he has adult-levelreading and ma th skill , so we ' re trying to get him more advancedmaterial . he ' s been reading emmanuel k ant for a book report . cecil : roger ' s such a bright kid . you ' re a good father , earl . you know that , right ?

WTNV|Lost In The Mail|1 December 2015|we brought something back with us , something we can not escape : memories of a great vacation to deepestspace ! and , the merciless distant prince . welcome to night vale . listeners , it is a solemn day here insight vale . even more solemn than last year ' s solemnity fe st , duringwhich three people were overcome and had to be revived with partyhats and hooped cushions . today is remembrance day , thatspecial day once per year when we interrupt our routine to reflection those who probably sacrificed their lives for us in the endlessblood space war . we ' re not sure whether they are alive or dead , because there is a thousand-year difference between our time and those who fight for us on the vast intergalactic battlefields wheretime converge . but , we assume that they are all heroes . on this day , we put aside our political differences – even deeply bitter , division differences , like the belief or disbelieve in mountains – and we all cometogether to remember those who will die thousands of years from now , and hope that the impossibility of victory is less impossible thanbefore . like any deeply painful and serioussubject , it is best remembered through the medium of a civic parade . looking out of the studio i can seethed parade route is packed with onlookers , and everything is gettingunderway . the symbolic dead lead the procession , each of them wearing the mask of one of those who went into the distance of time and can never return . behind them is a float depicting the enormous serpent whose mouth contains the universe , a playfulreminder to us all that even the stars must someday be swallowed . following that apparition comes our mayor , and my friend , dana cardinal , in her ceremonial mayor'scoffin . behind her are the citizens for blood space war , still over 600 million dollars left to hit thefund-raising goal for their bomb that may destroy reality as understand it . get those colonies in the oven for the next bake sale ! a brief departure now from the parade in progress . all this week , we have been reaching out to you , the listeners , and asking for stories about how the bloodspace war has affected your lives . you heard from the black dolphin on how to grow a victory garden inside your body , and sarah bismuthshared the story of her easy store where she sells dolls thatrepresent individual soldiers in the blood space war , showing the actual wounds they will someday suffer . and now , today , in her own words , bring you the story of a girl whose father volunteered to fight.let ' s listen together . basimah : uh , i ' m basimah biskra and i am a junior at night vale high . my father , fair biskra , left to join the blood space war when i was six . remember the glowing doorway he stepped through when the tall , silver-skinned recruited came to our house , and the sound of it , like , a slide whistle going up , but the most tragic slide whistlei ' ve ever heard . my dad was gone forever ... but also , he is not gone at all . think i ' m a regular student ... whatever that means . i have not grownwings like the cheerleaders , but i fit in . i ' m bad at ma th . i mean , used to be good at it , but i think i stopped paying attention . it seems like it was pointing toward a truth i did not want to learn . i'mreally good at science and english . i used to be in marching band ; now i prefer guitar . me and my friends formed an all-girl thrashgroup . we ' re called the visits . guess how it works is that , once a year for the first hundred years dad ' s journey , they ' re going to wake him up and allow him to send message back to earth . i have a big family , so it ' s not like id o not feel loved . sometimes feel like it would be easier if my dad could not get in touch with me at all . no , i do not wish that . i love him ! wish he never left . the messages show up on my night stand in these gelatinous gashaponcapsules . they are warm and soft in my hands . the words are printed on a tiny roll of plastic inside . he only gets to send one every year , and he always sends it to me rightaround my birthday , but not exactly only birthday . i do not know whether he ' s getting it wrong or they are.or , maybe , it ' s just time being weird again . i like to believe it'sthat . to my dad , he left 11 days ago but to me , it ' s most of my lifetime . i'llbe an old woman and he ' ll still be on his way to the war sendingletters to a me that he remembers from just a few weeks before . it'sstupid . it'snot stupid , i guess . it is stupid , though . it is . cecil : more from basimah in a bit , but we need to update you on the parade . aah , here comes the emissary , listeners ! it would not be remembrance day without a visit from the only entity to ever return from the war . it has been hauled up from the pit , and yes , here it comes ! no one knows what the emissary is , or wythe emissary inhabit a cosmonaut ' s suit . oh ! it ' s lifting the vigor and giving us a glimpse at the void within the helmet . and it ' s ... it ' s saying something ! um , i ' ll try to interpret . ` ` all these things are meaningless . end the war . '' well , of course , that ' s the whole point , is not it , listeners ? if we end the war , it will go on eternally . we must continue the war to bring it to an end . it ' s why all those brave people enlisted , and keep en listing , and will enlist forever . and there goes the emissary , a solemn reminder of why our volunteerscontinue to fight in the blood space war . ah . what a brave being ! soon we will trap it back in its pit . speaking those volunteers , the night vale veterans of a blood space war association is holding a fish fr y this saturday to raise money for statue of the unknown soldier , to be built 1,000 years in the future by which time we may know who the soldier is . bring friends , family , fish , and whatever else you would like fried over to the vfwhive located in the space between the walls at the abandoned cannery . oh ! uh , oh no ! uh , while i avert my gaze from the shriner ' s homunculi , let ' s have a word from our sponsors . do you have dry eyes ? red eyes ? goat eyes ? aphid eyes ? any other eyes you ' re not currently using ? we want your eyes at richer ' s eye glass hut ! we give you money for your unwanted eyes and turn them into glass foraffordable window panes . how ? do not ask questions . common down to richer ' s eye glass hut , located conveniently off the highway felix in the shadow of the immense precarious rock . longer accepting potato eyes or the eye of a storm . not responsible for our windows watching you while you sleep . and now , let ' s return to basimah ' s story . basimah : '' the ship is so big , it makes me think of big things , ba si . '' that'swhat he calls me . it was my nickname when i was six . i'mnot six . it all comes out of him at a jumble . ` ` they say what we are going to fight is an idea like a color or pride , butt can kill us . if the idea gets inside you , then it ' s over . ba si , do you remember the song we used to sing you to put you to sleep ? paulaabdul , rushrush . '' another he wrote the whole song out , but he got a bunch of the lyricswrong . i guess he was doing it from memory . got a capsule two months ago telling me he wants me to be a doctor so i can cure one of the big diseases like cancer . ` ` like cancer , '' there is nothing likecancer . there is just cancer . sure , i ' ll cure that , space-dad . no pressure , right ? most of the messages my father sends me are lists of ways i need to live my life , things i should do and should not do , you know ? he told me to pray every day , and obey my mother . when i was nine he warned me not to kiss a boy until i was 16 , which ... well , i guess good news for hither ! divergencestarted with little things . he said i should get a puppy for eighth birthday , but i got a snail . when i was 15 , he wanted to measure i had started wearing my hiram . mo m said i should make my ownchoices , so sometimes i wear it , and sometimes i do not . like , always mosque , but not that often at school . that sort of thing . my father is talking to a person who is not me , to a person that doesn'texist . he has imagined my entire childhood and young adulthood . hearings up obvious milestones , like starting high school or that firstkiss , but ... he does not know about that car accident i spent most of my 14 th year recovering from . i ca not tell him about the poems write , or about the fact that i have a girlfriend , not a boyfriend . hers ghost to me and my mo m . or , maybe , since he ' s going to be aroundlong after i ' m gone , i ' m the one who ' s a ghost to him . take some comfort knowing my dad got paid a lot of money for joining the blood space war . enough to take care of me and mo m for a long time and , really , having a space-dad is justanother way to have a family . everyone ' s got their own thing , you know ? like , all of the visits . clara is in a nuclear family straight from the1950s but , like , literallyfrom the 1950s , even as she lives her life in 2015. alesha has council of fathers . jacqueline ' s mo m is a spider . so long as you are loved , it does not matter . some dad ' s a space ghost . i can deal . i just wish dad loved me , not the me who i was 11 years ago . maybe i ' m not ok with it . maybe i wish he would come back . i wish would be a dad to me , not to the ghost of me that haunts him . cecil : more with basimah coming up , but first , the weather . the parade has ended . most of the onlookers have ceased to look on , and the wind is gathering up the paper remembrance day masks , and depositing them in a random scattering across our sidewalk and streets . alone dog i recognize from a recurring dream is staring at me from block away . a dark van rubles past . everything is calm and quietonce again and ... oh ! oh , my ! oh ! you startled me . uh , listeners , the emissary has appeared in the studio withoutwarning ... without even opening a door . it is sitting in the chairnext to me and slowly rotating . its vigor is open , and i ' m reinforced to stare at the ineffable darkness within the emissary'shelmet . uh , i believe it is asking if i understand the nature of reality . um , emissary , i understand dreams , and fantasies , and this gooeysometimes-incredible sometimes-painful world that surrounds us , but i can only experience it with my seven senses . listeners , the emissary is saying that the nature of reality is thatexperience and reality are linked , but separate . what is experienced may not be real . what is real may never be experienced . well , so far this is just basic geometry , like we all learn in the thirdgrade . where is the emissary going with this ? the emissary is saying ... in a thousand years , we will turn the vastnessof space red for no reason . there was never a purpose to this war we made . but ... remembrance day has taught me anything , under strict order of the sheriff ' s secret police , it is that war is a purpose unto itself . um , the emissary is asking me to ... end the conflict . but ... i'msorry , emissary , i – i – i do not have the power to end the bloodspace war . after all the blood that has been spilled in space , oreille spilled , or ... maybe spilled at some theoretical point in the future , i – i ' m just humble radio host . and you are a sentiment nothingness inhibiting the suit of a dead cosmonaut.how could the two of us hope to stop a war ? i do not know ! just do not know . the emissary is gone , as though it was never here . maybe it was not . after all , this moment was only something i experienced , not something know is real . let'shear the rest of basimah ' s tape . basimah : people always say to me , ` ` you must be proud of your father going off to fight in the blood space war . '' i used to say yes to whatnot anymore . i do not care if it makes me selfish or ungrateful , my dad made the wrong choice and i want him back . wrote down the lyric all wrong . ` ` you'regoing to see , i ' m go n na run , i ' m go n na fly , i ' m go n na bring this loveback to you ... '' ah ! how did you get in my room ? what are you ? whatareyou ? ... daddy ? that you , daddy ? daddy ! daddy ! cecil : listeners , i do not know how the emissary ended up in this tapedrecording dropped off at the studio three days ago , given that the emissary was only released from its pit this morning . but then , i do not know how my favorite type of pie is made , but when order it , there it is , steaming and delicious ! i do not know how th email gets delivered , but every day , like clockwork , it does not ! id o not know how lost pets end up on the moon ! but they do . and theyhave built an extensive city up there . sherlock claims it is now 12:01. remembrance day is over . we can all return to our lives , and to forgetting that the blood space war is going on . or ... will go on . maybe . 1,000 years from now . and maybe , in 1,000 years , plus a day or two , those brave volunteers resent to fight in a war none of us understand will allow the mostdangerous idea of all into their heads : theywill turn back , and return home , to us , against all laws of time and space . paraphrasingthe half-remembered words of an ancient prophet , perhaps they willing this love back to us . or , maybe , they already have . staytuned next for events that will or will not happen in the order thatched may or may not occur . andros the present , as i am currently experiencing it , good night nightmare . good night . today'sproverb : ever wondered how a plane flies ? well , the answer is that no one knows . pilots are scared to ask . if we ask , maybe it ' ll stopworking .
WTNV|A New Sheriff in Town|15 December 2015|i fought the law , and the law won . ignored the law , and the law won . i abided by the law , and the lawton . welcome to night vale . there ' s a new sheriff in town , nightmare . the former sheriff , whose name we never knew , whose face whenever saw , and whose voice was only ever heard through a vocoder , is gone . our former sheriff was secretive , reclusive , really intoclassical music , and kleptocracy , rarely made public appearances , and , when he did , it was with a balaclava and cape . the new sheriff has a more public persona , refusing to wear the traditionalmask or cape , and actually allowing their first name to be known ( it ' s sam , by the way ) . the sheriff called a press conference this morning to announce that they are taking over the secret police , effective immediately . more on this story as it develops . but first , an editorial . it'sthe holidays , night vale . i know many of you will get to spend thistime with people you love . i know i ' ll be sharing some eggnog with dearest family : carlos , abby , janice ... others . but , let ' s not forget those people who quietly make our lives better . the postal carriers , the baristas and food serves , cab drivers , and the agents from a vague , yet menacing , government agency who sit outsider homes , night after night , recording all of our conversations and activities . think how boring a job domestic espionage must be . they are out there at all hours . do they ever get to sleep ? or spendholidays with families ? or take vacation ? who even knows ? so , the other day , swept up in the holiday spirit , i took some deliciouspfeffernuessecookies out to the windowless van across from my home , and gavethem to the agent sitting in the back . her name is monica burnwell , and she was just a lovely person . she appreciated that i recognized all the hard work she has put in the last several years surveillingme , and i thanked her for her service to our community . wead some small talk , and then i said , ` ` well , got ta get back to my dull life ! '' as i looked down at my shoes . she said , ` ` thanks , cecil . '' another i said , ` ` monica , would you like me to ... i don'tknow ... question the world government , or be more anti-war , or talkmore like a political dissonant , or something ? just to make your day a little more exciting . '' ` ` oh , that d be so fun , cecil , thanks ! '' she said . then went back inside and told my boyfriend i wanted to get a beret.either red or camouflage . tonight vale , this holiday season , think about all the people you may take for granted . you do not have to give them a gift or anything ; just a thank you , and a smile for all their hard work is enough . and , if you have any particularly juice secrets , consider brightening someagent ' s day by announcing them in a loud , clear voice to the nearesthidden microphone in your home . the new sheriff has spoken . they opened their press conference with the following statement : ` ` citizens night vale , we have a crisis on our hands , and that crisis is ... '' then the sheriff performed a ten-minute modern dance piece , set to music by steve re ich ( of course ) , that frantically yet lyrical ly conveyed disdain for the fiscal irresponsibility of current mayor danacardinal . the press corps loved the piece , especially its subtle tribute tochoreographer anne teresa de keersmaeker ' s sweeping repetition style , even though the sheriff ' s muscular , longitudinal movements obviouslyindicated heavy training in lest er norton ' s methodology . theyapplauded politely , and the sheriff continued with their speech.quote : ` ` our secret police force has been secretly requesting budget increases to help cover overtime and new equipment . maybe you did not know about , '' the sheriff said , ` ` because it , you know , secret and all . but we were requesting it , secretly . do not print that ! it ' s a secret ! '' the sheriff went on . ` ` instead , the mayor has decided to use our money to help the citizens of our unfriendly neighboring town , desertbluffs . we will not only see a rise in crime , because we have a mayor who decided to disrupt our stable economy , but we will also face black of financial ability to effectively stop this crime . ` ` will secretly undermine the mayor ' s authority , with the help of the city council and some liza rd people i know , to keep night vale'safe . ' ` ` hey ! do not report my finger-quotes around the word ‘ safe . they ' re secret ! ` ` thesis my promise to you , as your new sheriff . '' one reporter then asked , ` ` u mm , what happened to the old sheriff ? '' the new sheriff responded by painting a canvas entirely blue . more on this story , but first , an update on the trial of the century . judgesiobhan adam has brought in a computer programme named melonypennington to develop the first-ever all-a.i . jury for the trial hiram mcdaniels . attorneys have had a difficult time finding a jury peers for mcdaniels , as he is literally five-headed dragon and , outside of his family , seems to be the only one of his kind in the area . not knowing how to find actual dragonsto serve on the jury , and not willing to have a five-headed dragonunfairly buried by all humans , judge adam called for science to solve this problem . because , according to adam , science has solvedevery other problem . bottle prosecuting attorney , troy wash , and the court-appointed defenseattorney , also named troy wash , agreed that this is a fair solution , '' and artificial intelligence is probably a thing anyone with amacbook and some red bull has already mastered , like , years ago , '' they said in unison , with identical smiles and match ing haircuts . penningtonhas been working with young computer prodigy , began allay , who is an 11-year-old girl who inhabit what once was the body of a russiansailor , and also was only born three years ago . but then , thespecifics of her identity and her manifestation within time are really none of your business . wallabyis helping bennington engineer a sentiment program that can thinkexactly like six different five-headed dragons . began has had a realaffinity for computers ever since the ... uh , the incident in the school gym that one time . the other members of the jury will be humans . additions for those juryslots will be conducted wednesday at the night vale communitytheater . four of hiram ' s five heads are being brought up on charges of conspiracy and attempted murder of our mayor . the fifth head , the violet one , is being courted as a key witness by the prosecution , but they ' re having difficult time getting a private conversation with it . the trial is schedule for early next year . oh , by the way , listeners , i ran into former station inter maureen ! actually did not notice her at first , as i was listening to an album just got . it ' s a new musical about alexander hamilton , who became our nation ' s fourth president because he successfully killed former vicepresident aaron burr in a duel . anyway , the soundtrackis fantastic , and i was totally engrossed in my lip syncing andself-styled choreography when i saw maureen waving to me from down the street . i saw she was with someone , but his baseball hat was pulled down over his face , so i did not get a good look at him . maureenthen asked me for a letter stating she d completed her internship , because she needed those two credits for college . i reminded her serpent most of her internship flickering in and out of existence , so ... i could not write the letter . but , i was really excited to sees he was dating someone . then she said something about not assuming people are dating just becausethey ' re hanging out , bah bah bah , i do not even like boys , blahblah , but i kept staring at the boy in the ball cap , and i did not like him one bit . i felt like i knew him from somewhere , but could not put my finger on where . oh , well . i ' m sure it wo not come up again . told maureen it was a good thing she was not into boys , because this one seemed like bad news . ` ` really bad news , '' i whispered , and maureen groaned and rolled her eyes what i assume was agreement . then said , ` ` good seeing you ! '' and walked away . she shouted , ` ` come back ! '' and ` ` where ' s my credit letter ? '' whilewaving her fist and cussing , which is ( i guess ) how kid s today say '' goodby . '' oh , listeners ! i need to make an apology . earlier in today ' s show , mentioned giving some colonies to the agent from a vague , yet menacing , government agency , and in the process i revealed her filename as monica burnwell , and the location of her operation as in front of my home.because of this security breach , monica has apparently lost her jobs a secret agent and had to go into hiding for the rest of her life , changing her looks and identity , and never seeing her family friends again . reallysorry about that one , monica . let'shave a look at traffic . what do you say ? feetapart , toes together . right foot turned 45 degrees . no need for mathematical precision , but if you have a protractor , break it intopieces and swallow it . absorb its numbers like nutrient . bend yourknees . bend other things that allow for bending . do not forcemalleability . thatright foot , though ? what ' s it doing ? did you move your foot ? memories are not real . do you control your self ? not if you do not remember being in control.maybe we pretend to have experienced things so we do not have actually understand why they happened . yourfoot is flexing now . why ? what silent sir en ' s song calls your rightfoot ? you are sitting . you are passive , still . yourleft foot id les in the dark , complacent and obedient . outright foot serves a greater god . it flexed for its idol , all plastic and steel , and full of fire and fumes . your right foot wishes for youth pray with a clear mind , and open eyes . thighs been traffic . and now an update on the new sheriff ' s press conference . the sheriff announced that while they could not do anything about the money the mayor has already wasted on neighboring towns , the secretpolice would certainly make it clear to anyone from desert bluff who might be trying to enter night vale that they would not be wanted . the sheriff announced a plan to tag all desert bluff citizens withbright orange hats that have the word ` ` unwanted '' written in blinking l.e.d . lights across the front . as the sheriff said this , several journalists shifted uncomfortable in their seats . this is because their seats were uncomfortable , but theystill nodded excitedly about the sheriff ' s cool new idea . one journalist pointed out , though , that the orange hat thing would be an added expense , what with having to print up hats and design thel.e.d.s and all that . ` ` and this whole press conference seems to about our city ' s lack of funding for new projects , '' the journalists aid . in the tense silence that followed , the journalist added , ` ` plus , everyone from desert bluff is pretty easy to identify , what with all the blood on their she '' but then the reporter was helpful tackled and muzzled by the otherreporters who did not want to get off on the wrong foot with the new sheriff . as the great television news man edward r. murrow once said , ` ` hey , do not rock the boat , okay ? '' in the commotion , no one seemed to notice the appearance of severalstrangers , standing around the parameter of the conference room . our new station inter kareem was there , and claimed the strangers really did not appear so much as seemed to have always been there , even though he was positive they were not there at the start . theywere completely still , except for their breathing . they weredefinitely breathing . and everyone heard it . no one knew what the strangers wanted , but they were certain it wasn'tgood . remembers of the press stepped backward into the middle of the room.they waited . and from the silence came a noise . there came sudden ... oh.it ' s almost 20 past the hour , listeners . i had better get to the weather report . here you go . whereas i ? ah , a-ha . theywaited . from the silence came a noise . then there came a sudden ... ok , yeah . basically , everyone was quiet until a reporter asked the sheriff , ` ` who are these people ? will the secret police protect us ? '' the sheriff did not respond . it was quiet , save for the strangers'breathing for about three minutes . then the questions and cries came in increasing volume and pace , ` ` whoa re these people ? sheriff , why are not the moving ? what do they want ? has anyone seen my phone ? we ' re going to die ! '' et cet era . eventually the room devolved into panic , members of the press shoving to get out , but in a way that suggested that the exit was througheach other . then the sheriff raised their hand , and announced into the microphone , '' everything ' s fine . '' no one believed the sheriff , and the sheriff , knowing this , rephrasedthe statement . ` ` something are not fine , but other things are fine ! this , '' and here , the sheriff indicated the whole room , ` ` is probably fine . '' thepanicked reporter were now filled with both fear and doubt . the sheriff stood , stupefied , as a single bead of sweat rolled down theirbrow , along the nose , forming a thin wet crack across their entireface . no one breathed . except the strangers , of course , who , by the time the droplets had completed its erratic journey , were somehowseveral feet closer to the press corps – despite never havingvisibly moved an inch . everyone the room , including the sheriff , knew that death was upon them.none of them were afraid of death . they were , instead , terrified what would come immediately before , and immediately after , death . listeners , like i said earlier , our own inter kareem was part of that presscorps today . so , to the family of inter kareem , he ' s a good intern.and is doing great work . he got back from the press conference little bit ago saying he had a great time , and he also provided someexcellent reporting . according to kareem , the strangers encroached slowly on the remainingjournalists , moving without seeming to move . no one could look the strangers in the eye . they did not know what the strangers wanted of them , just that their lives were likely over . kareem said he heardsomeone crying , another person frantically chanting , and he wasting to take it all in . but then he heard a flapping of wings , like a pteranodon or a librarian.and , looking up , he saw a flash of slackness and long featheredcreatures descending from a dark sky . and the next thing he knew , he was back at the radio station , safely interning once again . kareemcalled the creatures that saved everyone ` ` angels , '' but i reminded him that there is no such thing , and according to the a.p.style guide , it is illegal to acknowledge the existence of angels , so this is what ... oh . uh , kareem is now trying to argue with me about the fluidity ofvernacular and the constant evolution of language . ugh.okay . alright , listeners , i need to deal with this . staytuned next for the real life actualization of that dream you had lasttuesday . you ' ll make a cut e couple , so congratulations ! an das always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : there are hot singles in your area , and they all died exactly 20 years ago , on night just like tonight .

'' maureen : this dog is , obviously ! he ' s a eagle ! therefore , he ' s a good boy ! this was a mistake . i ' ll talk to you later , or whatever . morewhatever than later . cecil : bye , bud dy ! oh , look at you , such a cut e dog ! i would do anything forth at little face , that tiny adorable face and those floppydumb ears ! i would do anything ! oh no , the eagle ' s leaving ! in the arms of maureen . maureen is alsoleaving . um , goodby , maureen ! it was nice of you to drop by and talk about ... oh , whatever it was you were talking about . listeners , she ' s leaving in the company of that same boy i saw her with a coupleweeks ago . the one with the baseball cap pulled low over his face ? definitely recognize him . where do i know him from ? na h , i ' m certain this wo not come up again . i would not worry about it . small update on my previous community calendar announcement . thingshave ... gone off track during a.p . auto shop teacher nick teller'spresentation on his inventions . it seems that he somehow accidentallyremoved the un secured burlap tar p from his body , and turned off the switch on the white noise machine next to him , thus foil ing the usualsafeguards against learning . incompletely audible talk covered simple life hacks he ' s developed to lower your electric bill . the first is a way of transmitting energy over great distances . to that end , he held up a lit light bulb , not visibly attached to any powersource . the power , nick said , came carelessly from a coil situated 26 miles away in the desert . hither power saving tips included setting your thermostat just a bit higher , improving the insulation in your home , and using a freeenergy generation he invented that can provide power for an entirehousehold indefinitely , on no fuel at all . the world government has made a statement , apologizing for the technicalerrors that are allowing this speech to be heard , and have released response that consists of just the words , ` ` nuh-uh ! '' drawn in redcrayon on construction paper . so , two interesting sides to consider in this story . update on the trial of the century , as four of the five heads belonging tofive-headed dragon hiram mcdaniels are tried for their role in the attempted coup against our beloved mayor . the first witness of the trial was called to the stand today . it was harrison kip , adjunct professor of archaeology at the night valecommunity college . he was once tricked by hiram ' s heads and theirco-conspirator , the careless old woman who secretly lives in yourhome , into summoning a sand golem that wreaked havoc throughout nightmare . we covered all this , of course , in our two-part report lastyear . harrison had been so ashamed of his role in the destruction that he fled intothe desert to live the life of a simple hermit , only reaching out civilization to procure the bare necessities of life . and , occasionally , get on sky pe to remote ly teach classes and hold officehours . mr.kip did his best to describe what had happened . but mainly , all thathappened is that he was tricked into raising a sand golem , so his testimony was not that interesting . the only highlight came when he was asked about his months out in the desert . he indicated that he found the desert mostly peaceful , but that he had recently seen something in the middle of the night that had disturbed him . he seemed very shook up about it , slumpingforward , and mumbling what was ( i believe ) the word ` ` appalling '' over and over . thatpart of his testimony probably did not mean anything , and probablydoes not indicate anything is going to happen . as that famous t.v.lawyer , buffy the empire slay er , always says in her big closingarguments , ` ` pastperformance is not a predict or of future results . '' nickteller ' s speech at the museum of forbidden technologies disastrously continuing to be heard by attended . and , even moredisastrously , the contents of this speech are being repeated on the radio . removed on from his energy tips to reminisce a bit about some projects of his that did not go exactly according to plan . for instance , he said he once did some work on a boat in pennsylvania , and a few mixed-up calculations meant that instead of the boat becominginvisible , as planned , it jumped through both time and paralleluniverses , horribly altering every human on board . but , nick went on to emphasize , he did not let failures like that get him down , even though that particular failure was spectacular that he had to change his name and fake his death in order to evade the consequences . wh oo ! this is inspiring stuff . even though hearing it is completelyillegal ... as is , probably , repeating it on the radio . whoopsie ! well , more from nick as i continue to ` ` accidentally '' tell you what essaying . but first , today ' s traffic . spectrum of gray . the top-most gray is that of sunlight , filteredthrough high-altitude clouds . then , through lower-altitude haze , darkening down on a monochromatic spectrum toward dirt that is gray ... or , appearsgray due to the quality of light . built from the dirt are gray buildings , full of gray people speakinggrayly . ` ` yes , i ' ll have another slice of pie , '' they say . ` ` business looking as good as this pie , '' they say . ` ` pie tastes great , and is better , nutritionally , than most people think , '' they say . colourless , toneless words . gray faces slack ing onto gray necks and gray bodies , gray dreams of a gray future that is neither good nor bad , but justwhat ' s next . a gray life , lived gray ly . gray dreams through graynights , electric lights too bright to ever let dark settle into dark , no great absence to contrast the stars , no rich black of the void , gray night . gray dreams . gray life . gray words . gray buildings in gray world and the light grays gray ly through the gray . thighs been traffic . and now , a word from our sponsors : today'ssponsor is google . looking for pictures of a monkey riding a pony ? just search that on google and it will probably be there . looking for pictures of a dog named table ? search that , and i bet someone namedtheir dog table and took a picture . how about an image of the exact moment of your death ? i do not know , thatmight be on there too . give it a search ! the internet is huge . whatever it is , it ' s probably on there . google.search for super-weird stuff . you ' ll probably find something at leastkind of similar . thighs been a word from our sponsors . well , it ' s almost time for our weather report , and i have to admit , i'msurprised . i d have thought , given some of the forbidden information ' ve been repeating from nick teller that we would have been shutdown by now . but maybe i was wrong ab – wrongab– wrongabout– wrongab– –boutthat– shutdown by now wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong g-g-g-g-g-g-gggggggggggggggggggg i'mfinally back , listeners . i'msure you ' ve noticed , over the past several days , that our usualbroadcasts had been replaced by harsh buzzing and the occasionalshout of ` ` you ' re not hearing anything right now , this is not sound ! '' as had kind of hoped , the world government shut down our station . whichmeant that i got a couple weeks off . had been needing a break , and the extra-legal closure of my place of work , and the forced re education of all of us who work there , gave me just the chance i needed . between re education sessions , i did a number of household ch ores thatneeded doing . painting , gutter cleaning , and the like . the picking , and the putting down , and the mending , and the clearing.re-sodding my lawn after michelle burned her statement into it . i handsome quiet time with carlos , and i re-watched the entire series fluffy the empire slay er . uh ! i just love at the end of everyepisode , after she successfully wins the big court case , when she smokes cigars and cracks wise with her law firm partner , angel . ugh ! so good . also dropped in on nick teller at his auto shop in the high school.he had just finished up feeding the cars and was grading some papers , but he kindly made time for a chat . i asked him if he wished things had turned out for him differently , if he wished that he had not had to flee his old life and come to this town where his best inventions are suppressed by order of the world government . smiled . ` ` no , '' he said . ` ` honestly , i get it . the world has never been accepting what i do , and i ' m happy with my life here . i like teaching autoshop , i like working with young people , i like guiding them into ali fe of creating new things that will never see the light of day because they threaten the system as it is and the powers as they credit ' s rewarding work . '' told him i was glad that he seemed to have found peace in his life.he said he was , too . ` ` after all , '' he said , ` ` what other choice would i have ? it ' s not like i can go back and fix my mistakes . or ... wait . '' returned pensively and told me that he had some old papers he wanted to look through for purely nostalgicreasons , and asked if i could leave him to it . and so i did . listeners , maybe at some point nick wanted to be something other than he was , but that does not mean he is behold to that dream he once had . it'sokay for him to be all right with who he is now . acceptance is not failure . sometimes acceptance is just acceptance . of course , one must always be open to new dreams , and new ambition . and if , at some point , nick decides that he no longer wants to be an a.p.auto shop teacher , or if he decides he wants to alter history so he will never have even come here ... then that , too , will be okay . staytuned next for an unexpected gain in cabin pressure . no mask wilhelm you . we were not prepared for things to go this way . andgoodnight , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : you know whatwould be great ? if someone finally made a movie showing spider-man'sorigin story . i d love to finally see that on the big screen .

'' they sneered lovingly . ` ` we think it is the kindestthing in the sky ! look ! '' the city council then pointed up at thewindowless conference room ' s dropped ceiling . well , it ' s so nice to hear the city council in a good mood ! i ca not think of the last time they ' ve sounded so hopeful and cheery . have theyever been in a goodmood ? button know , everyone here at the station , too , has beenuncharacteristically friendly the past few days . station management , who ... i only ever see as shadows and glowing orange lights in the corner office , and who regularly scream and – and cause the building to shake when the ad sales team does not make quarterly goals ... hasten buying donets for the staff . they also bought us a new clawhammer and a stone pound ing board for making coffee . plus , this morning , they left a card on my desk thanking me . yeah ! stationmanagement , thanking me , and giving me a raise ! i did not even know i was getting paid ! oo f ! well , so many people having a lovely day , i hope you ' re having one too , night vale . our new sheriff followed up the city council press conference with report on the growing number of strangers in night vale . thesestrangers appear out of nowhere , and do not visibly move , other thantheir even , deliberate breaths . sometimes they are suddenly closer , without anyone seeing them take a step . the sheriff said they think the strangers are just people from desertbluffs , who have abandoned their wretched city to come live in nightmare , but that the secret police are looking further into rumors that the strangers might be something else entirely . whenpressed about their opposition to mayor dana cardinal ' s financialassistance of desert bluff , the sheriff brought out a severalfoot-high stone and sculptor an intricate series of interconnectedgeometrical shapes , each one balancing the next . the reporterswatched the sheriff for hours , until the sculpture was complete . the sheriff then added that they do not oppose the mayor on all issues . ` ` in fact , mayor cardinal is a goodmayor . we just disagree on the issue of how to fight crime , '' the sheriff said , still tightly gripping their stone car ver . ` ` for instance , i agree with the mayor about needing to open the dog park to dogs and people ! love dogs ! i think it would be great if folks could take their dogsinto the dog park . '' the sheriff then said that they saw the cut est eagle puppy the other day . really , reallycute ! the sheriff leaned close into the mi c and said , ` ` such good boy ! gooooood doooooooooooooooog ! '' listeners , um , i ' m getting word that the city council was just seen in public , walking across the front lawn of city hall , each of them carryingmatching black cases . witnesses were stunned , as the city council is rarely seen outside of city hall – despite their constantvacations . somereported that they heard the council whistling maria carey ' s ` ` always my baby , '' but others reported that that must have been thebluebirds fluttering around just above their heads . someeyewitness accounts said that the council was not even walking , theywere ` ` strolling . '' when has the city council ever strolled ? we did not know their bodies were even anatomical capable of that ! someoneelse said , ` ` well that looks like skippingto me . '' but that ' s just ridiculous . skipping ? is the city councilleaving town on another vacation ? what put them in such a good mood ? more on this as it develops . and now , a word from our sponsor . here with that is deb , a sentiment patch of haze ... and also , i think , our ad sales manager here at hesitation . deb : oh , i do not work for the station . cecil : but you regularly provide me with copy for our live spots . oh , andy ou also read ad s from various companies on the air . do you work fo ran ad agency ? deb : cecil , please . cecil : but this is my show . if you do not actually work at the station , or for the companies you ' re pitching , i d kind of like to know who you work for . deb : shah . not everything can be an emergency . okay , then . humanlisteners , today ' s show is brought to you by pfizer . what does pfizerdo ?

you ca not . you would not . no , you you absolutelywould not . you would not dare describe what we do . you'restill trying to describe us in your mind , are not you ? maybe pfizerwas not articulate enough . maybe pfizer ca not trust you . you havebetrayed pfizer . do not say no . did you just say no ? why are you always arguing with us ! ? ! we give , and give , and give , and whenever ask for anything other than money in return . we only ask for money , and that you try not to describe us in words ! and what do you do ?

this is still your work time , kar– oh.he just skated away . i need to sit him down and talk to him aboutprofessionalism . and where he got cool states like those . they had lightning bolts on ‘ em . but first , we ' ve just received a call from a controversial figure.calling in from the jailhouse ( i presume ) , while on trial . listeners , let ' s go now to an exclusive interview with literal five-headeddragon hiram mcdaniels . hello , hiram . hiram ' s gold head : rowdy , cecil . uh , thanks for letting me on your show . i just , uh , wanted to call in and ... know , clear up a few things about thistrial . hiram ' s green head : we will burn the courthouse to the ground ! we will ch ar the already charred remains of the human judge and jury ! cecil : my understanding is that the jury is not all human . it ' s a jury of peers , hiram . hiram ' s goldhead : well , now , uh , my greenhead is speaking metaphorically . hiram ' s greenhead : we will scotch the scales of justice ! hiram ' s goldhead : yeah , like that . the thing is , cecil , uh , they are using computers to simulate five-headeddragons on the jury , but now they ' re saying that a single five-headeddragon computer program counts as five separate jurors . so they'reonly making one computer and then choosing seven human jury members.that hardly seems fair . hiram ' s grayhead : they do not respect us at all . hiram ' s goldhead : no , no they do not , grayhead . they really do not . plus , no computer can re create the complexities of sentiment dragons . hiram ' s grayhead : it ' s offensive . cecil : well , i know they looked for actualfive-headed dragons , but there are not many out there that the city can find . hiram ' s gold head : well , my sister hadassah is in town . i think she should reconsidered . cecil : family members of the accused generally are not allowed on furies . but also , one of your heads , the violet one , is going to be a witnessagainst you at the trial . uh , how are things going within your nobody ? hiram ' s goldhead : they ' ve put a hole in my cell wall so my violet head can be outside of the jail , since , uh , he is not charged with any crime . hiram'sviolet head : i can hear you conspiring against me ! hiram ' s greenhead : quiet , you traitorous stink ! i will chew you from hiram ' s goldhead : hey , easy , green . you'renot allowed to talk to violet anymore . it would be witness tampering . hiram ' s blushed : we should not even talking to the media . our lawyer said anything we say can be used in the trial . hiram ' s goldhead : my blue head is right , cecil . i just wanted to use my phone call to get the word out about the unfair practices going on in this trial . hiram ' s grayhead : it is so unfair . cecil : well , i ' ll certainly look into this . uh , are you having an okay day otherwise , hiram ? hiram ' s goldhead : i sure am , cecil . eh , despite my circumstances , everyone ' s in pretty good spirits today.they , uh , served raw lamb in the mess hall and they let us watch whole hour of the lee margin marathon on the c-span this afternoon . hiram ' s greenhead : theyshowed deathhunt ! it was his finest work as an actor ! hiram ' s grayhead : i think gorkypark was one of his more interesting roles . but yeah ... death hunts pretty good . hiram ' s blushed : lee margin is a lighthousein a stormy cinema tic sea . hiram'sviolet head : i personally prefercatballou ! hiram ' s greenhead : silence , you withered new t ! hiram ' s goldhead : all right there , green . hey , uh , thanks for taking my call , cecil . cecil : no , thank you , hiram . we'regetting good news from teddy williams down at the new skating rinkthat there are record crowds . so many people are showing up to skate.he did not realize how popular roller skating would be here . we'realso getting bad news from teddy that all of the lights have gone out . he ' s hearing deep grows coming from not only the ghost pets in the walls , but loud shouts and snarl coming from the skatersthemselves . he can not see who it is , but he can definitely smell the metallic bring stench of blood . he did not care to elaborate about how he is so familiar with the smell of blood , just that he ' s sort of an expert in the matter and it'sdefinitely blood , and that no one else should come to the skating r ink . whispered all of this from underneath the turntable of the dj booth . reported seeing looming shadows in the near-black , the shadows ofhulking figures with what appeared to be either antlers or veryelaborate hats . he could feel the floor trembling beneath him , as there were a stampede of beasts or a clash of angry gods . williamsreported that he just once – just one time in his life ! – wants people to be able to play arcade games and state and bow land drink so das without fearing for their safety . listeners , do not go to the skating r ink . and for those of you already there , takeover ! do not come out from yourhiding place ! not even if they put on patbenatar ! as i wait for further news from inter kareem at the skating r ink , let me take you now to the weather . despitehaving a terrifying start , the new skating r ink sounds like a hugesuccess , and everyone seems to be having fun again . it is clear now what has happened . internkareem said that when he arrived at the skating r ink , he saw almosteveryone from night vale . leann hart from the daily journal , johnpeters ( you know , the farmer ? ) , old woman josie , and the beingskareem insists on calling angels . judge siobhan adam , even the citycouncil was there ! their black cases were all opened , revealing whiteretro states with thick red and blue piping . twas a feel-good atmosphere on a feel-good day . kareembought a soda , filled it with every flavor from the fountain , and put his bag in a lock er . ` ` electriclady '' by panelled monáe was on and he raced to the floor to have his first state to his favorite song , only to see a group ofhulking figures with elaborate hats enter . kareem stopped dead in his tracks , standing and shivering in front of this menacing group . kareemhad never seen them before , but he recognized them immediately by their sound and their smell as the management of this radio station . kareemstiffened up and prepared an explanation , that he was here to work , uh , to report on the new skating r ink , and – and that he was notslacking . but station management did not seem to notice him . theywere gazing across the room at the city council who , by this point , had all donned short shorts and headbands , and were twirling and spinning in unison around the r ink . just as beyond ' s ` ` to '' started playing , the city council and station management all made eye contact . station management and city council skated toward eachother , and everything went dark . the record player scratched , and all went quiet ... save for horrify ing grows and animal stretching . kareemcould smell something bring and metallic , like lives . whileeveryone scrambled to hide in fear , kareem – himself a young man in a new relationship – knew exactly what was going on . he put on the night vision goggles we require every one of our interns to carry at all times , and he watched as station management and the city council met in the middle of the r ink , joining arms , skating in slow happycircles , intermittently placing heads on shoulders , wanting to sneakkisses , but uncertain of the right moments , dozens of figures withhundreds of fingers all intertwined in defiance of our understanding of physicaldimension , sighing hotly with romantic need and burning anticipation . the city council had brought live rodent , and they held them up gingerlyto station management ' s mouths , as management chewed off pieces of the screaming creatures . when station management finished devouring the last bites , the city council adorable brushed pieces of tail handful from station management ' s face , letting their fingertips ( or ... whatever it is at the end of whatever those appendages are ) linger . after few circles around the r ink , management and the council lefttogether . theaftermath of their budding romance is clear among the brand new polished hardihood floor of the skating r ink , swirling hearts strungtogether , carved into the wood with their wheels . the lights are back on now . everyone is skating again . the sterno blasting parliament ' s ` ` flashlight '' with hansom ' s ` ` mmmbop '' coming up next . as a person in a long-term relationship , i know how fulfilling long love can be . i also remember the days of being single , and that is alsofulfilling . but nothing is quite so thrilling , so unexpected and uncertain , as that moment in between those two states – single dandin love . that short fire burst of irrational passion for person ... or people ... or multidimensional entities you barely know but with whom you maybe want to be with always ? you know the thrill of hopeless wanting , where you long to hold the others tightly as to become one . you think it is love , even when it is not . love is patient , and understanding , and turbulent , androck-like , ever confident in itself . but this early infatuations , these additions to a new other , are some of life ' s most fragile and ecstatic moments . well ... iso happy for city council and station management . they make acute ... couple . kareemsaid that he also saw former inter maureen , her new puppy , and some boy in a hoodie all brooding in the corner . maureen appeared be making sardonic jokes at the expense of the new couple , and at the expense of the idea of dating itself . kareemsaid the dog was really cut e , but there was something about the sight of maureen and the hooded boy and the puppy that upset him . i toldkareem , ` ` no , she ' s always like that . '' staytuned next for the best hits of the 50 s , 60 s , 70 s , 80 s , 90 s , 2000s,2010s , 2020s , and beyond . an das always , good night night vale . good night . today'sproverb : be careful what you wish for because it probably wo not comet rue , and life is mostly about expectation management .

'' ` ` no , sam , '' she said . ` ` you wo not . you wo not because it ' s theirtown too , now . you wo not because there ' s nowhere else they should go.you wo not because it ' s a bad thing to do and i think , somewhere in there , you are not a bad person . maybe i ' m wrong about that , wouldn'tbe the first time . but primarily , you wo not , '' she concluded , '' because i wo not let you . '' andre folded her arms , and she said nothing more . the secret police still held their potato sacks , un sure now of what theyshould do . their sheriff no longer ordered , or even goaded , but juststared thoughtfully at their mayor . reformer citizens of desert bluff stopped fleeing , looking back at this first pigment of hope . another the sheriff got in their car , turned it around , and drove away.the secret police all got in their cars and followed . the citycouncil roared and stopped but , without the police to back them up , they too eventually retreated . standstill dana stood , silent , arms folded , until the last of them was gone . she turned to the new citizens of night vale who had , momentsbefore , been fleeing . ` ` hi , '' she said . ` ` i ' m dana . do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any problems , okay ? '' she got back in her car . she , too , left . i ... uh ... i–i– i do not know where i stand on this scene , as it just unfolded . ineed to think about it . while i think about it , let ' s go to the weather . here'swhat . we all have our regionalisms . for instance , in many parts of the country , there is a sandwich , known as a sub sandwich , that is another places known as a hero , a hoagie , a grinder , a longburger , prince ' s delight , or a bread burri to . thesis one example of a difference in culture . there are others . it is in these little details that we see ourselves , that we define howe are not others , canthus how we are ourselves . whenconfronted with someone whose ` ` normal '' is not our '' normal , '' we are forced to confront the most frightening prospect of all : that there is no such things ` ` normal . '' just the accidental cultural moment we happened to be born into , a cultural happenstance that never existed before , and will never exist again . our idea of ` ` normal '' is a city built on sand . for instance , for us , our city is literally built on sand and this is our ` ` normal . '' we resist difference because it requires we acknowledge that the culture we grew up with as ` ` normal '' is just a momentary accident . requires we accept that the world we were born into will never be the same as the world we die in . the longer we live , the more we becomeinterlopers , even in our home towns . but , if we d let it happen , also , the more we will learn . i ... cannot say i am always happy about desert bluff . it can be said that i haveranted about them on the radio , sometimes for hours , while listenerscalled in to complain that they wanted me to talk about something ( anything ! ) else . have thrown things at the microphone , and attempted to cast spellsupon desert bluff that would drive them into ruin . but my happiness , or unhappiness , is ... irrelevant to their existence.they exist . and so do i. and now our differing ` ` normal , '' in suchclose proximity , perhaps will edge just slightlytoward each other . nightmare may never again be the night vale i knew , but it will be somekind of night vale . it will be a version of our town that someday , someone will look back on and think , ` ` those were the days ! that was what was normal !

dove.lungs on a white table . littleleague coach lucia tereschenko told me the incredible story of her journey to night vale . whence was a young woman , she left her home to travel west acrossamerica . she wanted to find a new life for herself , out of the crowded smoke-choked cities . she walked for miles , picking up work roadside towns . she rode in carriages when she had money , and she eventually found a job making belts for an old manner who workedlucia long hours for little pay . the old manner was otherwise kind , and treated lucia like her very own daughter , because she never had a family . but the manner grew ill , and lucia took care of her , bathing her and fetching herb mixturesfrom the apothecary . one morning the old woman was no more . lucia ran her business for a whilelonger , but since the manner had no heirs , and lucia did not feel she had found her true home , she continued west , where there was supposedly golden sunshine along an azure sea . soon , however , she once again was in desperate need of money so that should eat , and could sleep in safety . she met some men . silent men.men who kept their faces in shadows , who kept their voices shadows , who kept their guns in shadows . and she worked for them , never knowing what her job was – just that she was to ride the train with them until the time was right . one afternoon , the men stood up simultaneously and moved in differentdirections : one to the front of the train , one to the rear . one climbed through the ceiling onto the roof of the car . two more drewpistols on the passengers . they told lucia to keep everyone calm . the train whined to a halt , and the men hurriedly unloaded crates frothy rear car onto a horse-drawn cart . the crates were warm , warmerthan the air around them . they smelled sharp and earthy , like freshlyground cinnamon . the apparent sheriff of the little town the stopped in , the town of nightmare , a place she d never heard of , soon arrived . he was wearing awelding mask and a cowboy hat . the sheriff drew his gun on the shadowy men but , being out numbered , he was unable to do much to stopthem . so , while calming the others on the train , lucia crept behind one of them en . he had a kerchief drawn across is face ( not an actual kerchieftied in front of his face , but a simulacrum of pattered fabrichand-drawn on his face ) . using one of her leather belts , luciawhipped the gun out of his hand and deftly picked it up from the ground . she fired at the outlaws , felling both . outside , the sheriff fell ed two more . but , as she climbed up the top of the car , she heard a shot from justbelow her . and then she was lying on her back . she could not remember why she had laid down . she saw , in the sky just above her , a darkplanet of awe some size , lit by no sun . she did not know how she had not noticed it before . it was so close.an invisible tit an , all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep turbulent ocean . another ... well , let me take you first to the weather . asked lucia if that ' s how she died . ` ` well , one moment i ' m in a sunlight , '' she said , ` ` and the next moment i'ma ghost . '' sheathed if i had a cigarette . i do not smoke , so i sad no . ` ` me h , i could not hold it anyway , '' she admitted . ` ` why are you living in a baseball diamond , '' i asked her . she said this was not always a baseball diamond , it was just a field . afield where train tracks used to run . a field where a train oncerolled to a stop . but , right around this time the game of baseball was becoming popular , andkids began coming to the filed to play . lucia watched , and learned , and grew to love the sport ' s simplicity and structured grace . ` ` its beautiful game , cecil ! so i started trying to coach the kid s , but since i ' m translucent and hay , they got scared and ran away , callingthis the haunted baseball diamond . ' over time , the kid s realized had some helpful things to say about batting stance , and hitting thecutoff man , so they came back . '' luciaturned to one of the kid s . ` ` eye on the ball , man ny ! '' she shouted . asked lucia , ` ` so , you think those men on the train were related these strangers in night vale now ? '' ` ` you do not see evil like that very often , '' she said . ` ` but no . horsemen on the train performed their evil because they needed whatever was in those crates more than they needed life , or peace , '' she said . ` ` these strangers ? they do not needanything . they are evil , for evil ' s own sake . '' looked over and saw steve and janice coming my way . they were highfiving and grinning . luciasaid , ` ` she ' s a good kid , good arm . she ' s going to be a greatshortstop like her uncle ! '' told lucia i hope we have a good baseball season , and it was wonderful catching up with her . steve , janice , and i turned to walkback to steve ' s van . luciawhispered to me , ` ` we ' re past time for hope , cecil . they ' re longer coming . they ' re here.and we can not stop something that wants nothing . '' staringstraight at janice , ignoring lucia , i said , ` ` you made the team ! congress ! let ' s get ice cream ! '' behind , i heard a distant bark . it was a sweet , sickening yelp . and in the reflection on the van window , i could see a boy in a hoodie , holding a eagle puppy , and both of them were looking at us . felt cold sweat , but my face was hot . my tongue was sticky and thick . ` ` steve , can we get a dog ? '' janice said , all strapped in . ` ` let'sget that ice cream , okay ? '' i interrupted . the dog barked again , and i did not look . i did not look at anything as got in my seat and shut the door . i felt like throwing up . ` ` thanks for driving , steve , '' i said , putting my hand softly on his arm . he looked momentarily amused . no , not amused . concerned . and we droveaway as janice told us all about her new team . staytuned next for something lurking just outside your window . don'tworry , it ' s not a human . an das always , good night , night vale . good night . today'sproverb : dance like the government is watching .

'' that was me . i did that . well , i did not kill the reaches , that was the exterminator you called . he was , very thorough this job . but i wrote the note , chad . that note was me . wead a good way about us . i lived secretly and carelessly in yourhome , and you ... well , you kind of did , too . only , metaphorically . but then one night you did not return home . isa w in your e mails ( i loved reading your e mails , chad , socompellingly bland ) you had to go check out a used and discountsporting goods store . something for your work . but that store was not what it claimed to be , and you did not return home for months . the landlord came by in your long absence , but i scared her off with thisterrifying noise i can make using only a leather belt and a bird . you left your home , and i protected it for you . but when you returned , things were different . oh , how different ! yourcrisp button shirts all unbuttoned and wrinkled , dangling on hookslike dried pelts from a disguised hunt . tuesdays you rarely notice the little things i do . like when i painted the inside of your bathtubs black , or glued flurry photo of spidersinto the bottom of your mug s . you do not even play video gamesanymore . you wear hoods and light candles . you drew a star in the middle of your floor , which ... actually , i can totally get behind . youremails , which were once so wonderfully calm and full of mailinglists , and then social invitations , and social invitation rejections , and food delivery receipts , the tale of a stagnant nothing of a man , so perfectly movable in his come inertia ... now they are terse , codedmessages to a girl i think you are destroying . ` ` found door . come over , '' this one says . ` ` he is here , and he is good , '' this one says . ` ` candles are growing again , '' this one says . i do not like these candles you have that grow when lit , and melt whatnot . and i certainly do not like him . whatnot brought to us here in this little town , my town , the town i secretly live in , what you summoned ... i stoppedsecretly living in your house because i was afraid of it . but now have returned because i feel – unusual for me – some obligation to do something , to prevent this coming disaster . listen to me . it is five in the morning and you are asleep , but i am at you rear quietly asking you – telling you – i ' m begging you really , chad . did you ever think that i would beg you ? beg anyone ? have not begged since i was a child aboard that wicked ship . those mended not listen either , chad , which is the reason i lived at the bottom of the ocean for so many years before this place , this desert , thistown , this apartment ... chad , what happened to you in that store that was not a store ? what did theyturn you into ? what have you brought into this reality ? do you evenknow the destruction that awaits this town ? not just this town , perhaps the world ? that is not a door you have opened , chad . when is a door not a door ? when it is a chasm . know you can not see or hear me , for i live secretly , but i beg you.if somehow my voice seeps into your dreams and sticks in your memory , you must undo what you have done , before it is too late . you must chad ? that creature , that monster you summoned is here . it is staring at me with eyes that could never be mistaken for human . it ' s walking toward me . how does it see me , chad ? no one sees me ! chad ?

and she needed something that wouldrelax her . suggested easy listening , like slay er or some silence , but she said she was tired of all the top 40 stations playing no sound at all.silence is too mainstream , and she wanted something new . i'llbe honest , i actually like silence . i should not ; it ' s , like , so popular , but my favorite silence is the hum of a dwyer from the nextfloor down . i also like the swish of a highway that you thought wast oo far away to hear , but now that it ' s so quiet you can hear it , distant and dissipating . like , the sizzle of foam on a wave . gave maureen leonard cohens ' s new album , the one where he talks in gravely voice and women sing along behind him . she rolled her eye sand walked out . i think she liked it . hold on . welcome to dark owl records . hey , larry . oh you want the new album by thebeatles ?

'' it ' s like , get in line , you know ? get in that line . the one leading to the cashregister . i ' ll ring you up when it ' s your turn . bu ti ' ve let the temporary staff dissolve back into mud for the season , and i wo not have to mutter the indentations to bring them back to life for another month or two . it ' s just me , behind the counter . me , like always . small i need . i ' m the ultimate underground hit . no one ' s heard of me.no one ' s listening . just the way i like it . yes , i know this is a one story building , larry ! i was being metaphorically do not actually have any beetles albums . it ' s like the old joke : listen to ba ch often , but ... he left . his loss . maureencame by . steady , jaw tight , hair loose , hands swinging , shuffling , re starting , sighing maureen . she said she liked leonard ' s album , but she had heard it enough now . what else did i have ? never thought i d do this , but i gave her some of my favoriterecordings of bees . i lovethose recording ! but i ' ve listened to them enough times now that id o not ever need to hear them again . it ' s like , the sound became part of me , and i know it better than the recording do , you know ? hm m , maybe you do not know . probably not . you ' re probably still listening that wood guthrie single on repeat , because you just listen whatever ` ` big music '' tells you too . oh , this is my favorite part of the hop core recording . it ' s the partwhere the thumb of my hopping gets so quiet that it is not any sound at all . it ' s a silence . and you have to know i ' m there to recognize me in the silence . that i ' m still hopping , even though you ca not hear it . listen : that'sme in there , in that no sound at all . they say music is made up of the spaces between the notes , and that life is made up of the momentswhen your eyes are close because you ' re blinking . and that books are made up of blank pages that everyone pretends have words on them so they ' ll seem smart . i'mthe blank . and the space . i ' m the pause . i ' m the gap . hold on , i have a customer . id o not actually have a customer ; i just need a moment to myself . thesis me , greeting someone . this is them , feeling like just becausethey ' re in a record shop they ' re entitled to , like , music , whatever . ugh , that person is the worst ! hold on , someone is actually coming in . oh ! it ' s ... ill i ' ll be back . maureencame by . satisfied , jaw loose , hair up , hands idling , striding , stopping , re starting , sighing maureen . she said she loved the beesrecording . she wanted something like it , but even more so . similar , but so different that it would startle her . knew exactly what she meant with that thirst , but i did not know how to satisfy it . there ' s only so much music , you know ? and there ' s so much human desire . well , you are not going to believe this . probably , like , you wo not evenunderstand . i gave her the recording of me hopping . i know that , like , ruins it because now someone else has listened to it , but somehow i do not mind if maureen hears it . i think , maybe even i likethat . i hope she comes back soon . mean , do not get me wrong . i love it when the record store is empty , when there are none of thoseannoying customers clamor ing for music to listen to . being alone is the best . bu ti also kind of like it when maureen comes by . her being here is cool too , i guess . just have to figure out what album to show her next . only , there ' s so much good music , you know ? cecil : each leads to the next . the seasons are a corridor we perceivethrough , and the door at the end of the corridor is black anddepthless . appreciate the warmth of this narrow corridor . how small this world is ! and how small we all are for living in it . anyhow joyful a smallness can be . so let us return , for one last time , for one last small time , to the april monologue . stevecarlsberg : i try to be helpful . i know i ca not always fix everything , i know limits ( and they are many ) , but still ... i try to be helpful . so when the kid came by , i did my best . he was scared , sure , because he could see them too . the glowing arrows the sky . dotted lines and arrows and circles ... see , the sky is chart that explains the entire world , and he could see it ! that ' s terrifying thing if you are not prepared for it . oh , he was shaking so bad . his ball cap was pulled low over his face . ` ` steve ! ` ` he said . ` ` steve carlsberg ! i know you can see them too . help me ! '' an di tried . i ... i – i tried to be helpful . like the evenings , when it ' s quiet . in parts of the world , the big cities , things do not change much from morning to afternoon evening . the same even light , the same people in a hurry . but here , every time of day has a different tone and shade . in the mornings , before anyone else is up , the desert is golden , and the horizon light illuminated every detail on the mountains to the west . feel bad for the folks who do not believe in mountains , who wo not see , even when shown . then the birds come and hop around outside the kitchen window . oh , i like to watch them as i make coffee . my brother-in-law , he never sees the birds on account of he likes to grind the coffee himself , and thepounding of his coffee hammer keeps all the birds away . but me ? id o not mind the pre-hammered stuff . it ' s a soft trade for the birds . another the afternoon , when the light deepens and widen , and the mountains turn to blue cutlets against a white-blue sky ! another the sunset , loud and fragrant , like sunset usually are . another the evening , a vast , quiet empty . just me and abbey and janice , floating , and island of a family in the rich darkness of the desertnothing . the kid was so scared ! oh , boy . but he had it in him . he tries to be helpful too , i can tell ! and so it was not enough to know . he wanted to do somethingabout it . he said that he d been sent to a sporting goods store that they thoughtmight have been a front for the world government . i know that place.the world government is not the half of it ! go in that sporting goodsstore , you ' re go n na find a realracket ! ha-ha-ha-ha ! i love puns ! but yeah , that place holds the core of it . and this kid , he goes in there and he sees it ! and once you ' ve seen it , once you know , you ca not ever not know.you ca not become who you once were after you ' ve become what you are now . glowingarrows in the sky , dotted lines . he understood , like i understand . the folks that run night vale , they think they have control . but you ca not control what a person knows ! the more you think you have thatcontained , the more it exudes you . you might as well try to control the weather . another try to do that , too , using cloud seed ing , drones , and laserarrays . but it never works out the way they planned . ` ` whitman we do about it ?

WTNV|Standing and Breathing|15 April 2016|i believe the children are our future . they are also our past and our present . this is how childrenwork in linear time . welcome to night vale . mayor dana cardinal announced thatlast night ' s air raid sirens were nothing to be alarmed by . nor are the missing street and highway signs , nor are the angry people who were assigned to hold the signs and wave them about , using the maritime telegraph language of seashore , and who are now standingaround dumbfounded and empty-handed . nor should we yet concernourselves with mailboxes , which have all been filled with what postalworkers hope is just haired . following meeting with the sheriff and the city council , mayor cardinal says she believes this all to be the work of pranksters – perhaps the return of the fera dogs , who once de faced several concrete wallswith librarian street art – but the mayor and the secret police are not ruling out more sinister activity . sheriff sam added , while whistling a piece of balsam into a polar bear , that it ' s ` ` definitely these foreigners , moving here from desert bluff . '' the city council said nothing . they mostly stood around behind the pressconference podium testing and giggling . all of them had freshhaircuts , crisp unturned po lo collars , and manures . the mayor said she would work closely with sheriff sam to find the culprits , but in the meantime , there ' s no need for alarm . sam added that there was a need to remove all the foreigners . more on this story as it develops . but first , an update on the trial of hiram mcdaniels . unable to find jury of peers for a literal five-headed dragon , the court agreed to create artificial intelligence to simulate what five-headed dragonpeers would be like , and then place that a.i . on the jury . for thisproject , they hired expert computer programme melony bennington , who joins us now by phone . welcome to my show , melony ! melony : welcome to your show ! i mean hi , hello . it turns out you welcomed me , it does not make sense to welcome you . sorry , my mind was , you know , the expanse . the vast . the out there . i mean my mind is elsewhere . my mind is everywhere . cecil : wonderful ! and how are you – melony : do you ever look at the stars ? the stars . you know , the stars . no teach star , but some of the stars . i mean every single one of the stars at once . i mean the whole night sky added up . do you ever look at the sum of the stars ? the night sky , as an equation ? beauty as a ma th problem ? which it is – everything beautiful is ma th . everything beautiful is a problem . what was your question ? cecil : u mm , how are you doing ? melony : oh . i ' m fine . cecil : melony , you sound familiar . melony : do i sound familiar ? you just said that , so i guess i do . you gustave met one of my programs ... or not met , none of them are sentiment . you ca not meet things that have nosentience . well , i guess you could be like , ` ` hi there , pile frocks , i ' m melony , '' just to see what happens . i suppose there is no set dogma for social engagement . oh , i wish i had a dog . have you ever met a rock ? what'syour name again ? cecil : well , mmm ... i'm– melony : what i ' m saying is that i probably sound familiar because all of programs have the same voice as me . that ' s how computer programmingworks . cecil : have you ever programme a computer that broadcast on a radiostation , specifically one that recites random numbers ? melony : oh , yes ! the local numbers station , wzzz . yes , that was one of yearly programs . and those numbers and chimes are not random , they'reencoded messages to foreign spies . also a few pudding recipe and funny cryptology poem or two . cecil : so you designed fey , the voice of wzzz ! melony : oh , the wzzz program has no name , and absolutely no sentence . not every program is sentiment . that wzzz program only recites numbers acetones . that ' s all it does , and all it ever will do . it does not know it exists . cecil : about that ... see , there was thing that happened a couple years ago ... melony : ugh , listen to me bubbling on . you had me on to talk about the trial . cecil : yes . well , i understand there has been some controversy around the ethics of making a jury of peers from artificial intelligence , ratherthan actual five-headed dragons . melony : oh , there are a lot more problems than just ethics . what are ethics , even ? how can you quantity what is right ? i mean , let'sassign a number on how ethical a computerized jury is . cecil : i ' m go n na say it ' s a low number , like 1.5 or 2. melony : but let ' s make it on a scale of 0 to 3. so that ' s pretty good ! everything ' s going fine ! ethical ly speaking , anyway . but the programming has been tough . have you ever even tried program a computer ? cecil : i barely know how to turn one on . say , as long as i have a realcomputer expert on , do you have some basic computer tips for me and our listeners ? melony : oh ! a public service like that would be reallyethical , like a 2.5 or even a 3 on the ethicability scale . what good idea ! here are some basic tips for the computer novice who'shoping to one day write code that advances us closer to the singularity . tip 1 : computers can make you angry . anything can make you angry.computers are anything . tip 2 : is your computer plugged in ? that'sprobably illegal . you need a license to plug in a computer . tip 3 : computer programs are a lot like humans . they ' re full of bug s – mostlytheoretical , and invented by overlay caffeinated lonely people in darkrooms . tip 4 : did i say that thing about the stars already ? cecil : yes , i ... melony : oh , good ! tip 5 : create a strong password . the most secure password possible is ( you ' ll never guess this ! ) where the o is replaced with a zero , and the ls are replaced with zero , and all of the other letters are replaced with zero . a string of 19 zero is the most securepassword . cecil : i added an exclamation point at the end of my password . melony : exclamation points are impossible to hack ! you are very secure . tip 6 : there are two main types of computers . the first are pus , orpersona computers . personal computers know your name , and thingsabout your life , and are casual and friendly . sometimes they'reoverly personal and you end up having to say , ` ` this is all touch . back off , computer . '' the second type of computer is the house cat . these are ambulance robotic quadrupeds used by the secret police monitor our domestic behavior and try to understand why peoplelike to stroke roots and talk in high voices to them . cecil : this has been very helpful ! melony : ah ! thank you for saying that ! i love to be helpful ! this trial hasten so challenging , and everyone is upset . these days , i do not feelhelpful . these days i feel kind of useless and it gets me down . cecil : aww . i know that feeling . you know , sometimes when i ' m sad , i like to sing old hymn to myself . melony : me too ! which one ' s your favorite ? cecil : ♫ i got the eye of the tiger , a fighter ♫ cecil and melony singing together : ♪ dancing ' through the fire , ‘ cause i am a champion , and you'regonna hear me roar ! ♪ cecil : oh ! melony : wh oo ! that ' s my favorite passage from the old testament ! i feel better already . cecil : aww , thanks , melony . melony : i ' m sorry , i did not catch your name . goodby ! cecil : the mayor ' s office reports that perhaps their earlier call for not being alarmed was a bit premature , and that we could all stand to be a little more alarmed . several dead animals have been found all overt own – on sidewalk , in trees and fields , animal corpseseverywhere . thighs happened before , listeners . many of you remember the glowingcloud ( all hail ) thatpassed through night vale years ago , dropping dead animals on all of us . and since that first terrifying and bloody visit , the glow cloud ( all bow before the mighty cloud ) has since settled down as a citizen of this town , even joining the school board , as the glow cloud ' s child attends night valeelementary . it'shard to believe that the glow cloud ( all praise the malevolent cloud who rules my every puny desire , et cet era , etcetera ) would return to suchdreadful acts of violence against animals ... and rooftops . but again , it ' s hard to know why anyone does anything . johnpeters – you know , the farmer ? – standing out in his freshly-sownfield of imaginary corn near his pastures said he saw a couple of mangled squirrel and expired possess . headed , ` ` i seen them strangers too , the ones what do not move 'ceptfor their breathing ' ? just breathing ' and breathing ' and sometimesgetting a little closer than you think they were a second ago , despite not looking ' like they were even moving ' . '' heals said he finally received a card from his brother jim , who lefttown nearly 40 years ago to fight in the blood space war . the messageinside simply read , ` ` happy 12 th birthday , little brother ! onlythree months into my mission , and i am already missing you somethingfierce , johnny ! '' johncovered his face and pointed to one of the strangers out on the edge of the corn field . ` ` yeah , it ' s definitely them strangers what ' s killing ' these animals . '' johnthen began weeping and clutching the birthday card – on it , farmer caricature holding balloons , and a caution reading , ` ` i lovejoy , cows ' you ' re my brother '' – tightly to his heaving chest . and now , a word from our sponsor . today'sshow is brought to you by papa john ' s . at papa john ' s we make pizzawith only the fresh est ingredient , using old-world recipe passeddown from our family ' s many generations of pizza makers . nearly all of these pizza makers are still alive , making pizza and passing downrecipes . they live in the back . we ' re running out of room for them . we'velong given up on thinking they d eventually die . why do not they die ? i mean , we love them , but there are close to 50 people in our familydating back to at least the 1800s , their bodies aging and failing , but never ... you know ... dying . perhaps ' s our secret recipe causing that . you'dthink so , but it ' s not . because a few members of our family haveactually passed away ... although , now that we ' re thinking about it , those were public executions for treason back during the first world war . and another couple were car accidents . maybe it is the sauce ? either way , visit your local papa john ' s . order a delicious pizza . howard can it be ? immortality , we mean . papajohn ' s . it ' ll be fine . and now , a look at traffic . they met through a mutual acquaintance . they shook hands and met eyes.over food and drinks , and among friends , they laughed and toldstories . occasionallytheir eyes lingered . occasionally one looked away first . they shared brief but quiet and private moment on the front porch . it was getting late . people were leaving . it was a new moon that night.neither would remember that part . one of them said goodby as they headed to their car . the other saidgoodbye back . they hugged , both thinking in that short embrace about the other ' s body against their own , about the topography forgiveness , and the geography of tomorrow . ` ` see you again soon , i hope . '' ` ` yes , you too . '' theyparted as the one drove away . later , the other drove away . it was fun party with good friends , good food and drinks . they wouldremember the laughing and the stories . they would not remember the moon or the name of the other . it would not come up again . theater met other people , and still other people . later , they woulddrive home , and drive home . they never met again . they both livedmeaningful lives : laughing drinking , eating , and driving home . thighs been traffic . whileofficers from the sheriff ' s secret police are now responding to series of power outrages and broken water mains , witnesses havereported a strange sight at the city ' s dog park . hooded figures , which are sometimes glimpse inside the dog park , were all lined outside the dog park , as if standing guard . a long row of dark cloaks and hoods , humming and chanting . witnesseskept a great distance from this scene , simply noting the hoodedfigures were all of equal height and imposing stature , spaced evenlyaround the forbidden municipal park . thesidewalks in front of them were empty , except for one young couple – and their dog – who walked slowly past the entries , unperturbedby the presence of these aldrich figures , emanating a crescent white noise . witnesses watched the couple stroll past the park , turn corner , and disappear from sight . the witnesses reported that just around that corner , where the couple had walked , was a different person – a stranger , staring right back at the witnesses . they did not recognize the person , for the person hadn noticeable features . the stranger did not appear to move , except for its steady breathing . single witness saw the stranger move , but suddenly it was closer to the crowd of onlookers , merely feet away from them . one of the witnesses said , ` ` we should run away . '' anotheragreed , ` ` yes , let ' s run away . '' they did not go anywhere . and now , let ' s check in on the weather . you can hear me , night vale , it is because you are one of those stillwith electricity , or whose home is not on fire . oh , breaking news , there are a bunch of fires across town . they are spreading from home to home . fire chief among encarnación said that she believes the fires were started by the neglect of common but dangerous things like kitchen ranges , candles , cigarettes , and bloodstones . encarnaciónsaid these strangers are appearing at doorways , and in windows , and inside shower , and from behind refrigerator , just staring and breathing and otherwise not moving . upon seeing these strangers , the residents of those homes became frozen in fear , and thus incapable offending to their inflammable items . ` ` neverleave a blood stone unattended , night vale ! ` ` encarnación cautioned . mayordana cardinal finally relent ed to the sheriff ' s request to try to round up the strangers . sheriff sam responded with a jumping heelclick , and a ` ` you wo not be sorry , mayor ! '' as they ran out start making arrests . sam has long held that the strangers are just troublemakers who ' ve movedhere from the collapsed town of desert bluff , our former neighbors.but upon arriving at several of the burning homes , sam began to have change of mind ... or belief . thesestrangers were not from desert bluff at all . these strangers , sam now believes , are something else . ` ` they are not from here , '' sam said . ` ` not heremeaning night vale , but ... here . ` ` sam then indicated the broadness of the term 'here ' by swinging their arm slowly to indicate the entirety of the tangible world we all pretend to know and understand . the secret police , instead of arresting or detain ing or ... even gettingnear the strangers , began to move the petrified residents of each these homes safely away to an disclosed location . which , i assume , means the same thing as a safe location , since the secret police are law enforcement professional ... ? the strangers never moved , other than their steady breaths , even whether sometimes appeared dramatically closer than they were before . ` ` the strangers seemed to have no goal other than to threaten ourwell-being , night vale , '' sam explained wordlessly , using only along ribbon and floor dance routine to express the dire situation we are all facing . ` ` my secret police and i will to serve and protect you . secretly , of course . this is off the record . in the meantime , stay in your homes , and lock your doors . if you see a stranger , keepmoving , and call us . we ' re an enlisted number , actually , so ... maybeemail , '' sam said with a flick of their ribbon and a doublesomersault . nightmare , i ... i think back to the words of little league coach and ghostlucia tereschenko . ` ` they ' re no longer coming . they ' re here.and we can not stop something that wants nothing . '' an di think of the image of that young couple and their dog , blithelypassing the row of fearful hooded figures . no doubt it was maureen , and that boy , and that eagle . maureen is such a good kid ! and thatbeagle ? so , so cut e ! so cut e ! ugh.but i fear for whatever it is she and that boy and that dog are involved in . heed our sheriff tonight , night vale . stay safe in your home . get awayfast of you see one of them . staytuned next for words , ordered intentionally and confidently , sayingsomething , understanding nothing . and , as always , good night , night vale . ooh ! maybe lock those windows , too . good night . today ' s proverb : call me old fashioned , but i believe there should be only one continent .
WTNV|The Trial of Hiram McDaniels|1 May 2016|numbers do not lie . but humans usingnumbers lie all the time . welcome to night vale . the trial of hiram mcdaniels –five-headed dragon , former mayor al candidate , and current presumedcriminal – is coming to a close . there are only a few minor legaltechnicalities to get through , such as testimony from the remainingwitnesses , arguments from the lawyers , and deliberation from theory . and then , we ' ll have all that bureaucratic mess out of the way and be able to get to the verdict . we ' ll be covering the trial as continues , so stay tuned here for all your trial into . and now for community classified . item : big rico ' s pizza is looking fo ra new cashier . must have retail experience and be good at not talking they know what ' s good for them . no funny business ! no secret wheatspeakeasies . why would you even bring that up ? who have you beentalking to ? to apply , look at yourself in the mirror for a long time , until your face no longer seems to be your own . item : have you seen a tall shadowwhere no shadow should be cast ? have you seen a person exist in two places at the same time ? have you seen a young girl with anupside-down face ? no , you have not . that would be ridiculous ! grow up ! sincerely , richard . also , if anyone ' s seen my wife , please let me know . item : lost cat . blinding bright , orb-shaped , often visible in the sky during daylight hours . if found , please worship . and finally , item : i have not forgotten you all . let you live the first time . the next time you may not be so lucky.love , the woman from italy . this has been community classified . the night vale park s departmentannounced that after a multi-year , 5 million dollar repair and renovation project , the beatrix low man memorial meditation zone is once again open for public use . the meditation zone , astate-of-the-art meditation facility , was destroyed by amultidimensional sentiment pyramid almost four years ago . but theparks department used that crisis as an opportunity to update premeditation mats , equipment , and machines . now you can be hooked upland meditating in no time ! and it ' s almost twice as efficient before , when measured in gallons per kilowatt . the rebuilding was funded with simple tax levied on every school child per school day they attended , and the construction only went three years and 4.9 million dollarsover budget . we look forward to enjoying the new beatrix lowmanmemorial meditation zone for years to come . today the mayor herself , my formerintern and current friend dana cardinal , took the witness stand in hiram ' s trial – the final witness in the trial of the century . she looked at the citizen who had tried to overthrow her beating heart , to sabotage her lungs , to end the administration of life within embody , and calmly she met his eyes . and then calmly , she met his eyes.and then she met his eyes calmly . and then , still calm , she met his eyes . she did not even glance at the violet head , the only head wooded not participate in the crimes against her . her hands were tight in front of her.her shoulders were back . she looked tired , and she looked determined , and heavy with stress , and still barrel ing forward . judge adam asked her to swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but . ` ` you want the wholetruth ?

'' andre began to tell the truth . all of it , as she knew it . obviously we can report nothing of what she said . most of the crowd fled , horrified of what would be done with them if they heard even fragment of the mayor ' s testimony . the judge felt obliged to stay , but put on the sound-canceling headphones they assign all judges so none of them will hear anything that might make life too complicated.only hiram , already charged , already a criminal , listened withinterest as dana unfurled the shadows within her . another , she was done . she said , ` ` thank you , '' nodded to the judge , nodded to hiram , collected her belongings , and walked out of thecourtroom . soothe trial is continuing just fine , and we should reach justice whatever that means – quite soon . obviously , the transcribe for this day of the trial will be burned , along with the court stenographic . and now , the children ' s fun fact science corner . up is up , and down is down . left is right , and right is left . to the west there are the highest high , and to the east there are the lows . the up top is where the bluebirds go , and the witching happens down below . you need to cross the street , mind your shoes and mind yourfeet . for there are more to streets than horns that bl eat , or cars that speed , or lights that lead . therein something stranger yet that wants to take you , don'tforget . yes , there is something stranger still , and if it can , it could and it would and it will . its teeth are sharp , its eyes are sharp , its voice a dulcet ma ze . so walk real quick and step real light , and always look both ways . look to the left to see your own death , and look to the right to avoid great fright . and look for what hides under the cars that pass by , under the trucksthat speed , under the pavement weeds , under the shalt and sand , look for a quick grasping hand . up is up , and down is down . left is right , and right is left . to the west there are the highest high , and to the east there are throws . the up top is where the bluebirds go , and the witchinghappens down below . thighs been the children ' s fun fact science corner . the night vale airport announced a trial run of international flights.previously there were only the regular flights to lax , of , x ta , urban , and – of course – king city . but now , airportadministration is unveiling plans to reach more than 50 internationaldestinations including mexico , double mexico , and svitz . how these plans can be achieved – in a one-terminal airport with customs facilities and only the capacity to handle two passengerplanes at a time – has not been answered . martinmccaffrey , local representative of the t sa , waved away objections to the changes . standing in front of reporter and literally waving harms in physical dismissal of the questions being raised . he alsoadded an occasional ` ` pshhht !

'' collapsed to his knees , his face a perfect portrait of anguish , whileabove him the bright pink banner saying , ` ` celebrating a new airport for a new night vale '' flapped loudly in the rising wind , each gustbringing a sharp bark of plastic as martin crouched beneath , retreated into a sad helpless silence . you know , i have not traveled out of the country in a long time . i havehalf a mind to hop on one of those planes and head to svitzagain ... ooh , or even somewhere new ! maybe carlos and i could check out a nice resort somewhere tropical . ah h , that d be so fun ! mmm ... martin is now weeping , and crawling away from the podium , dragging hiscrumpled-up sketches with him , spit and s not dripping off his face , forming a trail in the dirt below him . tropical vacation could be just what we need ! and finally , a word from our sponsors . today'sshow is sponsored by keener brand tissue products . know that you have a lot of choice when it comes to your nose . for instance , you could choose to simply not have one . just pop it right off and go on with your day unhindered . or you could choose to havemultiple decorative noses that turn your face into a provocativemodern sculpture . but instead , you decided to have just the one nose ... that half the time does not work , and is exactly between youreyes , where it sits distracting in your vision at all times for no reason . of course , your brain tunes that out ... unless someone callsattention to it , so i guess that ' s not too bad . but , in general , you ' ve chosen the barely-functioning weird nose you have.and we ' re sure glad you did ! kleenexbrand tissue products . you have a lot of choice in life . we ' re glad you – for some reason – chose the faulty body you have . thighs been a word from our sponsors . updatefrom the trial : in alast-minute surprise , there has been a complete turnover in themakeup of the jury . previously , the jury was made up of seven humans and an a.i . simulating a five-headed dragon . this was all prettystandard . but now , without warning , announcement , or any decisionfrom the judge , the seven humans were removed from the jury . in theirstead were seven strangers . the strangers were un moving , unblinking.they breathed audible , even breaths . the hiss of air through theirnostrils , eyes fixed on nothing . judgeazdaq said that she does not approve of this change ... but also that she ' s too scared to question it . and anyway , she would find it hard to enforce any actions against it , since the bailiff , too , is now stranger , un moving , except that every time the judge looks away and looks back again , she swears the stranger is slightly closer than shew as before . the defense attorney , on behalf of the four heads he represents , offeredstrong objections from behind his desk , where he was hiding from the strangers . the prosecuting attorney joined his objections , and alsojoined him behind the desk . there was very little comment from the observers in the gallery – as most of them , too , had been replaced by un moving breathing strangers . ` ` well , i guess we should get right to deliberations , then , '' shouted the judge through the closed and locked door of her chambers . ` ` but we have not even given our closing arguments ! '' said both attorneyssimultaneously , sitting back-to-back so that they could keep theireyes on as many of the strangers as possible . the judge considered this argument , and responded by screaming that one of the strangers was in her chamber , and how did he get in there ? thetroys did not have an answer for that , and so the deliberationsbegin . listeners , while we wait to hear the verdict to this eventful and historictrial , let us take a quick peak at the weather . the trial of hiram mcdaniels is over . a verdict has been reached . theory that consisted of an a.i . stimulation of a five-headed dragon and seven silent un moving strangers only deliberate for a few minutesbefore returning with a verdict of guilty on all charges . the strangers breathed heavy , visible breaths . the a.i . booped and whistled . it was all very quiet , and polite , and quick . hiram'sheads responded in ways as different as their personalities . green , of course , roared and spat out a stream of fire unlike any ever seenfrom him before – white in its pure heat . goldnodded gravely , a politician politically accepting bad news . blue did not react visibly at all . grayslumped and curled into his own long neck , a look of supremedejection on his reptilian features . and purple sat tall – in satisfaction , rather than celebration . judgeazdaq said , ` ` well , let ' s get to sentencing then . '' and troy wash , lawyer for the defendant , prepared to speak , but the judge went onto say , ` ` there are no arguments to be made . if hiram is guilty attacking the mayor , of attacking the very civic structure of our town , then hiram must be put to death . we have no choice , '' she concluded . event roy wash , the prosecuting attorney , was taken aback by this sudden and severe sentence . he met eyes with his identical legal opposition , and made a small shrug . ` ` what am i supposed to do here ? '' hesignaled through the expressive language of the body . ` ` this isn'tmy problem , i guess . it ' s problem , but not problem . '' the judge continued . ` ` sentence will be carried out once all appealshave been received and disposed of . the guilty four heads will be killed with a single bullet each , so as not to harm the lungs , heart , or any other part of the body shared with the violet head , who is not charged by this court . '' ` ` but , '' violet shouted . ` ` but i am connected to them completely ! if my other heads die , then i will die , too ! '' greencontinued to roar , and for the first time , there was a hard spine anguish within the pulse of his anger . graysobbed loudly and ashamed . gold , still nodding at the court with a politician ' s poker face , surprisedhimself by throwing up – and , in doing so , gave up the pretense geniality . he , too , began to sob . ` ` i'mafraid , '' said judge adam , removing her glasses and cleaning themdistractedly with a bit of her robe , ` ` that justice is moreimportant than the life of every innocent who comes through thiscourt . if there is damage to more than the perpetrators , then that unfortunate , but unavoidable . take him away . '' sincere bailiff was an un moving stranger , the helpful ( but doomed ) courtstenographer led hiram away . violethowled that she could not do this , that he was not charged with any crime , but no one intervened . ajanitor brindled her cart forward to mop up the vomit left by gold . the few humans left observing the court seemed at a loss for what to do , and started to disperse in uncertain , uneven groups . theah . did not move , because it was a computer . the strangers in the courtroom did not move , either – although theyseemed just a little closer to the onlookers than they were before . and so ... that ' s it . that was the trial of hiram mcdaniels . he will be killed . his violet head , innocent , will also die . that ' s justice ... i guess . i guess we ' ve done it . good work , us ... guess . staytuned next for the awful void of your own doubts and feelings . good night ... guess . today ' s proverb : ` ` them ' s thebrakes , kid , '' said the most annoying driving instructor ever .

'' another each one of them pointed at that person , and each one of themsaid , out loud , ` ` you could be a murderer ! '' and each one of them was right . that person could be a murderer ! and then , keeping their fingers pointed , each one of them narrowed their eyes , and then they widened their eyes , and thenthey crossed their eyes , and then they un crossed their eyes because made it very difficult to keep an eye on the person they suspected murder , and then slowly they lowered their pointing fingers , and each one of them said , out loud to the other , ` ` i have my eye on you , suspect !

'' janicesaid . who is this fiend ? where will they strike next ? it could be anyone . could be anywhere . it is like that wonderful children'sbook classic , in which the reader is playfully reminded again and again that there ' s a monster at the end of the book , but then of course when the reader gets to the end of the book it turns out thatthere is indeed a monster and our children are eaten after reading ! wait , that ' s a wonderfulbook ! anyway , citizens , i urge you to please be safe . i would be so very upset you were not safe , so just ... you know , please . insight of the current emergency , the sheriff ' s secret police has sent spokesperson to the radio station to provide information and answering questions that might be raised about the current ` ` dangerousmurderer on the loose in the room that you are all '' in situation.and the spokesperson has just pushed their soft wet snout out frothy soil , and has , uh , used their long digging claws to tunnel their way into my booth . so , please say hello to the secret spokseperson . spokesperson : yes ... what ? cecil : uh ... well , you ' re hear to speak to us about the dangerous situation ? spokesperson : oh , sure , sure . citizens , we ' re completely in charge , there ' s nothing fear . cecil : okay , well that spokesperson : ah h ! cecil : oh , what ? spokesperson : sorry . i just thought of something really frightening . cecil : oh . well , that ' s okay spokesperson : oh my god ! cecil : okay , now what is it ? spokesperson : oh , know , i was just remembering how i was thinking of somethingfrightening , and now i ' m thinking about remembering it . because , truly , fear devours . anyway , the investigation is moving forward , and we have got our bestofficers on it . and all of the other officers who are not on it are busy worrying that apparently they are not the best officers . are theatre worst ? this will keep them up at night . they will toss , and theywill turn ... thus you can see everything is under control . i wouldn'tworry . i ' m great at not worrying . you might worry , though . it all depends on how well you deal with the stress of being in great danger . cecil : uh , well , how close are the secret police to identify ing a majorsuspect ? spokesperson : oh , man . wh oo ! that is some entitlement if i have ever heard it ! cecil : entitlement ? spokesperson : we ' re doing everything we can to stop this murderer ! like having murder mystery dinner theater , even announcing that there was somefoul play , well just this afternoon we ran through a neighborhoodcrying out , ` ` you ' re done for ! you ' re all done for ! '' and now you ' re saying name a suspect ? ' make an arrest ? ' keep us safe ? ' you are fine . you are all fine . probably . listen , you ' re either already dead , or you ' re fine for this exact moment . cecil : u mm , it does not sound like we ' re safe . spokesperson : uh – uh – the uh – i understand your concern , cecil . cecil : b ... and ? spokesperson : i do not know . i understand it , it seems valid . good concern . cecil : oh . spokesperson : i ' m go n na head back to the secret police hover-office in the cloudsuntil it gets a little less dangerous around here . cecil : no , wait . you ' re just go n na go hide ? spokesperson : no . cecil : oh ! but you – aug h ! you just nodded ! spokesperson : that does not sound like something i would do . all right , citizens , we are out of here . i hope that it all works out okay for you . justwrite down any concerns you have for us on a ... like a paper airplane , and then , like , toss it up to that one low-hanging cloud with al adder going up to it , and someone from the secret police will come to your aid ... just as soon as there are no murderers around and it is safe to do so . cecil : okay , now wait just one minute ... spokesperson : no no no no no . there is no need to thank me , cecil . but ... um ... but obviously i would appreciate it . it – it ' s ... always nice to thanked . cecil : okay , look , i am not going to thank you ! spokesperson : uh ... u mm ... i ' ll give you , like , a moment more in case you change yourmind , like , uh ... like a thank you would be nice . ok , no , i get it . there ' s no need to thank me ... if you ' re a jerk . cecil : oh ! spokesperson : goodby . cecil : sensing that they would not be safe relying on the protection of others , the citizens in the rec center were getting nervous . theywere shifting , some if them were shift , and one of them was a murderer . but they did not know which one , and so the citizens began to act in their own protection . and so they each looked back to that same stranger that they had suspected before , each one of them looking back at that same person except for those people who , you know , just refused to like , lookaround them , and so now found themselves without a partner . but thosepeople took thisopportunity to jump on board , and so they found somebody else that was similarly reluctant to participate . and so they ' re looking at their partners and you ' re looking at yourpartners , look at your partners ... excellent . all right , great . and the two strangers were pointing at each other once again , and in their deepest , coolest voice they said , ` ` i do not trust you . '' another they tried , successfully ( or not ) to raise one eyebrow , and thenthey said , ` ` but we ' re in danger , kid ! '' if they were go n na solvethis , they would need to work together . they would need to solve this as partners , but they did not have to trust each other or like eachother , no way ! and , in fact , one of them was already holding up a fist , and the other one was pointing at the ceiling . but they did not quite know which one of them should do which , because ... the instructions were not very clear on that point . so one of them began nodding , and the other one beganshaking their head , but again they did not know which one should which because , you know , the instructions were not altogether thereon that one either . but they just kind of worked it out between thermo of them , like , ` ` okay , i ' m ... i ' m go n na point , and no , and ... okay , and you fist and yes ? so i ' m point ... pointy and fisty.pointy fifty . pointy fifty . okay , cool . awe some , awe some . '' see how uneasy their working relationship ? what a comical ly odd pairing.what an unexpected du o ! they were a classic trope , these two . but there was a murder to solve , so they would reluctantly partner up all the same . and so they looked away from each other once again . watch out , murderer ! these two are on the case . al soon the case are some brave middle schools . as is ... as is standardthese days when night vale is in danger . yes , a brave group of childvigilantes and avid readers . and i have , here in the studio , theirleader , a courageous 14 year-old , one ... one of the few children to face down a librarian during the summer reading program and survive , tamika lynn . tamika : hello again , cecil . hello again , night vale . my militia of childreaders and i are working on – to discover who the murderer is . we are making inquiries and looking at clues and reading theacknowledgments in the backs of books . no one knows why thoseacknowledgments are there , or what they ' re trying to say , so we'releft to assume that they are a complex code for malicious purposes . cecil : ooh , naturally . tamika : my army and i are also wearing ca pes and donning bulletproof vestsmade from copies of thomas pinchot ' s against the day , so ... we should be safe from any murderer , and any murderer should be very un safe from us . we will have this casewrapped up soon which is good , because if we had to depend on thatmurder mystery dinner theater to solve the case , well , that murdererwould go on murdering until there was not anyone left to murder another they would not be a murderer anymore . actuallythat would solve the problem too , huh ? hm m . cecil : so , you ' re not impressed with the secret police ' s dinner theater ? tamika : oh , i hate all of that traditional ` ` audience members looking at each other auspiciously and then deciding to solve the case on thrown '' stuff that we all know from every murder mystery dinnertheater that we ' ve ever been to . i d rather the sheriff ' s secretpolice were stag ing one of those great mystery tales from the masters the craft , full of intrigue and plot twists and long lost twinbrothers and fake mustaches ... like default in our stars . ooh ! or the time traveler ' s wife . cecil : ah , yeah . tamika : oh ! or james joyce'sclassic spy caper arab . cecil : you know i just love the helicopter chase at the end of the timetraveler ' s wife ? and that and that catchphrase that she says right before she arrests the main bad guy ? tamika : oh ! oh , i know , i know . ` ` this one ' s for my husband . he ' s a timetraveler . '' cecil : yeah ! tamika : it ' s classic . cecil : oh , i love it ! tamika : and , of course , there ' s always the phantom tollbooth . cecil : ah . but that ' s not a mystery at all , that is a celebrity memoir . tamika : yes , but all copies come with a bejeweled dagger between chaptersseven and eight , so that should come in handy when fighting off murderer . in any case , do not worry about your dinner theater because if we tookdown a librarian ( and we did ) , and if we took down a despotic regime ( and boy , did we ) , then what chance does one murderer stand against the power of books ? heavybooks . heavy , heavy books dropped on their heads . cecil : wo w . tamika : i ' m go n na drop so many books on that criminal ' s head as soon as catch them . cecil : yeah . tamika : dump them right on there . ba m ! bunch of books . cecil : oh , yeah ! tamika : just a bunch of teenager running around crushing evil under the complete hardtack edition of all seven volumes of marcelproust ' s monument al novel , ramonaquimby , age 8. cecil : truly the american justice system is the greatest in the world ! tamika : all right , i must be off . remember : read , even a little , every day.that way you ' ll build up an immunity . cecil : great , thanks so much , tamik– tamika : books . to be clear , i was talking about books . cecil : oh . tamika : read books . cecil : yes . um , ooh ! thank you very much , tamika ! ohio dear . um , listeners , we are getting word that there has been nearly fatal incident back at the rec center , and many suspect thatthis was no mere accident . the 15-gallon tub full of old socketwrenches that was balanced precarious at op a few 2x6 planks of woodnext to the rec center basketball courts fell over , nearly crushing the pair of strangers who recently came begrudgingly together to helpsolve a terrible murder . thermo strangers had been getting in each others ' way , challenging eachothers ' authority , thinking things like , ` ` you ' re getting ' in my way , bud dy '' and ` ` nuh-uh , you are , '' and expressing their hurtfeelings using only the shapes of their mouths , worried that at any moment , in fact in just a few moments , they might have to look each other in the eye and say words out loud again . and all along , right above them , the tub full of wrenches entered . okay , look . eye contact can be uncomfortable , sure , but it is way lessuncomfortable than the weight of heavy metal objects falling uponthin human skull . and the tub full of wrenches entered , and the narrow planks beneath it groaned , groaned , and then gave , and thensnap ! and the two strangers looked back to each other once again , another both simultaneously shouted the word , ` ` duck ! '' another were right ! a duck flew in through an open window and knockedthat tub full of socket wrenches harmlessly out of the way . and thermo strangers looked at each other , and ... and smiled , and they bothsaid , ` ` you have duck telepathy too ? '' another they laughed , together . ah-ha-ha-ha-ha ! and it was a longhealthy true laugh . ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ! it was a completelynatural unforcedlaugh . ah-ha-ha-ha-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh ... another they turned away from each other , back to the job of solvingcrimes . but each one of them thought , ` ` i ' m beginning to have abe grudging respect for your skill , kid . '' sadly , that tub full of socket wrenches had been entering 12 feet off the ground on those thin pine boards since the rec center was built fiveyears ago , so ... wo o ! it is a real shame to lose such an importantarchitectural feature of such a historic building . now , in response to this dire circumstance , mayor dana cardinal has sent her official night vale director of emergency press conferences tissue an emergency press conference . so please welcome former mayorpamela mitchell . pamela : hello , people of night vale ! hello , non-people of night vale ! thenonexistent ones among us – you know you you are not – hello to the non-physical entities who drift among our bodies and our thoughts . well , how about that ? i try to be nice to the unseen nonexistent beings , and this is the response i get ! cecil : what response did you get ? pamela : i do not know ! cecil : oh h . pamela : that–that ' s the problem with the unseen ones , they ' re also unheard andunfelt . you know , i am thinking of having them arrested . which , considering that they do not exist , is the same thing as actuallyarresting them . uh , but , but ... there is a much greater danger to our town . cecil : right , the murderer . pamela : the mayor asked me to issue the following statement : insideevery new born child lives a tiny insect , which controls the child'smovements . the insect only understands physical needs and basicdesires . that insect sits in its little chair pulling levers animating the child grab and sleep and cry and eat . but one night , the insect leaves its chair from inside the child , and it crawl out of the child ' s ear , and slippers away into the forest where it curls up into a cochon . before it does this it whispers to the child , ` ` you are alone now . '' yearslater the cochon patches , and the insect emerges unchanged , and does not miss the child at all . and that child , like all children , grownup to be the president of the united states . cecil : that ' s the mayor ' s statement on the murderer ? pamela : the mayor did not say anything about murderers . she did not actuallywrite that statement . she does not even know i ' m here ! she ' s off at that dinner theater thing . cecil : now ... the murder mystery dinner theater , which is to , you know , soothe murderer ? pamela : great ! so what do you need the mayor for ? who cares if my story unrelated to murderers ? i – i do not know why i was reminded of suddenly . what am i , some sort of expert on memory ? i am . world-renowned . the point is , some people are worried about murderers . others are worriedabout other things . we all have our personal challenges . for instance , i just found out that i ca not see cars . cecil : you ca not see cars ? pamela : no ! no ! apparently i have never been able to . my ornithologist keepstrying different prescription lenses , but ... every time i go near highway , i just see people with their legs and arms outstretched in front of them zooming inches off the shalt . i have always wondered why other people did not find highways as hilarious and upsetting as id o . cecil : did you mean optometrist ? because you said ornithologist . pamela : i am 1/16th peregrine falcon on my father ' s side ! cecil , what i cameo speak to you about today is the real danger to night vale : indifference . cecil : that does not sound at all like what you came here to speak about . pamela : i call upon the citizens of night vale to take pride in their civicduties . do not let feelings of insignificance or ennui or excitementwhen a dog jumps up on your legs distract you from yourresponsibility to vote , to keep streets clean , to deny the existence angels , and to make holiday colonies for – for agents from vague , yet menacing government agency who sit outside your home , night after night , in stuffy black sedan , monitoring your dullconversations and lives . cecil : okay , but what about the murders going on right now ? it is not civicindifference to be terrified of dying ! pamela : agree to disagree . but listen , i ' m speaking to anyone currentlykilling someone : you alone are permitted to be totally indifferent.care less ... especially about killing people . uh , maybe care moreabout after school programs . so , in conclusion , care about everything your town , except killing people . cecil : thank you very much , pamela . pamela : it ' s pamela ! just on em ! i ' m going to use this water slide to go back to city hall now.whee ! cecil : and now an update on last week ' s power outrages . the night valeelectric utility announced today that there may be more power outagesin coming weeks . this time , due to sadness . ` ` we'vejust been sad this week , '' the electric utility said . ` ` not for any reason , just ... sometimes we get sad . what do we need a reason for ? last week we were feeling vengeful , so ... power outrages . this week we ' re feeling sad , and we ' re going to continue expressing ourselvesthrough the medium of power outrages . '' now , power outrages were , of course , certified by the supreme court as protected form of free speech in the 1973 case of the hayworthelectric company vs the haworth hospital . and the court stated thatreasonable causes for a power outrage include celebration of a specialsomeone ' s birthday , expression of directed anger at an intransigentpolitical system , and periods of just feeling sad for no reason . butte night vale electric utility would like me to remind you thatpower outrages are no excuse not to pay your electric bill . i mean , electricity is , after all , a privilege , not a right . failure to parlour electric bill may result in localised lightning storms , shroudedfigures standing silently in the back of familiar to shows , and gout.so ... the murder mystery dinner theater is still in full swing but frankly , give or take a falling tub of socket wrenches , there seems not to be much of a murder mystery left to solve . i mean , the murderer hasn'tmurdered anybody in quite a while . okay , okay , sure , a bunch of murders did happen today . but that was , like , several minutes ago ! maybe even a whole hour , and it just feels like , i do not know , why go digging through old dirt ? plus , i ' m not even sure that we could charge anybody with those crimes . mean , the statue of limitations ? you know , that statue of our own limitations that we all carved last year ? just feels like , i don'tknow , we might be done here . sorry to disappoint anybody that was looking for the whole ` ` mystery '' side of things to be rest sorry , listeners . i just ... i thought i heard something . i mean , somethingoutside of the sound of my own voice and – and – and that smallest of owl s that ' s kept in the corner of every radio studio . but there should not be anybody here ! everyone has to be at the rec center . it ' s the law , and nobodybreaks the law ! nobody except ... law breakers ! listeners , i think the murderer may have taken advantage of the fact that all citizens are at the rec center and they ' ve crept over here to the radio studio where i ' m all by myself . i see movement in the dim of the control booth . hello ? are you here to feed the owl s ? answer . carlos ? carlos , is that you ? nothing.just the sound of my own breath , in and out . even as you are all hearing my voice right now , i am alone . or worse yet , i am not alone . footstep behind me . and another . and another . the sound of someonewalking toward me . the murderer is here at the radio studio . a shadowreaches across my desk . the murderer is here for me , and i narrating my own devise ! listeners , there is only one thing left to do , but i must act quickly ! i mistake all of you ... to the weather . hello , night vale ! ah h ! it is a relief to say those words aloud , alive , and to you once again . justafter introducing the weather , i felt movement and i heard footsteps , and i saw my life flash before my eyes and its imminent ending madethem water . another , the murderer attacked , and i – and i could i tried scream , but i could manage only faint gargle to no one . well , except , you know , one person , but it was like the person leastlikely to provide me aid . fortunately , i had a copy of lo is lo wry ' s novel thegiver , which tamika had loan ed to me recently , and it was delimited edition that comes without cover or pages or words , and is made entirely out of wood and metal and is in the shape of a hammer . it'sactually just a hammer . tamika loan ed me a hammer . anyway , unfortunately , uh , the hammer was just out of my reach so i stretched out my hand , reaching , struggling , grasping for that classic contemporary children ' s literature so i could crack the head of attacker . and that is when i heard a noise . and , listeners , i thought it was death rattle . or my death chime . or even rarer still , my deathtrombone . but it was a shout . it was two shouts . two people . another i felt warmth , and i felt air gasp into my chest , and – and i – i felt the hands upon me loose , and i saw the two people who saved , and then they brought me here , now , to the rec center , here , withal of you ! well , not just all of you , but specifically ... youth murderer . stand up , please . and all the citizens of night vale pointed at the murderer and gasped ! another all shook their heads , not in anger , just in disbelieve ! an di asked the murderer , ` ` why ? '' and the murderer answered . but i just talked right over them becauseanything they had to say was moot in light of their heinous crimes ! now , we all know that the murderer must be punished in the way that everymurderer is punished here in night vale . and the punishment is coming ! here it comes ! ah , the punishment is severe i ca not even look ! the crowd all said to the murderer , ` ` please do not ever murder again ! '' and the murderer shrugged their shoulders and said , ` ` sure ! '' yeah , and they applaud ed this former criminal for reforming their railways . and all the citizens of night vale just let that tension relaxfrom their shoulders , happy to know that this person willdefinitely ... probablynever murder again . now , of course , i have not forgotten about the two strangers , the two heroes , that odd couple , that unlikely du o , those two that saved my life back at the radio station . while all of night vale sat huddledhere in the rec center dreading murderers and actors and live theater ! ? , these two put their seemingly incompatible minds to work , and one of them noticed that the murders had stopped , and realized that the murderer must have left to find other people murder , but ... who was left in town to murder ? and the other one realized , it must be cecil . for cecil was by himself at the radio station . he alone was alone . and so , without having exchange a word , with only a knowing glance , these two rushed to the radio station and saved my life . and the danger was over , and – and the case was solved , and no one elsewould die this day . or , if they did , it would be because their bodyjust simply stopped , just like had an error and then they toppledright over . but not because of anything as mundane as murder . and so the two strangers looked back to each other one last time , wavering in their eye contact . they had been through so much , another had seen each other through all of it . what luck they had in picking a counterpart so competent and so trustworthy , and so completely not a murderer ! so they wink at each other . wink ! * yeah , but , like , big winks . *wiiiink ! * maybe they did not , i do not know . you know , maybe for just one moment , they just simply looked at each other with whatever faces , withwhatever feelings and emotions , with whatever moment that is thismoment , just their honest serves , for better or worse . another they give each other a smile , and a thumbs up ! yeah ! like , a big smile ! with a lot of teeth ! like , an unnatural amount of teeth ! another they looked back at the stage , still smiling because these two , you two had done it ! these ex-strangers , these friends , these great , these true , these investigator . you . shakespeare ' s famous detective character , verona mars , once said , '' all the world ' s a stage , and all the men and women are frightenedpeople blackmailed into acting upon it . '' and the evening turns to night . and soon , all of the citizens of nightmare will disperse back to their homes , and their hovels , and theirhideaways , and their witching cases . but for this one evening , we all came together . and what are human beings but a coming together ? what are we for , except to lean into thosearound us , to balance against those around us . a– a– a delicate , but provocative sculpture . the night vale murder mystery din er theater is over , sure , but whathappened within it will have always happened . we livedtogether this night ! and we always will have . look ... warman come from anywhere , or anyone . whether it is a stranger , or friend , or one of those traffic intersections that has poisonoussnakes instead of traffic lights ... but still , we reach out the hand.still , we allow our eyes to meet . still , we hope for the best , and weary to be the best in return because if not , then what else ? if not ... then nothing . human life ... it ' s just this . it ' s a moment of eye contact in a crowd . staytuned next for tomorrow . by any means necessary . goodnightto all of you listeners here . andgoodnight , night vale . good night . bonus track – michelle nguyen cecil : michelle nguyen has dropped by the radio station , and she says that she has a really big announcement . and like , could i just stop talking for a moment , because she ' s really trying to share an authentic part of herself , like really , you know , connect , or whatever ?

'' cecil : john ... up : mm ? cecil : did you or did you not see a murder ? up : these beings , they were of ... astonishing structure . they took me intothe craft , and they showed me times and places far and along fromthis here and ago . did you know , cecil , that the universe is not in fact a single ever-expanding four-dimensional sphere of life and matter ? no , no cecil ! the universe , i have learned , is merely particle composed entirely of itself , and comprising ' a greaterversion of itself . a repulsive function of its own body , repeatedlike identical cells formed in the shape of that which each cellphysically expresses . you know i think of benoit mandelbrot'sfamous set of equations . each operation a repeated pattern , psychedelic and vast . our universe is not made of matter , nor tenor space , cecil . our universe ... is made of possibilities . cecil : so you saw ... nothinguseful or interesting at all ? up : oh , oh ! oh , oh , yes . then these beings placed me , childlike , backdown upon my earth , and their craft sprang up into the air , leaving strange imaginary shape in my imaginary corn field . i held my hand up in farewell ... through the windows , i could see them hold up ... whatever it was they had at the end of their limbs . they were astonishing structure ! and then ... they were gone . i do not believe will ever be the same again . i do not believe i ' m the same now . cecil : oh , john . i should have known that you were a farmer , not a witness ! this is why witness ing should be left to the professional . paidwitnesses , who will witness whatever crime you want for a nominal fee . this is how witness ing should be done , not by – i ' m sorry amateur citizens who might see incorrect things or repeat forbiddentruths . up : oh . i- i just really wanted to tell that story . i- i ' m sorry could not be of any help with the murder . ever since this morning ' i- i ' ve just been too busy weeping ' in awe and transcendent grief witness anything at all ! cecil : it ' s ok , john . but please , next time only call if you havesomething interesting you want to tell us . goodby , john . up : goodby , thank you cecil ! cecil : mm hm m , absolutely . bonustrack : melony bennington cecil : computers . they seem difficult to use , right ?

the stars . you know , the stars . no teach star , but some of the stars . i mean every single one of theaters at once . i mean the whole night sky added up . do you ever look at the sum of the stars ? the night sky , as an equation ? beauty as amath problem ? which it is – everything beautiful is math.everything beautiful is a problem . what was your question ? cecil : u mm , how are you doing ? melony : oh . i ' m fine . cecil : now ... melony , you sound familiar . melony : do i sound familiar ? you just said that , so i guess i do . you gustave met one of my programs ... or not met , none of them are sentiment . you ca not meet things that have nosentience . well , i guess you could be like , ` ` hi there , pile frocks , i ' m melony , '' just to see what happens . i guess there is no set dogma for social engagement . god , i wish i had a dog . have you ever met a rock ? also , what was your name again ? cecil : well i'm– melony : what i ' m saying is that i probably sound familiar because all of programs have the same voice as me . that ' s how computer programmingworks . cecil : have you ever programme a computer that broadcast on a radiostation , specifically one that recites random numbers ? melony : oh ! oh , yes ! wzzz ! yes , that was one of my early programs . and thosenumbers and chimes are not random ; they ' re encoded messages foreign spies . also a few pudding recipe and a funny cryptology poem or two . cecil : so you made fey , the voice of wzzz ! melony : oh , the wzzz program had no name , and absolutely no sentence . not every program is sentiment . that wzzz program only recites numbers acetones . that ' s all it does , and all it ever will do . cecil : but - melony : it does not know it exists . cecil : but i- melony : oh , just listen to me bubbling on ! you had me on to talk computer tips , so let ' s give your listenerssome computer tips . ah em . tip 1 : computers can make you angry . anything can make you angry.computers are anything . tip 2 : is your computer plugged in ?

cecil : yes . melony : oh , good . tip 5 : the most secure password possible is ( you ' ll never guess this ! ) : where the o is replaced with a zero , and the ls are replaced withers , and all of the other letters are replaced with zero . a string of 19 zero is the most secure password . cecil : you know , sometimes i like to add an exclamation point at the end . melony : oh , exclamation points are impossible to hack ! you are very secure . tip 6 : there are two main types of computers . the first are pus , or personal computers . personal computers know your name , and thingsabout your life , and are casual and friendly . sometimes they'reoverly personal and you end up having to say , ` ` it ' s , it ' s justo much ! back off , computer .

louie : perfect . cecil : excellent ! thank you so much , louie ! bonustrack : hiram mcdaniels cecil : so , with a murderer on the loose in our community , fingers are starting to be pointed . and most notably they are being pointed hiram mcdaniels , a former mayor al candidate and literal five-headeddragon ... who attempted to murder our mayor not too long ago . so , in response , hiram asked that he be allowed to speak on the air . and so , please welcome the five striking charismatic ( and criminal ) heads hiram mcdaniels . hiram'sgold head : thank you , cecil . now , we ' ve had some experience lately with the , uh , law , as it were . hiram'sblue head : we face quite seriouscharges with a maximum sentence of five life sentences , to be servedconcurrently , by five different heads . hiram'sgray head : that ' s true , blushed . and everyone is mad and yelling a lot , and it makes me feels . hiram'sgreen head : i'mmad and yelling all of the time , and that does not make you sad ! hiram'sgray head : oh , sure , green , you ' re right . hiram'sgold head : okay , okay . blue , green , gray , all of you relax . now , remember what we said . hiram'sviolet head : the dragon headsthat stand together are strong together ! cecil : oh , well that ' s very inspiring , violet head ! hiram'sviolet head : also , the tree liberty must be refreshed from time to time with a much made frothy bones and organs of innocent ! cecil : okay , now wait ... what was that ? hiram'sgold head : what ? cecil : i – i mean , i just heard your violet head say that there is ... hiram'sgold head : no ! no pe . sordid not . cecil : okay . hiram'sgold head : would not matter you did . what matters is that since our troubles with the law , we'vebeen practicing ' the art of disguise more . previously we pretended to be a human called frank chen . but now that everyone knows about the frank chen disguise , we ' ve come up with a new plan . hiram'sblue head : we will disguise each of our heads as a different head . no one will know with which of ourquintumbred they are speaking . hiram'sgold head : for instance , whichhead is this speaking ? mystery ( gray ) head : all of you are tiny and sad , i ' m also tiny and sad ! let ' s all be tiny and sad together , roar ! cecil : well , that was the gray head . hiram'sgold head : no , na h , na h , nah.listen to that rage , cecil . don't– do not you think it waste ... green head , maybe ? eh ? green ? cecil : no , no , it was definitely the gray head , because i – i – i know , because i – i saw the gray head talking . hiram'sgold head : all right , all right.but ... all right . which head is this ? mystery ( gold ) head : oh ! everything is conspiracy , and i am entrusting of everyone ! look at how purple i am ! hiram'sviolet head : i ' m violet , not purple ! hiram'sgold head : right , right . mystery ( gold ) head : eh ... uhhh ... look at how violet i am , which is a word that meanspurple . those are the same words , ugh , but i ' m particular about which one , look at me ! hiram'sgold head : see , now , uh ... whichhead said that ? cecil : well , i – i mean , sordid , gold head ! i mean – hi – hiram , i can see each of you talking ! hiram'sblue head : he ' s using his eyesagainst us . we need to do a blind test . hiram'sgold head : yeah , that makessense . hiram'sblue head : indeed . mostefficient would be a heated blade ... cecil : hiram'sblue head : ... but the eyes couldalso be manual ly removed . cecil : uh , y y you know what ? i ' m just go n na turn my back , okay ? hiram'sblue head : yes . i suppose thatalso works . now another head who is not me , the blue head , willcommence speaking . mystery ( blue ) head : life is sad , and i am sad , and i wo not listen to what any other heads tell me aboutregular exercise , or a few minutes spent outside occasionally . it is i , the sad gray head . hiram'sblue head : so ? which head was speaking there ? cecil : you – i mean– you – you did not even change your voice , like , at all , blue head . hiram'sblue head : he ' s peeking ! he'speeking ! cecil : no , i mean , please do not take this the wrong way – hiram'sblue head : remove his eyes ! cecil : no ! no no no no no no no ! i mean , please do not take this the wrongly , but , i mean , not because you are a towering five-headed dragon , but maybe , you know , you ' re not terribly good at this . hiram'sgold head : all right , thencecil . uh ... you might maybe be right about that . hiram'sblue head : maybe we do not have the proper technique and training for these kinds of charades . hiram'sviolet head : maybe our conspiracy is a failed one ! hiram'sgray head : maybe we do not feelgreat about that . hiram'sgold head : but then cecil , partner , you explain one thing to us . hiram'sgreen head : however voice you ' ve heard since you last spoke was actually all me ! the green head ! cecil : oh ... oh my go oh , well , green , you are excellent those voices , then ! hiram'sgreen head : of course i am ! i lord my greatness over you , human filth , like a god ancient times ! hiram'sgold head , or so we assume for the moment : yeah , r– green is real good at all that stuff , it turns out . it'sprobably because green is just naturally better than us ateverything– hiram'sgold head : oh ! hey ? did you hearth ? that was green head again . i did not say that last one . cecil : it ... it sounds ... okay , it sounds like you two have a lot to work outdo ... good luck with that . hiram'sgreen head : have no need for luck ! i have fire breath ! farewell , human ! cecil : oh , all right . bonustrack : careless old woman cecil : listeners , i can see a slight movement in my periphery , and i can feel just a gentle chilly touch along my neck . oh , and also my coffee mug has moved from where it was , i mean just a moment ago , twas ... it was here on my left . and now it ' s upside down and on my right and crawling away on spider legs . which is kind of unusual ... facelessold woman : hello cecil . it ' s me , thefaceless old woman who secretly lives in your home . cecil : hm m , i thought that was you ! you know , it makes it kin da hard to talk to you when i can never really see you . fo w : cecil , there ' s a murderer on the loose , and everyone is going to die . cecil : i doubt that the murderer is go n na kill everyone . fo w : oh no , sorry for the confusion , those were two separate thoughts.there ' s a murderer on the loose , period . end of thought . next : everyone ' s going to die . cecil : well fo w : end of second thought . cecil : that ' s a relief . um ... hey , so you secretly live in every person'shome , right ? so you must know who the murderer is . fo w : oh , i absolutely know who the murderer is . cecil : great ! so you can help us track down and find this criminal ? fo w : sure , i ' ll tell you what i know . the murderer has eaten hundreds of flies in their sleep . the murderer has shirts with buttons , but i'veremoved some of those buttons with an old knife i found in pamelawinchell ' s mail box . the murderer sometimes stares at birds.sometimes the birds stare back . bird watching goes both ways . did you know birds talk ? not through something so manipulation andcorroded by history as words and sentences , but through the clearclean language of hunger and horror , and boredom , and rotaryproductive desires . a chattering of startings told me once , and quote , ` ` tree . '' then they said , ` ` we ' re in a tree . '' theyrepeated it over and over , and it was the most interesting story i'veever heard . cecil : ok , so do the birds know who the murderer is ? fo w : i was in tristan cortez ' s house the other night and he couldn'tfind his remote . he just kept shouting , ` ` stop it ! you ' re theorist ! '' at his television . and ... cecil : okay ... fo w : ... i started to feel sad for him , because it was that property brothers episode where they keep taking out walls while securing the home buyers on the importance of an open floor concept . they remove every single interior wall , and then the outer walls of the home , and then the surrounding trees and vehicles and other homes and adjacent buildings , until everything is gone and all is void . and the closing credits of the episode are justjumbles of letters drifting aimlessly on screen . to the whispers of , '' open floor concept . open floor concept . '' cecil : but what fo w : they reallyjumped the shark with that episode . so out of pity , i revealed totristan where i hid his remote . cecil : but the murderer fo w : it was just behind his right eye . it took him a while to get it out , but he finally did it because i gave him pamela ' s old knife . only now his remote is all sticky and he has to get a new rug and couch . cecil : ok , so is tristan the murderer ? i ' m confused here . fo w : we ' re all murderers , cecil ! where do you think meat comes from ? cecil : oh uh , well meat ... fo w : it sure does not come from animals . cecil : that ' s ... wait , where doesmeat come from ? ! fo w : i did not finish my story . in conclusion , i know who the murderers . everything will be fine . i ' ll keep a close watch on hesitation . i wo not stop anything from happening , but i will watch it closely . cecil : well , careless old woman ... welllisteners , it appears she ' s gone . bonustrack : dana cardinal cecil : our municipal government is obviously concerned with today'semergency situation , and has asked me to give some time to my formerintern and our current mayor , mayor dana cardinal . so let ' s welcome her now ! dana : thank you , cecil . hello , members of the public . hello , day-pass members of the public . hello , invited guests of the public , junior initiates of the public , and of course members of the secret orders , who are definitely not here and not all waving enthusiastically and holding up invisible secret orderpennants in the front row . cecil : hm m . dana : i speak to you today not as a mayor , but as a friend . so you ' re not friends with me , sorry , this one is not for you . cecil : go on . dana : i know that having a murderer on the loose is scar y . it frightening to be reminded that you could die at any moment . it frightening to know that a member of your community holds evil in their hearts . it is frightening when a mask-wearing employee of haunted house jumps out at you shouting ` ` b oo ! '' turbulence when ' m flying also freaks me out . this is just a list of some thingsthat are frightening . not all of them immediately apply . cecilia kind enough to give me some time on this microphone , because used my municipal powers to take this air time , whether he wanted me to or not . i rely on the kindness of others , but also if others are not kind , i can take care of things myself . murders a rare threat in night vale . by the way , have you ever noticed how ` ` threat '' and ` ` treat '' are almost the same word ? i have . i notice it a lot and that ' s why wrote ` ` threat '' here in this speech , just to challenge myself today the correct word . now i ' m doubting that i said the right word.i hope i said the right word . and no one in town quite knows how to handle a murderer , so here is someadvice from murder experts that could help keep you safe . the first step is to make yourself bigger than the murderer . stand stall as you can , put on lots of layers of clothes and drinkembiggening portions to make yourself as large as you can possibly be.the murderer will be less likely to attack if you have drunk manypotions , growing unnaturally until you resemble a skyscraper , or cliff base , or a very large person . also not make eye contact with the murderer . that could be taken as sign of aggression . it is safest if you remove your eyes completely.that may sound difficult , but actually the physical actions required do that are nightmarishly simple and horribly possible to do without your hands . avoid any sudden movements and certainly do not run . running might cause you to lose weight , and remember we ' re trying to look bigger than the murderer . the murderer may just be attacking you defensive ly to protect their cubs.if so , you may be able to prove you are not by threat by playingdead , or by being murdered right away . simply play dead or just go ahead and get murdered . by appearing or being dead , the murderer will not presume you to be dangerous , and thus will leave you alone . the night vale city government hopes that this information has beenhelpful to you . i hope that this information has been helpful to you.i care about you , all of you . i care about you , cecil . cecil : thanks dana , i ... thank you for the advice . um , it was , it was good to speak to you again . dana : oh you too , cecil . i always like being on your show . cecil : yeah ! dana : ok , i should go . i need to put on my mayor al cloak and then drinksome embiggening portions . cecil : all right . thank you , mayor cardinal . bonustrack : kevin cecil : listeners , do you hear that ? there ' s this strange noise . it'slike ... it ' s like the lowest note on a piano . no , that ' s not it . it ' s like short scale but using only the black keys . no , that ' s not it either . i ' m sorry . oh ! the noise is exactly similar to ... winter . do you hear that noise ? it seems to be coming from my broadcastingequipment . it – it seems like someone is trying to talk to me . it'slike ... it ' s like someone is approaching the microphone , and about to speak . kevin : hi , friends ! this is kevin ! radio host of desert bluff . is thiscecil of night vale ? cecil : mm-hmm . kevin : i ' ve missed you , old friend ! we hardly ever talk anymore ! cecil : last time we talked , you were representing a giant corporation thattried to enslaved our town , so yes , good point . we hardly ever talkanymore . kevin : we should not let small town feuds get in the way of our friendship . cecil : no , we definitely should ! additional , i do not like desert bluffssports tea ms . kevin : yes , sports rivalries are fun ! they ' re like friendships , but withless sublimate anger and more visualized shouting . cecil : now wait , kevin , why are you interrupting my radio transmission ? kevin : well , i heard something . a noise . it sounded just like hayn leaving one direction . oh yes , there it is again . i heard the noise , and i ran to my radiostudio and , well here we are . what a strange thing , the happenstanceof the universe causing us to meet by chance again and again . also , have a frequency jammer . i jammed your transmission , and that noise is the sound it makes . so , that ' s another element to the story . you believe in things like stories , or truth . i just wanted to see how you were doing ! hi ! how are you doing ? cecil : well , there ' s a murderer on the loose in my city . and now there'syou on heloise in my headphones . kevin : ha ha ha ha ! you are one of the funniest people i know ! i never quiteunderstand your jokes . that is why we ' re such close friends ! cecil : kevin , we are not friends ! you tried to enslaved our city , with ... withhelicopters and armed guards and a smiling god ! kevin : oh sure , i remember all of that . but try to see it from my point of view ! i mean not literally . not like , pull your eyes out and jam themstill bloody into my skull . we could not do that , because we ' re only talking via radio right now . let ' s use a sports metaphor . do you remember that famous gamebetween desert bluff and night vale , where the officials made controversial interpretation of league rules ? cecil : are we talking about football or ... ? kevin : oh , i do not remember all the minor details . cecil : i mean , was the field shaped like a diamond or was it likerectangular ? kevin : i remember everyone was wearing numbers . and right above the numberswere big bar codes , to allow referee to track the players . so guess that could be any sport . cecil : ice ? was it on ice ? kevin : i do not even know what ice is . cecil : alright , i guess that rules out basketball then . kevin : the point is , cecil , that people process the world the way theirpeers process the world . like that noise we heard before . i mean , heard it one way , you heard it another . for me , it was very similar to the end of a multi-city national tour . cecil : but that ' s just ridiculous ! clearly it sounds like the beginning another international tour . kevin : exactly . but someone somewhere else might hear it differently . thosepeople might hear it as subtle cinema tic scoring underneath dramatic speech . see ? we do not care about the comic justice of the sportsofficials ' judgment . we look to see if it favors our town society , and then we selfish ly react . right now , there ' s a murderer on the loose in night vale , and you'reworried because you care about your community . you fear for yoursafety and the safety of those you love . but you only feel that way because you are a potential victim of death or – much much worse a potential victim of loss . how do you think the murderer must feel ? knowing that everyone is scared of and angry at them . i bet thatmakes the murderer feel pretty bad about himself . cecil : what ? ? kevin : i try to see things from both points of view . every story has two equal sides . yes , there is a murderer on the loose , and murder illegal . but also , there ' s a poor citizen , a human being ( maybe ) who is being ostracized from society because of who they are and whatthey like to do . that is equally sad . a sports team might win on bad call , but they might also lose on a good call . that is equallyunjust . a radio host might join a tyrannical corporation that tries to subjugate all of night vale , but night vale might also fight backillegally , unfairly forcing that radio host to lose his job . that is equally tragic . i just wanted to tell you that ... i feel no ill will between us overt he whole ` ` armed takeover of your town '' thing . i ca not really feel anything anymore . but i can smile . smile verywide . want to hear ? cecil : definitely not ! kevin : oh , listen to my smile ! cecil : oh hey , the music totally stopped all of a sudden ! i bet that means you have to go now . kevin : no , really it ' s no bother , i ' m having a delightful time ! cecil : me too , me too ! hey , let ' s try pushing this button that says '' frequency unjammer '' ! kevin : oh do not push that , that does not sound fun at all ! cecil : and there we go . kevin : it looks like i ' m losing your signal ! until nexttime , cecil , until next time ! bonustrack : lacey her nez cecil : an update on last week ' s power outrages . the night vale electricutility announced today that there may be more power outrages inupcoming weeks . this time , due to ... sadness . for more on this , weturn to municipal call rep , lacey her nez . hey , lacey ! laceyhernez : oh hello , cecil ! cecil : so , uh , power outrages , huh ? lacey : absolutely . and it makes sense . the electric utility has been sad this week . not for any reason , sometimes they get sad . and it ' s not fair to expect them to have a reason . for instance , last week theywere feeling vengeful , and so they got their revenge using the weapon of power outrages . this week , they ' re feeling sad , so they'reworking through that using the medium of power outrages . cecil : but what about those of us who need electricity to see in the dark , or maintain life support or most importantly , listen to the radio ? lacey : ah , well . you see , power outrages were certified by the supreme courts a protected form of free speech in the 1973 case of hayworthelectrical company versus the haworth hospital . you see , the courtstated very clearly that reasonable causes for a power outrage includecelebration of a special someone ' s birthday , expression ofundirected anger at an intransigent political system , and periods of just feeling sad for no reason . and ... and please remember : dis agreeing with someone ' s speech , or even just frowning within a48-hour period of them making it , is basically the same as repressing . it says so right in the constitution . cecil : ooh well , fair enough . lacey : mm hm m , yeah . cecil : now lacey , do you have any idea how long the power outrages mightlast ? lacey : oh , i do not know . couple days , couple weeks , i ca not say . the electric company has a lot to work through . they do not like to scythia themselves , but recently , the gas works stopped speaking to them . no one knows exactly what the fall out was about , but electrical been real down ever since . cecil : aww , that ' s too bad . but you know what ? i never thought the gas works was very good for them anyway . lacey : oh , oh , i know , i agree ! the gas works might seem nice if you just eat lunch together sometimes , or hang out with them at a party once in a while , or use their services to heat your home , but i don'tthink they ' ve ever committed to ca ring about anyone . i once cooked entire meal on my gas range , only for gas works to not call or text me for days after ! cecil : ugh ! lacey : did that dinner not mean anything ? cecil : ugh ! lacey : they did not deserve the electric company . cecil : yeah ! lacey : mm . anyway , more importantly , the electric company is sad , becausesometimes utility companies just get sad . you ca not just say , '' cheer up ! '' or ` ` it ' ll get better , '' or ` ` please turn electricity back on ! '' and expect everything to be fine . they'llneed some good , long power outrages to work through this . cecil : well , i am really sorry to hear that . can ... can you let me know ... or let them know that i ' m thinking about them ? lacey : i sure will ! that ' s very kind . now that i have you feelingemotionally prostrate and vulnerable , please remember that poweroutages are no excuse to not pay your electric bill . cecil : really ? because it seems like lacey : electricity is a privilege , not a right . failure to pay electricbills may result in localised lightning storms , shrouded figuresstanding silently in the background of familiar to shows , and gout . cecil : well , you could have just said ` ` gout . '' i mean , you did not ha veto list all of its primary symptoms . lacey : well . uh , it ' s been nice chatting with you as always but i should go . it looks like the water company
WTNV|Who's a Good Boy? Part 1|1 June 2016|who ' s a good boy ? who ' s the good boy ? who is it ? who is it ? ! ? welcome to night vale . all over town , the question painted walls , written in the sky by our flying ac es , tapped out in morsecode from within the walls of our homes : ` ` who ' s a good boy ? '' the radio station is , um , un available , as so much of the town is currently un available . donor maintenance , wiped off the map , however you want to say it . the strangers who do not move , but who seem closer every time you look , they have torn our town apart.they do not seem to have an agenda , no plan , just ... destruction . theyonly seek to re nd , to shatter . carlos has locked himself in the lab with his team of scientists , working without sleep to find a solution to this crisis , as they have found solutions to so many crisesbefore . he wanted me to stay there with him , since within the proximity of science is , of course , is the safest place to be in unnatural or unnaturaldisaster , but ... i am a reporter . i ca not not report ! my town needs me to witness ! and so i will walk through my city , and i will witness . i sent my sister abby and her family the lab so they could keep my niece safe . ` ` keep them safe ! '' i said to mybrother-in-law steve . ` ` aw , gee , '' he said . ` ` with abbyaround , i ca not imagine a bad thing that could happen ! '' he really loves my sister . if i ' m to spend this time witness ing , maybe i should start there . maybe should , finally , allow myself to see the depth of his love for my sister and their daughter . ugh ! and then he tried to hug me , andre smelled like onions , and i shouted , ` ` oh , no no , no no . we – we d better get you barricaded in there , steve . i think i see somestrangers not moving , '' while i slammed the lab door on him . the wreck age of night vale incomplete . it is even worse than valentine ' s day 2013 , when much of the town was reduced to rubble and candy hearts . i passed by the desert flower bowlingalley and arcade fun complex , site of so many great – and terrible memories . old woman josie , throwing the ceremonial first pitch of the bowl ing tournament , city council and station managementfinding ... horrify ing love on the skating r ink , and other memories , too , that i ... do not like to talk or think about . now the complex was boarded up , undersiege from the strangers . there were three of them in its parking lot . none of them were moving . the only car in the lot was upsidedown and on fire . dark owl records was , somehow , untouched . it was the only building in blocks without smashedwindows , and it somehow still had electricity . michelle nguyen informer inter maureen were leaning casually outside , smoking candycigarettes . and this took a lot of re-lighting , as candy cigarettes not burn well at all . ` ` maureen ! michelle ! '' i said . ` ` you ' re okay ! '' they both rolled their eyes . ` ` michelle , how did you keep dark owl from being destroyed along with everything else ? '' she glanced atmaureen . ` ` mmm , '' she said . ` ` well , '' maureen said . ` ` say ... someone was leading an army . or whatever.then , they could command that army to not attack a specific person or place . or whatever . so maybe , that ' s what happened . anyway , if that'swhat happened , then that person would not be leading that army anymore . '' ` ` you quit yourinternship ? '' ` ` id id not like my boss . especially since i found out what ... ah em ... who he is . i did not have all the details before . feels like i was misled.that ' s a familiar feeling , cecil , '' she said , narrowing her eyes at me . ` ` at least you were just clueless . '' ` ` what ? '' said . ` ` never mind . '' ` ` maureen and have , like , a plan , '' said michelle . ` ` it ' s very secret , but we'reteaming up to save night vale . '' ` ` ah ! i ' m so glad you two have become such good friends , '' i said . they looked at each other , for a long moment . ` ` we do not want to , like , put a label on this , '' said michelle . ` ` not everything has to be named . '' ` ` yeah , '' saidmaureen . ` ` so , anyway , we have a secret plan . plus , chad is nowpanicking about what the thing he summoned has ended up doing , so he ' s been trying to figure out how to reverse the ritual . '' ` ` l.o.l. ! ` ` said michelle . ` ` l.o.l. ! ` ` agreed maureen , putting the lighter to the end of her cigarette and letting off a cloud of smoke that smelled like overlooked caramel . let ' s have a look now at the community calendar . all events thisweek are canceled . this week is also canceled . you might be canceled , too . this has been the community calendar . i found lucia , the ghost that haunts the haunted baseball diamond , looking sadly at the nearby shambling orphan housing development . the developmentsomehow has been hit even harder than the rest of night vale . there was almost nothing left to show that life had once existed there . ` ` ah , cecil ! ` ` she said . ` ` it is all happening as i was afraid it would . '' ` ` do you know how we can stop them ? '' i asked . ` ` no . i have no ideas . only the fear , a writhing biting thing within me . '' she slapped her special chest with her special hand , making a deepresonant pop . ` ` in here , cecil . '' she narrowed her eyes , and pointed . ` ` there ! thebes ! '' i saw , a few blocks away , a eagle puppy cross the street . ` ` the beast ? '' ` ` he is so adorable , yes ? just the cut est . so cut e that you would anything for his little face , for his dumb floppy ears , yes ? that is how he controls you . that is how he controls everyone . he is socute ! you would do just anything for him ! and you will . you will everything for him.things you never dreamed you would be capable of doing . ghastlythings . '' ` ` who ' s a goodby ? '' i said . ` ` who , indeed ? ` ` she said . i called carlosto see how far along he was in saving the day . he said that he wasn'tvery far along at all , and it was frustration to him . he said he'sbeen letting brightly colored liquid bubble in beakers , and he hasten writing numbers all over chalkboards , and it has not helpedanything at all . he even drew a structural formula for cyclohexane , but it also did not help . ` ` it'slike , '' he said , ` ` this is somehow a problem that ca not be solvedwith science , but there are no problems that ca not be solved with science ! science fixeseverything , and is always on the side of good ! i just ... i can'tfigure out what these strangers want ! they do not seem to wantanything ! '' ` ` you sound very upset , '' i told carlos . ` ` you know that it ' s not woodford you to get worked up like this . take a break . play somebloodborne , that ' ll relax you . '' ` ` okay , yeah , guess , '' he said , but i knew he did not mean it . he was going to keeptrying to save night vale , and i loved him for it , even as i wished would not be so hard on himself . and now , a wordforms our sponsors : it is possible the world is ending . if you can not hide , then you must run . if you cannot run , then you must die . this messagebrought to you by clorox bl each . two blocks pastmission grove park i saw the house of francis donelson , the manager of the antique mall . the door was off its hinges , the mail box had been killed and skinned , and for reasons i could not explain to myself crossed that ruined front yard and entered the house . i needed to see.i needed to report on this disaster . three feet intothe door i looked up to see a stranger before me . her shoulders went up and down , a deep , constant breathing . otherwise ... she did not move . at this distance i could see the pupils of her eyes , focused , frozen , on a point in the room several feet above my head . her hairs greasy , and it stuck to her face . her skin had faded into graylike a person dying , or a person carved from stone . she stood in the ruined living room , surrounded by a pattern of destruction thatsplashed out from her . the echo of a flurry of movement , even as shew as perfectly still . i was distracted by the mess . and when i looked back , she was muchcloser to me . i could ... i could feel her breath . it was room temperature , unchanged by her body . air in , air out , but no transformation . ` ` hello ... cecil , '' she said . her mouth did not move . her voice came not from her , but from a glass of water on a side table that had somehow been spared the destruction . the water vibrated slightly with the voice . ` ` hello ? '' said to the glass . ` ` what do you want ? '' the lamp hangingabove me laughed . there was no joy to it , just a application of the sound of laughter . it went on , and on , slowly peter ing out to a quietchoking , and then nothing . ` ` what ... do want ? '' asked the glass of water . ` ` i want ... nothing . '' ` ` nothing at all ? '' ` ` nothing . '' the lampsnickered . my left shoe joined in , and i jumped back , but the stranger was even closer than before . ` ` weyant ... nothing at all . everywhere there is ... something . all of thesethings , like ... this glass .

'' i recognized the stranger . behind the slack stillness there was a human face . it was francis herself , in the wreck age of her own home . ` ` francis ? whathappened to you ? '' at the sound of her name , her eyes focused in for a moment , and flicked down toward me , before drifting back up to the ceiling . ` ` i was made ... strange , '' the lamp said . ` ` so ... strange that i became ... stranger . there is a cavern . '' i merely looked the lamp , confused . ` ` there ... is ... a ... cavern ... ... cecil.i was ... taken ... there . the ground ... is covered ... in mud . you walk ... through ... the mud ... in ... the darkness ... because you think ... there must be ... something else ... but therein ... never ... anything ... else ... for years . you walk ... through ... the mud .

WTNV|Who's a Good Boy? Part 2|15 June 2016|you wan na go outside ? outside ? youwanna go outside ? you do ? you do ? i bet you want to go outside bet you do ! welcome to night vale . thebeagle puppy stood fully upright on his hind legs , breathing heavily inch ed back from the dog . here'swhere i want to tell you i drew a glowing sword , and he drew a swordmade of fire . i want to tell you our mighty blades clashed above our heads , as our elbows and faces met . i think it d be a really coolthing to say that i then pushed him back with a kick to the chest and swung my blade down upon him as he tried to deflect it with his own , my sword shatter ing his , causing him to burst open with white light and does , and order returned for good to night vale . but what i ' m going to tell you is ... i do not own a sword , does aren'treal , and the dog had destroyed everything we are without a singleconventional weapon . plus , i tripped while trying to run away . thebeagle was standing over me . there was a boom that dimmed my hearing , and the dog was jolted backwardviolently . sam , our sheriff , stood behind me , a shot gun in theirhand . ` ` common ! '' sam said as they grabbed my shoulder and pulled me up . turned back to see the carnage , but the eagle was standing again , exactly where he was the moment before ... perhaps a little closer , actually . his adorable puppy mouth distended horribly with eachlabored breath . ` ` don'tlook at it ! '' sam said as they pushed me into city hall and through door marked forbidden . sam slammed the door shut and bolted sherlock . we were in the city council ' s chambers . the council was there.they had not fled the city after all . they all spoke in unison , their black robesundulating like a storm-tossed ocean . the only details of the council ' s hood-shrouded faces i could discern were theirreddish-brown teeth . ` ` we have reopened the dog park ! '' the city council shouted . it soundedlike an accusation . ` ` sam plans to lure the strangers into the dog park and lock them away there . '' ` ` how–how do you ... how do you get them to go intothe dog park ? '' i asked . the council was silent for a long time , finally muttering , ` ` well , thereleader is a eagle , so ... '' and then trailing off . sam interjected . ` ` we get every person left in night vale in front that dog park . if they want nothing , they ' ll have to go there and create it . '' i was thinking about what ` ` nothing '' meant . about beings that don'texist . and who better to fight off a lord of hell than ... ` ` soundsgood , '' i said . ` ` is there a way out of here that does not through that eagle ? i need to visit a friend of mine . '' let'shave a look now at traffic . theresa metal grate , about 11 feet off the ground . it ' s large enough foremost human bodies to fit through . there are eight 10-millimeterhexagonal bolts holding it in place . sittingatop a person ' s shoulders who ' s sitting at op another person'sshoulders and then using a simple torque french , it is not difficult to remove these bolts and pull oneself through , into the duct work.the duct eventually ends at a similar large grate . thenthere is a 12-foot drop to the ground behind city hall next to adumpster . a car , driven by mayor dana cardinal , is there . then , thatch drives to old woman josie ' s house , out by the used car lot . thighs been traffic . ` ` ca ni speak to erika ? '' i said to old woman josie . ` ` whicherika ? '' she asked . ` ` all of them ! i need to speak with the angels . '' old woman josie winced . a couple miles off i heard the angel acknowledgesiren go off down by the fire house , but i was certain law enforcement was dealing with bigger problems than a radio host who happened to acknowledge an angel or two . therefore way more than two , though . ab right black light filled old woman josie ' s living room , illuminatingat least a dozen tall winged beings . dana and i shaded our eyes . my body mingled . i swore i could hear a cells , and smell confectioner'ssugar . danaand i explained the sheriff ' s plan to lure the strangers to the dog park . ` ` how do you lure something that wants nothing ? '' one of the elias asked . ` ` technicallywanting nothing is actually wanting something , '' one of the elias explained . ` ` we'renot having this argument with you again , erika ! '' another erikashouted . ` ` we just need to do something , '' i said . ` ` if what they want is nothing , then we must make sure that we are always doing something ! can you help us ? '' the black light grew painfully bright . i took that as a ` ` yes . '' let'shave a look now at today ' s horoscopes . theaters are silent . they have been absent from the sky for weeks now.they refuse to tell us anything . perhaps the silence is for our own protection . thighs been horoscopes . on the drive back to town with dana : ` ` know he tried to kill you , '' i said carefully . ` ` i know he is death row now for his crimes , but ... what if ? what if we made a deal ? '' danainterrupted . ` ` i ' m not offering hiram a deal . '' drove past the dark and empty radio station . i thought aboutkhoshekh , our station cat , who hovers four feet off the ground what used to be the men ' s restroom . oh , all of our restrooms areunisex now , which is great , because everyone can visit khoshekh ! he ' s been much happier with the extra attention , buzzing and licking visitors with his chesttongues ... but when i had last checked in on him , before we lost allowed to the radio station , he was ... gone . his kitten were alsogone . no sign of a fight , just gone . missed him . i miss the radio station . all over town no electricity , no gas , barely any drinkable water . i – i ... i could smell distantsmoke . the sky was completely gray , even though there was not single cloud . danasaid , ` ` i ' ll talk to hiram , cecil . i ' ll find out if he knowsanything about the strangers , and if he could be of some help . bu ti ' m not cutting a deal with him . '' we pulled up to a mob of about 50 people . in the front was the sheriff , hand in hand with a woman in long yellow robes and a wide rectangular hat . i recognized the medallion on the front of her chest . she was one of the leaders from the joyous congregation of the smiling god the church that most of desert bluff and a few night vale residentsbelong to . in the crowd i saw john peters – you know , the farmer ? – and alsojohn peter – remember , the pharmacist ? i saw tamika lynn and her teenage militia . in tamika ' s left hand was sarah sultan , who is afist-sized river rock and current president of the night valecommunity college . around them were many faces i didn'tknow . former desert bluff residents , i could see it in their eyes . danaand i got out of the car and joined them . a prayer march against common enemy . how strange mankind is that two cities , night vale and desert bluff , could hate each other so much ... another hold hands so tightly in mutual hatred of something else . we marched toward the center of town , chanting prayers . i have neverbeen a believer in the smiling god , so some of the ch ants were new to me , but a lot of them were similar to recitations , verses , and prayers common across most religions . basic stuff like ` ` please , god , destroy our enemies , amen , '' some really long gurgling sounds , and one chant that sounded identical to an old prayer i was taught intra school , where everyone just shouts , ` ` defense ! defense ! ` ` while clapping in rhythm . our crowd grew . we saw strangers on the street , not moving , justbreathing and watching . we were nearing a thousand , our mob , feelinginvincible ! united to save our town , a town we all loved and believed in , matter how long each of us had lived there . carlosjoined , along with my sister abby , her husband steve , and my youngniece janice . i was worried for their safety out here , surrounded by the strangers , but i was also worried for their safety at home , hidingfrom the strangers . i was worried for their safety always and everywhere . our huge crowd stopped near the dog park . there were hooded figures in the dog park . the gates were open . they are ... rarely open . we looked at the strangers . their numbers had grown as well , an equalmotionless mob to our heaving praying one . being at the front of the crowd , i could feel the steady breath of the stranger directly in front of me . they were not dead . they were not undead.they were ... nothing . i was afraid of dying , of becoming one of them , of existing only in the dark wet cavern . francis ' voice in my head : ` ` i ' m still in the mud ! i ' m still in the mud ! '' annals her voice from right in front of me suddenly , at the front of the crowd of strangers , eyes wild as though struggling against the complete stillness of the rest of her body , screaming , '' i ' m ... still ... in the mud ! i ' m still ... in ... the mud ! '' the crowd of strangers parted , although none of us saw them move , revealing the eagle puppy on his hind legs , his front paws danglingcrookedly against his chest . the breathing was not coming from the dog , but from behind ! i turned to see sheriff sam , their jaw hanging limp and open , the dog ' s breath came from their mouth ! ` ` whose good boy ? '' said the voice coming from sam ` ` whose good boy ? '' ` ` ami the good boy ?

'' and held him tight . janice , abby , and carlos all put their arms around him too , trying to hold him in place , keep him from being taken to the cavern , helping him to resist the pull of dark and muddy hell dragging at him from within . we heard a sound above us , like wings . manywings . we looked up and saw all of the elias curling above . ` ` therefore angels ! ` ` said janice in awe . no one corrected her . there was also the sound of a different kind of wing . not angelic.reptilian . we saw the five heads of hiram mcdaniels , four of therewith prison track ing collars . fire speed from hiram ' s mouth , and fo ra moment the gray cloudless sky shone blue . an di finally noticed , in the heart of all this fear and tempest , howcalmthe weather was . no , not calm . the weather was ... it was ... ... nightmare , we have power once again ! we have electricity , and water , i'mback on the air ( ! ) , and many of you are back in your homes . the strangers and the dogs are gone ! defeated ... question mark . francis , sam , steve , those who were taken , or who were about to be taken , all humans once again . bu there ' s where we run into the problem of my narrative , because ... id o not know what caused it to happen ! our crowd had chant ed and prayed , i – i ' m not a religious person , mostly , but i do think we had an impact , driving away that thingsummoned from the dark wet caverns of hell . and even if it wasn'tthe blood stones , or the joyous congregation ' s smiling god , or another kind of god , theme re spiritual coming together of so many people may have been enough to rid the town of this hound and his army . but then , inter kareem reported that khoshekh is back in the stationrestroom . khoshekh was badly scratched up , as though he had been in great battle , and kareem noticed that inside khoshekh ' s second row teeth was a small piece of fur-covered flesh . kareem thought it was apiece of a dog ' s ear . is khoshekh our hero ? janicesays tamika lynn drove away the strangers with her militia ofbook-loving children . abby and steve told janice she ' s still too young to join a militia , and tamika ' s running drills out in the desert and will not comment on what happened . old woman josie claimed the angels used their powers of heavenly good to push back the brazen evil of the eagle . who else can destroy creature of hell , other than angels ? maybe that'strue ... if you believe in angels . which you are not allowed to do . melonypennington , celebrated computer programme , managed to get the powerutilities back on , and claims that with the help of young prodigymeghan allay , she wrote a deadlycomputer virus to bring down the strangers . i ' m not really an expert on programming , but i feel like you need a computer to catch computer virus . what ? oh . um , kareem is telling me you don'tanymore . computerviruses are totally air borne . huh ! wo w ! technology ! sheriff sam and the city council claimed their plan to lure the strangers to the dog park worked perfectly , and the strangers were rounded up and locked away . sam also added , ` ` now that the situation is undercontrol , the dog park is no longer open . '' and then they folded anorigami sea urchin , elaborate thin spines and everything . ` ` yeah , no , it ' s off limits once again , '' sam said . michelleand maureen , over at dark owl records , claimed they were playing copy of beyond ' s newest album , the follow up to lemonade – an album no one else has heard . according to michelle , the strangerswanted to hear that album quite badly , and this human desire filled the hollow that these years in the mud had carved in them , turningthem back into non-strangers , into friends . michelle and maureenclaim to be the real heroes , or ... whatever . asked michelle if could hear the album , and she said no , because beyond asked her to stop playing it . ` ` beyoncécalled you ? ` ` i asked , astonished that michelle knew such a famous musician . ` ` well ... her lawyers called , '' michelle said . ` ` they were really angry , and alsoconfused and scared , because beyond has not actually written or recorded the album yet . '' chad , my former inter who summoned the eagle in order to destroy the world government , says that methinks the reversal of his summoning worked . he is no hero , he says , but perhaps he is not a villain either . ` ` he'spretty okay , i guess , '' maureen said . ` ` at least i got myinternship credit . '' another there was hiram mcdaniels ' brave fighting against the strangers.if anything was more powerful than our coming together as a town , twas the brute force of a 18-foot-tall dragon with five heads . he fought valiantly for a town he had once threatened , a town who had recently condemned him to death . and we all saw his bravery , and we all knew that he must be pardoned . ` ` pardon him !

' i and then keptwalking toward the back of the line , '' wayne said , ` ` but i keptpassing charlie . morning , charlie ! ' i said each time . eventually , she let me cut in line . '' waynesaid the line collapses back on itself . there is no beginning or end , even though it appears to be perfectly straight . more and more people are joining the line just to find out what everyone is in line for . wayneadded , ` ` whatever we ' re waiting for must be pretty cool ! '' you have to admire such childlike optimism , even though optimism doomed to almost certain disappointment and/or injury . we have more on the 12:37 train to red me sa . dozens of volunteers havearrived to take series in front of the old-timey steam engine . annals to weep in terror at the sudden anachronism . sheriff sam applaud ed these civic-minded helper by settling them into small chicken wire pen and shouting at them with an electricbullhorn . sheriff sam , as part of the police investigation into this mysterious train , constructed a wrought iron abstract statue seemingly depicting a birddevouring a snake . we think it ' s supposed to symbolized man ' s inhumanity to man , and the frightfulconditions in which immigrants were exploited in the building of our nation ' s railways . also , the iron construction surelyrepresents the indomitability of american capitalism , but anyone who looks directly at any form of art gets a headache , and trying understand art is usually fatal , so no one is certain . uh , how did the train get here with no tracks ? where did it comefrom ? and now that there ' s a giant metal sculpture in its way , howwible it leave ? how much would a ticket even be in today ' s dollars ? who are the people gathering about the baseballfields wearing deer masks ? oh.breaking news . some people wearing deer masks are gathering by the train , distributing reaches to bystanders . the reaches all havephrases printed on them , things like ` ` business in the front , knife the back '' and ` ` # notalltrains . '' weird . listeners , your guess is as good as mine . well , almost . i ' m pretty good guessing things . and now , traffic . you are driving on a foggy night . there are faint taillights from a car in front of you . there are also faint head lights from a car behind you , all moving at a steady 30 miles per hour . but then the lights of the other cars just switch off , at the same time.are the other cars still there ? it ' s too foggy to see . should you slow down ? speed up ? if you slow down , the car behind might hit you.if you speed up , you might hit the car in front . best to stay at 30. but your speedometer is creeping up to 35. the pressure has put you on edge . your boss , catherine , has been really on your case lately , andy ou ' re pressing your foot down without realizing . now you ' re at 40. should you go back to 30 ? what if the cars are stillthere , match ing your speed ? is going back to 30 safe ? should you stay at 40 ? wait ... it's50 now . you ' ve been so worried about driving at 40 and lingering what catherine said to you about terrible quarter two sales , yourspeed has crept up again . you imagine three cars speeding through the night , all of you mere inchesaway from a bone-crunching , life-changing , possibly life-endingcollision , before you know it you ' re doing 60 , then 70 , then 80 . 80 ! you can scarcely believe it . i mean , was not that tina'saccount and not yours that failed ? how is quarter two your fault ? you ca not possibly slow down now.the car behind wo not have time to reduce their speed . and where is the car in front of you ? at least the road is straight ... or is it ? and , are you even still on the road ? is there any way to know ? all around you is fog . if you crash , even if you survive , will anyonefind the wreck age to save you ? withoutnoticing , you have lifted your foot and the car has slowed down to 60 . you keep your foot off the gas , and your car keeps slowing .50 ... 40 ... 30 ... 20 ... 10 ... and then zero . you have stopped . no crash es , no stretching tires . output on the parking brake and get out of your car , and walk off intothe mist , your face tight and tear-stained . you think about how tinatakes such long smoke breaks , and catherine does not say a thing aboutthat . chemist coats your cold skin , and you hear birds just above you . thighs been traffic . we have an exciting update from the baseball fields ! the train has opened its doors . nobody has dis embarked yet . it lookscompletely empty . the secret police are keeping a safe distance whilepolitely shouting at the settled witnesses to board the train and somewhat ' s up . a few are reluctantly going in . the figures in deer masks , looking like the same transit lovers who built the night vale subways system three years ago , are in an inverted formation out in left center field , their shoulders and heads bobbingas if in silent laughter . so far , none of the ... u mm ... '' volunteers '' ... have come back out , despite the sheriff ' s secret police ' s repeated friendly warnings and helpful bullion threats . the city council could not be reached for comment on the train , as thiswhole situation has unfortunately clashed with their annual ( and inaugural ) charity golf tournament , somewhere far away from any possible danger . also , i did not even bother to call them for comment . teddywilliams , owner of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , announced that after 20 years , the laser tag adventure pit is reopening this weekend . in a contrive statement released thisweek , teddy says he finally figured out how to lower the powersettings on the layers . according to williams ' written statement , ` ` super sorry , like wo w , it neveroccurred to me that ... anyway , things are fine now . also , i know doctor who specialized in limb attachment , '' the statement reads . restatement continued , ` ` like , spiders with eight legs can afford to lose a few , right ? but us humans , with just the two ? crap ! really , what was i thinking ? sorry . i mean , nobody died or anything , '' teddy said , ` ` and i apologized , did not i ? but ceciljust gets on the radio , reading out stories in that condescending wayne does , putting on silly voices , making a mockery of my punctuation and vernacular prose , turning everything into an incredibly longsentence with a lot of sub-clauses and agents that wander out , likebranching paths in a forest , so that when you take one for king pat hand then it turns into another path you do not know if it ' s a new pathos just the same path you were already on , or maybe you ' ve just gone in a circle , and anyway the whole quote takes so long to say that you forget it ' s somebody else ' s words until he says teddy said ' , '' teddy said . well.listeners , i ... do not think i need to read the rest of his statement.but i will mention that for reopening weekend at the laser tag adventure pit , there ' s a 20 % discount on admission , and everyone gets release form absolutely free ! update from the baseball fields : the sheriff ' s secret police boarded the train , and did not come back out . shortly before they boarded , they warned the remaining witnesses not to board the train . then , shortly after the secret police boarded , the witnesses themselvesboarded the train ... and also did not come back out . manypeople have been seen leaving their homes , schools , and places business to walk toward the station , all excited to take series andros in existential horror at this rift in not only time and space , but also our trust in basic physics . the figures in the deer masks are all crouched , pound ing the ground withtheir open palms . therefore now more people on the train than its capacity for passengers , but people are still boarding , effortlessly disappearing inside.night vale is emptying.everyone wants to board the train . i ... feel the same urge that all of you do to board the train , listeners , and if it were not for my strict professional ism and commitment to this show , i would be on that train myself . but i must resist . i willstay here in my studio ... and ... you know what ? never mind . yeah . uh-huh . i got ta go see this . okay . uh , let ' s just go to the weather . listeners , i am back . i am back in the radio booth . the12:37 train to ... wherever ( certainly not to red me sa ) is gone . as the doors closed on us inside the passenger cars , we heard the thrumming of the massive engine , the churning of gears and wheels , great steam whistle . looking out the windows i saw the baseballdiamond , i saw houses and trees , i felt us moving , gaining speed , accelerating . i felt it in my ears . but the cars , trees , houses , thebaseball fields , did not seem to move at all ... at first . then the trees withdrew into the ground . the houses disassembledthemselves . distant power poles and tall buildings vanished . therefore more plants , more water , the grass grew up higher and higheruntil the baseball fields were merely imprint on my eyelids . the clouds moved more and more rapidly . i saw the sun curl across the skyline a pop fly ti right , i saw it over and over . the firmament pulsedblue . and orange . and black . and yellow . blue , and orange , and black , and yellow , blue and orange and black and yellow , faster and faster , flickering dark and light , flicked dark and light , a disorientingstrobing inside our passenger car . in the millisecond darkness i saw empty seats all around . in themillisecond lightness es , seated about me were all of my fellow nightmare citizens . these two realities simultaneous and overlaid . at the front of the car , visible only in the rapid flashes of dark , stood a woman wearing a deer mask . sheltered straight into me , walking slowly , stumbling every couple steps – not clumsily , but deliberately , a painful and grotesquedance . she seemed to lose control of her whole body , only to recovergracefully ... and repeat . she stopped , inches from me . i could see her body was covered withroaches . she said , ` ` they take our miniature buildings . they put them in crates , and deliver them to warehouses across the desert . their interests arefurthered . it could not be more terrible .

WTNV|If He Had Lived|15 August 2016|which came first – the chicken , thee , or airplane ? welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . this week is national alternate history week , in which we celebrate our richhistory that could havehappened , if what actuallyhappened didn'thappen . the night vale historical society sorts through the localsubmissions , and the best story gets placed into the elementaryschool curriculum . it ' s a fun activity that helps boost creativityand obfuscate the past . today , for my version of history , i will be looking at the kennedyassassination and trying to answer the question , ` ` what if he had lived ? '' well , here ' s a start . would have eaten lunch . did you know he was on his way to a lunchwhen he was killed ? he was ! he was probably hungry . if he had lived , he would have eaten – big bites full of gusto . laterthat day he would have gone to austin . he would have breathed deep , healthy breaths . probably would have been reflected if he lived . sure ! handsomecharismatic guy like that ? four more years ! no london johnson ( orlando johnson would , as far as i know , continue to exist – but president johnson ) without the pressure of having to win another term , perhaps he wouldhave pulled us out of vienna in ‘ 66 or ' 67 , saving countless lives and forever altering the cultural and artistic landscape of the late'60s and early '70s . our art would be different , there would be more of us , and he would go on living . jackiekennedy would feel no grief . she would never have to feel griefagain . she would stand , age less and smiling , on bandstands , stages , waving , her smile distant ( not even a smile , but performance of as mile ) , waving , on bandstands , on stages , griefless , waving , age less , smiling . more on our story of ` ` if he had lived '' soon . but first , the news . know that some of our listeners were worried about the beatrix lowmanmemorial meditation zone , that state-of-the-art ( and enormouslyexpensive ) institution that reopened this spring . there was concernthat the meditation zone may have been damaged or even destroyed at the attack by the evil eagle and his army of un moving strangers thatnearly erased our town from the map just a couple months ago . but the good news is that the meditation zone is entirely damaged , and it is ready for you to meditate in . what tragedy it would have been to lose such an important aspect of our community ! and also , how frustration it would have been , given thatlarge parts of our city government were facing huge budget shortfallswhile more and more city money was heaped on the rebuilding of throne . all of that money for nothing ! but no , the zone still stands ! celebrate by coming on down to the beatrixlowman memorial meditation zone , and hook ing yourself up into one of the state-of-the-art meditation machines that will have you calm and harvested in no time at all . what a stress reliever ! the national weather service has released a statement saying that the thunderstorms that have been going continuously for the last severalmonths to the west of night vale might not be thunderstorms , but instead the movements of the terrible court of the distant prince.they explained that when warm , moist air enters a low pressuresystem , sometimes it does so around the barely-understood ( andall-powerful ) distant prince , flanked by his harbingers and served by the court shriekers , the mangled servants , and the hollow-eyedweepers – all of which would result in some lightning , thunder , and of course , localised atrocities . it'salso possible that they ' re just some particularly persistentthunderstorms . either way , the weather service said , ` ` best to justavoid the area entirely . because being struck by lightning , or beingskinned alive by the mangled servants , are both real and deadlythreats that should be avoided . '' the year is 1973. penned had not died , and is finishing his third german embargo in somewhere called the ` ` middle east '' results in soaring gas prices . but the confidence america has for theirpresident is high . he saw us through many other crises – including the cuban missile crisis in 1962 , the svitz-franchia stand off of 1967 , and the rise of the blood space war in 1971. we wait in loneliness at gas stations , but he comes by to each gas station – thousands gas stations at once , multiplying himself as he has learned to do , and smiling at us , and we feel at ease . broke , but at ease . continues as president through the turbulence of the '70s and intothe '80s . a topic is made of his life , starring the mid-level moviestar donald began ( who will soon be washed up and entering hislate-life career of narrating commercial for frozen food and insurance ) . the movie does not even mention dallas . nothing happened dallas , except a short drive to lunch . this is mostly what happens in dallas . paulsimon re leases his classic album graceland.it is about the time that president penned visited grassland in 1982 . the album is a huge flop due to its limited subject matter andaural motif of pained moans and lawnmower engines . jackiekennedy has not aged . in fact , she appears youngerthan before . at night , she walks among the monuments in d.c. , serene and alone , not even a secret service escort with her . anyone worries to approach finds themselves pushed back by a faint mist thatsmells of apple and spice , and feels like thousands of needles.witnesses claim her feet are not even touching the ground . her armsseem longer than they used to , as though they were the only part of her body continuing to change . ifjfk had lived , listeners , ` ` if he had lived . '' more soon . first , this . remember the phases of the moon : new , crescent , quarter , fibrous , gelatinous , full , very full , swirling , angry , un sure of itself , mad with power , disappointed in the newest marvel movie , very veryfull , feeling like an impostor , jealous toward the sun , being entrance to the sun to make up for the jealousy the sun is unaware of , trying to sabotage the sun ' s happiness but only succeeding insabotaging its own happiness , and finally new again . thighs been the children ' s fun fact science corner . and now , a word from our sponsors . sometimes you are on the precipice , the moment where everything could topple.maybe it is danger , or a hard choice , or just change ( which is , incur perception , the biggest danger of all ) . and sometimes we are on the smooth flats , where everything is stable , and the precipice is just a tickle in the back of the back of our minds . but deep down , we know the truth . we see it sometimes , driving at nightthrough a rainstorm , or when the phone rings at the wrong hour , or when the plane starts to shake , there are no smooth flats . it ' s all precipice . always . and sometimes we are facing the precipice , and sometimes we are turnedaway . but it is always there , and we are always entering . and maybe the fall is not even the worst part . maybe , when we fall , therein at least the relief that we know we ' re falling . no moreuncertainty . maybe the worst part is the entering , the entering for years and years . deltaairlines : it ' s not like you ' re safe anywhere else . thighs been a word from our sponsors . the year is this year . the day is today . the time is now . presidentkennedy calls a press conference . his salt-and-pepper hair is neatlycombed , his hands are steady . he has been president for decades . he opens the conference by issuing a warm birthday message to cinematictreasure lee margin . mr . margin turns 30 today , and is perhaps the nation ' s most beloved performer . thispleasantry aside , the president announced that we have a gravenational problem that must be addressed . he then said surname several times , and shuddered for five silent minutes . an aideshowed some pictures of you , while the president pointed at themsaying , ` ` here we see the problem . '' finally said your name again , visibly blanched , and said , ` ` right ? right ? '' congresswidely agreed with the president ' s message , and several bills wereintroduced with the goal of solving the problem that is you . jackiekennedy had no comment . not only had she never felt grief , it seemed her that she had not felt anything at all since that day she had lunch in dallas . it was as though some real human part of herself had experienced something so intense , and sincere , that all feelings had diverged from this false version of herself , leaving her hollow . it had been an okay lunch . the president complained of headache . he was experiencing more and moreau the years went on . continuation on our story soon . if , hypothetical , angels existed – which , legally , of course , i can not say that they do – but it they did , then the angels would have let me know that old woman josie fell in her gardening broke her hip this week . the hypothetical angels ( who are allayed ... oh , let ' s say erika ) said that she is fine and in goodspirits , but will have to spend a few days in the hospital . they area little worried about that , since the hospital is abarely-understood and terrible place , where doctors lurk and nursesflit from patient to patient . rumors it that on the dark est night of the dark est month , if you stand in just the rightplace , you can see ghost ambulance carrying ghost patients into the ghost ear . – which is the best and most up-to-date ghost ear . in the region , much better even than the ghost ear . available over in pine cliff ( the town nearby that is entirely populated by ghosts ) . pinecliff residents often come to our hospital for treatment , rather thangoing to their understaffed and undefended ghost hospitality ' s ... it ' s just not right , them straining our resources and takingaway medical attention from our own localghosts instead of fixing the ghost problems in their own ghost city . anyway , here ' s wishing a quick recovery to my good friend old woman josie . sounds like a painful slip , but hopefully the sheer desire to escapea place as baffling and terrifying as a hospital will help her pushthrough her recovery as soon as possible . back to ` ` if he had lived . '' the year is 2080. coastal cities all over the world are succumbing to theater that had long sustained them – the basic elements of eachcity , like streets and burgher shacks , slowly disappearing below these foam . the eighth siege of the great night vale temple rages on . the schon of the dark order makes his prophesied appearance at the exact correctprophesied time ( after several false starts where he had arrived too early and had to leave again ) . presidentkennedy offers a steady hand to the nation , even as his belovedmassachusetts is swallowed by the rising seas . he broker a deal with the sino-soviet superstate that provides safe passage for the masses climate refugees , and also those fleeing the shrouded armies of the dark order . he addresses the country with inspiring words thatpeople will remember for decades afterwards . ` ` these levels will not rise another inch . instead , the american peoplewill rise to meet the sea levels .

WTNV|Big Sister|1 September 2016|find it in your heart . you ' ll need to break past the ribs , and then scoop it out . but it ' s in there , andy ou need to find it . quickly . welcome to night vale . start the news today , there ' s a bake sale this saturday afternoon at night vale elementary . this is to raise money for a new sculpture honor the great contributions made by the current school boardpresident , the glow cloud . th eglow cloud is mighty and magnificent ! all hail the powerful gowingcloud which rules our every desire , our every action , our veryexistence ! all hail that which did not create us , but can certainlydestroy us . the sculpture will serve as a physical manifestation of our felty to the benevolent ( yet oppressive ) cloud , who has helped increasestandardized test scores at every school , as well as granulation rates at night vale high . the glow cloud ( all hail ! ) also helped to build a brand new fine arts center and rehearsal studies for musicprograms at the junior high , so good work ! well deserved . unrelated news , several five-headed dragons have been seen aroundnight vale . night vale ' s most famous five-headed dragon ( really the only dragon we know insight vale ) is hiram mcdaniels , who is currently in prison , slatedfor execution for his attempt to kill mayor dana cardinal . none these new dragons are hiram , but they ' re all five-headed and quitelarge . myintern kareem reports that the apparent leader of these new diagnosis hadassah mcdaniels , hiram ' s sister . not sure what their intentions are , but ... i bet they ' re innocuous . just some dragons passingthrough ! kareemargues that their intentions seem rather sinister . for instance , theynearly burned down the pinkberry by the mall . you know , a few weeks ago i asked for mo chi on my order at thatpinkberry , and they put crushed peanuts on it , as if anybody likes that garage ? so , i do not know . innocuous , sinister ... six one way , half a dozen the other , 1.5 times 4 another way . listeners , can i just take a moment to thank our intrepid inter kareem ? he'sbeen at the station for a long time , a dedication few of our internshave ever shown . in fact , most radio interns leave in the first few weeks , never to be heard from again . not kareem ! he ' s truly loyal to this station and to his radio dreams . i think he ' ll have a longcareer ahead of him . hata ! kareem is cocking his head and raising one eyebrow at me . kind of aface-based thumbs-up , i suppose . ha ! you ' re welcome , kareem ! let'shave a look now at sports . the night vale high school scorpions kick off their season this fridaynight at memorial stadium against the pine cliff liza rd monitors.night vale ' s new quarter back , sophomore mallory walsingham , won the starting job over junior henry lexington , who really struggled lastyear with some of the basic concepts of throwing ... like which arm to use . in the season final last december , lexington brought a third arm he found in the vacant lot out back of the ralph ' s . he used that arm throw for five touchdowns in a victory over the stone meadow sharknurses . but even with this impressive final , coach nazr al-mujaheedsaid he preferred the consistency walsingham brought to the position . ` ` willinghamhas great vision ! '' coach al-mujaheed said , while crouching behind large cardboard box in the corner of his office . ` ` she can seething no one else can ! '' the coach screamed , his body quivering . ` ` she can see your soul , right into it ! ` ` he whispered , while still screaming . ` ` she'scoming ! hide ! she ' s coming ! '' he said , suddenly , as he barricaded his office by hammering wood planks over the door . willinghamsounds like just what this team needs to make the play off once again . timlangley , head of the night vale chapter of the n ra , announced todaysome changes to their charter , saying that , from now on , the n ra will no longer use the words gun , rifle , pistol , semi-automatic , revolver . instead , those words ( and related words ) will be replaced the word ` ` kitten . '' as in ` ` kitten do not kill people , peoplekill people '' and ` ` going down , kitten blazing '' and ` ` well , if you ' re holding a kitten to my head ... '' langleysaid the word ` ` gun '' carries too many negative consolations , while the word ` ` kitten '' does not . langley stressed the importance positive language when attempting to rally a public behind organization with such monstrous political beliefs . langleyand the n ra then distributed flyers across town that read , ` ` don'tlet the government take our kitten ! '' which caused several excitedresidents to call city hall . they demanded to know whether the government truly planned to come to their homes and take away theirkittens . because , the residents said , their cat just had a bunch ofkittens , and they ' re having trouble finding homes for them . so , if the government wants to take some kitten , please , by all means , come to our house and take them ! thirteen excited the members of the city council , who apparently eatkittens . they rushed out , answering every call for kitten . but then , upon seeing that many of the residents who had kitten also had guns in their homes , well the city council ordered the guns removed . ` ` yeah , we ' ve lost our appetite for kitten , '' the council snarled unison . ` ` we ' re now entering every home in night vale and takingaway your guns . update on the dragons : kareemscored a prison interview with hiram mcdaniels . hiram ' s gold , green , blue , and gray heads have been sentenced to death for trying to killmayor cardinal . according to kareem , hiram has been shackled inside large stone room . just outside his barred window , hiram can see prison guards inflating colourful year balloons that read , ` ` execution day '' and ` ` congress '' and ` ` lord , lord , guess who ' s 40 ? ` ` – but ` ` 40 ? '' has been crossed out and replaced with ahand-written ` ` being terminated ! '' his violet head will be spared , since he did not participate in the attack on the mayor – and , in fact , thwart ed the assassinationattempt . just last month , hiram ' s violet head received the sheriff'sblack heart medal for bravery and service to the community . sheriff sam himself pinned it right onto violet ' s thick scaly skin . kareemreports that in spite of his pending execution , hiram is in goodspirits . hiram ' s gold head told kareem , ` ` son , i ' m not worried . i'vegot some plans in the works . some really smart plans . '' then hiramwinked four times , with one eye on each of his hour heads up for execution . violet did not wink , only lowered , saying , ` ` it ' ll never work ! the government will find out ! '' hiram'sgreen head snarled , ` ` complaining is not a strategy ! we needsolution-based contributions ! '' kareemasked hiram if these plans involved inviting his sister and all the other dragons into town . hiram went silent . ` ` now ... now , that ' s not it at all ! '' his gold head replied . ` ` that'snot logical ! it makes no sense for her to be here , '' hiram ' s blushed stated . ` ` nightmare is doomed , but i am too , so who cares ? '' his gray headconcluded . more on this as it develops . but first , a word from our sponsor . drawa entangle on your wall . make it a big entangle , wider than it is tall . put it at eye level , across from your sofa . then color it in , all black . a big , black entangle on your wall . nowerase the black coloring and then draw a picture – let ' s say , jonathan fill ion from the to show castle.next to him , draw the actor molly qu inn , who plays his daughteralexis on the show . godlike castle . it ' s good show . let ' s say it ' s your favorite scene from castle where richard alexis reconcile their differences after an important court case . so , they ' re talking to each other . rick is about to say , ` ` i ' m sorry . '' okay.got that ? now , era se that and draw the same scene again , only they'vemoved ever-so-slightly rick is just beginning to open his mouth now . gott ? good . noerase that and do it again , rick ' s mouth slightly more open as begins the first sound of the word ` ` i ' m . '' maybe draw alexisgently lowering her eyes to receive his statement , still a bit unsureabout what is to come . keeping that : easing and re drawing frame by frame , each fraction of second , until you have fully animated the scene . timeconsuming , is not it ? perhaps you should get a samson smart to . we'llflicker all these images and stories at you without you even having move ! no offense , but we ' re much faster at it than you are . also , na than fill ion looks nothing like that . did you think we said nathanlane ? i mean , he ' s a talented actor too , but he was never on castle . were you thinking of modern family ? we bet you werethinking of modern family samsung.stop drawing on your wall ! internkareem says he has seen hadassah in downtown near city hall , accompanied by several other multi-headed dragons . she ' s a full ten feet taller than hiram , and like hiram , hadassah has exactly foreheads . but instead of being several different colors , each are green.each one shouts simultaneously ( overlapping , though ; not in unison ) , '' bring me my brother ! '' and ` ` i will crush your human skull in my claws ! '' and ` ` that ' s not a knife , thesis a knife ! '' and then , arc ing toward the sky , a great breath office – which kareen said did not resemble a knife at all . rustan aside , listeners , kareem has always been a bit of a cynic . he used say he did not think hiram mcdaniels was not really a five-headeddragon , but an elaborate metaphor i made up for a dangerous man . strange point of view for a young man who openly acknowledges the existence of angels , so ... i hope he understands now that hadassah ' s knife comment was a metaphor . the dragons themselves are a liberality . anyway , it ' s good that these young interns get a chance to see the world for themselves , rather than just in textbook and classroom . i do hopethat kareem is getting a lot lot out of the – ... an di just got word from kareem that he thinks he broke his ankle diving out of the way of hadassahs ' s flaming breath as she stormed towardscity hall . id o not use metaphor lightly , kareem . dragons are real , young man ! mayor cardinal and sheriff sam have appeared on the steps of city hall . kareem , who is trying ti maintain consciousness in the face of cripplingpain , says they are confronting hadassah directly . dana is extending open palm as a welcoming show of peace . sam is clenching theirshotgun and shouting at the dragons , ` ` keep your wig on , you overgrown salamanders ! '' behindthem , a large cloud – glowing and rumbling , dropping dead animals.all hail ! a few of the dragons are whispering upon seeing the cloudapproach . but not hadassah . danais waving a hand to both sam and the glow cloud to stand down , bu thedragons are closing in on her . listeners , has hadassah come to finish what hiram started ? i told kareem to get out of there ( but also to get closer to the action – really try to get that story ) but also to gt very far away . awe wait to learn dana ' s fate , let me take you know to the weather . kareemhas gotten himself to the hospital to get his ankle looked at . seems ' ll need to be in a cast for a few weeks , but fortunately , before passed out from the pain , he managed to get a report of whathappened at city hall . mayor cardinal stepped toward hadassah and welcomed her to the city . danawas cautious , and graceful . hadassahsneered at sam and their shot gun , until dana told sam to lower thereupon . hadassah screamed at dana , ` ` we do not come in peace . we com with lawyers ! '' thenseveral of the dragons behind her reached fire into the sky ... apparently in agreement ? or to signal that they were the lawyers ? or perhaps they saw some idiot bird fly too close to them ? hadassahintroduced her cousin , miriam adleman , and two of her close friends , ta ra cartridge and george andrews , who are all lawyers brought thereto discuss the imprisonment and threatened execution of the citizen of their world . sam said , ` ` you ' re not welcome here , '' and then , to sympathize theirpoint , craft ed a papier-mâché horn-of-plenty filled withartichokes . hourslater , after sam finished the sculpture , dana said , ` ` but you are welcome here ! we welcome all people ! '' hadassahsaid , ` ` we are not people ! '' danadisagreed . ` ` you are sentiment , you have cares , you have families and careers , and community . you love and you fear others . i respect you and you respect me , because we are all people , even if we are not all human or dragon . respect does not need to include ` ` getting alongwith '' or ` ` fully understanding , '' but simply acknowledging thatthose things are possible . because of sovereignty and sentience.because we respect people as people , you are welcome in night vale . '' there was a long silence . then , sheriff sam slapped their forehead and groaned . ` ` what are you doing , mayor ? this is a blinking disaster ! '' th eglow cloud shrunk away , disappointed ( or scared ... or possibly bored , or something ) . it ' s hard to tell exactly how clouds feel just by looking at them . danaand sam argued over how welcome the dragons were until hadassahroared , ` ` thank you mayor ! '' and miriam agreed . her beige headsaying , ` ` this will do nicely . i ' ll find ourselves a suitableextended-stay hotel . miriam'smaroon head said , ` ` i normally do not trust humans , but ... she seemskind . miriams'spurple head uttered , ` ` kindness and trust are not related . '' danaand the dragons shook hands/claws , as did sam ( although reluctantly ) . hadassahshouted , ` ` we begin negotiations next week ! '' so it looks like we have some new residents in night vale ! i reallyappreciate dana and her openness to people from all backgrounds.she ' s one of the kindest and most fair people i know . i can not think of a better mayor . but , given what happened to kareem today , i ' m worried about the violentnature of dragons . not that they ' ll intentionally destroy us , necessarily , but just the physical destruction that comes with beings dozen times your size . oh , kareem just tested me , by the way . i guess he ' s listening to the showright now from the hospital . he says , ` ` when elephants dance , the grass gets trampled . '' hmm.kareem sounds confused . there are no elephants in town , and everylittle grass , so ... you know what ? i ' m going to text kareem back and explain to him what an elephant is . i mean , he may not know . staytuned next for the sound of distant drums and cannons . an das always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : drive it like you stole it , but you stole it because you really loved it , and you wouldn like to see it damaged . basically , drive carefully .

have you moved somewhere else ? listen to the new set of sounds available you . do you hear one specific sound above the rest ? good ! cityofficials believe that sound is safe . move toward that sound . wonderful.you are doing great ... is something it would be good to believe austin case you die right now . that way you ' ll die thinking somethinghappy . gets close to the sound as possible . do you feel safer near it ?

WTNV|Zookeeper|1 October 2016|it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a cursed salesman must be in want of a he x reversal . welcome to night vale . night vale , we have a special treat for you today . joanna re y , head zookeeper at the night vale z oo , joins us live in studio . she ' s also brought in several animals for us to see . since this is radio , if you are not a telepath or an omnipresent spirit , you wo not be able to see them . you ' ll just have to imagine the animals , but that should not be difficult . as the old saying goes , ` ` a thousand words is worth a picture . '' so today ' s show should be worth about 2.6 pictures . you will also be able to en vision 2.6 animals during today ' s show . cecil : joanna , welcome to our program . joanna : thanks for having me ! cecil : i can see you brought in some really interesting what are those , raccoons ? joanna : these are chickens . cecil : oooh ! joanna : one of the evolutionary defensive traits of the chicken is its resemblance to the laocoon . for instance , both animals have two eyes and antennae , and like the laocoon , the chicken is mortal , which is a term geologists use to describe animals that eventually die . cecil : hm m , i remember as a small child i found a dead laocoon in our yard , and i told my mother about it . i thought it was sleeping . but that day , my mother sat me down and explained death to me . ` ` cecil , '' she said , ` ` most of god ' s creatures are born , and then one day they die . just like you and me , one day both of us will die . one of us will do so in a much more eventful way than the other , unlike this laocoon , which died from a rock i dropped on it . joanna : why did your mother drop a rock on a laocoon ? cecil : oh , she was always a jokester , always up to some kind of prank . dropping rocks on people and animals was just her way of bidding around . anyway , these chickens are gorgeous , with their bright orange and yellow wings and dozens of spiny legs . what ' s weird is i always assumed chickens were mythical , because i ' ve never seen one in person . joanna : mm , a lot of people make that mistake in logic . but just because you can not see something , does not mean it does not exist . this is something geologists must always remember , because there are so many creatures not visible to human sight . like amoebas and microbes and ghost horses . when visitors come to the night vale z oo , staff members from our audience education team often hide in the shrubbery and then jump out shouting , ` ` i ' m real ! '' at the blindfolded z oo goes , just to educate people on the existence of things they ca not see . cecil : i ' ve learned a lot of neat things while wearing a blindfold ! we ' ll get back to your wonderful creatures in a moment , joanna , but first today ' s news . cecil : wait , what was that ? joanna : nothing . what ? i did not hear a low growling sound . is it hot in here ? cecil : okay , uh , let ' s have a glance at traffic . the roads are totally clear today , it ' s a real mess out there . no one can see where the streets are , because they are completely transparent . i d like to tell you which avenues and intersections to avoid , but since they ' re virtually invisible , that information is useless . perhaps try walking or just staying at home . joanna : wo w ! glad i flew here today instead of driving , huh ? cecil : good call ! an update on old woman josie . several of you have written in , via email and spray paint on the station walls , that you want to know how she ' s doing . well , she ' s out of the hospital , back home and recovering nicely . apparently josie ' s daughter alondra has come back to night vale to help care for her . i rarely hear josie mention her children , and she did not say much about alondra this time either . apparently alondra decided to return to her home town to take care of her mother , because she did not want an old woman with a broken hip trying to live on her own . josie insisted that she was not living alone , that she had several , what she refers to as angels , named erika , who are taking care of her . as well as her strexcorp foundation , which supports not only the new old opera house , but also several local arts groups , a library destruction fund , and the popular charity cars for kid s , which provides cars to kid s who do not have cars . the angels , according to josie , have lived at her house for several years and have shown nothing but grace , love , and support for her , unlike her family who moved away from the desert . josie definitely sounds upset , and sometimes the forced bond of family relationships can be frustration . but having family to take care of you when you live alone is a true blessing . um , listeners , inter kareem is shaking his head at me and saying josie lives with the angels . now we went over this in the meeting , kareem ! we do not acknowledge the existence of angels , et cet era , et cet era , et cet era , josie lives alone , there ' s no one to take care of her ! oh come on , do not walk out ! ugh . there he goes , a man who does not believe in time-traveling trains or deer-faced destroyed gods , but deny a single angel and he ' s throwing a fit . well , best wishes to old woman josie , and welcome back to night vale , alondra . cecil : so let ' s get back to your fantastic z oo animals , joanna . joanna : sure thing ! let me just get this cage up here on the desk . cecil : listeners , joanna is lifting what looks like a solid steel cub e , onto the desk . she ' s opening it . lots of steam or vapor is coming out , i ' m so excited . what kind of exotic creature has she brought for us in such a dramatic carrying case ? joanna : these , cecil , are brown tarantulas . cecil : oooh . joanna : you do not sound excited . cecil : well , brown tarantulas are fairly common in the desert , i-i was hoping for something exotic like chickens . joanna : of course , but the reason i brought these tarantulas is to talk about our animal development initiative . zoos not only display animals in tiny enclosures for the public to hawk at , but we also train and rehabilitate many of these animals . sometimes animals we bring in have been badly injured , or in the case of these tarantulas , horribly undereducated . you might not notice just by looking at them , but our animal development team has taught these tarantulas to read ! they are fully sentiment . that ' s samantha , that ' s wordy , that ' s n ash , that ' s carmelo . that ' s patrick , that ' s garfield , and somewhere oh , i do not see where she went , is helen . oh , there she is , on the back of your shirt collar ! cecil : aahahaahahahaa-hi , helen ! that ' s amazing ! i know there are several ` ` teach spiders to read '' programs here in night vale . it ' s great to hear some of them are really working . so ugh helen , what book are you reading ? joanna : oh , tarantulas ca not speak . or write . just read . cecil : so they can read , but not express to anyone what it is they have learned ? joanna : y up . cecil : is there any consideration by the z oo about developing sentence in creatures who live in cases ? i mean , do you think that the animals ' self-awareness could bring about stages of depression or resentment , or despair or even rage , if they understood the prison-like conditions in which they lived ? joanna : totally . oh , also i brought in some baby pigs ! cecil : oh pig lets ! oh they ' re so cut e ! um , your name is wobbles , and your name , oh , your name is the professor ! cecil : there ' s that noise again . joanna : i ' m sure it ' s nothing . cecil : did you say ? joanna : cecil , it ' s fine . cecil : oh , ok . let ' s get to our program sponsor now . today ' s show is brought to you by starbucks . start your day off feeling great . maybe grab a latte or a caramel macchiato or even a much frappuccino on your way to work . just make sure you ' re feeling great first . we ' ll know if you ' re not . if you purchase one of our products while not feeling great , you ' re going to make us not feel great , and that kind of nativity is infectious , you know . perhaps you think our coffee-related product line will help you get beyond not feeling great into actually feeling great , but you ca not rely on nutrition stimulants to achieve positively . no , no . caffein and sugar will get your energy up , sure , but that crash is coming , and it wo not be pretty . and we do not want you hanging that on us . get yourself in a good place . really be positive . fake it till you make it , we suppose . but you better be an excellent baker . if we find out you showed up to one of our thousands of starbucks locations worldwide while unhappy , we are going to be livid . just beside ourselves , all of us , every starbucks employee standing in a line , literally beside ourselves , holding hands and saying directly to you : ` ` do not come here with your nasty attitude and expect us to bear the weight . oh no . oh no , you will not . '' starbucks . cool your hot mess before you show your face around here . a few weeks back , we reported several five-headed dragons had arrived in night vale . including hadassah mcdaniels , the sister of current death row inmate , hiram mcdaniels . most of them are between 10 and 25 feet tall , and all have five heads . we ' re getting more and more complaints from local business es and human night vale residents about these dragons . marjory valet , manager of the dollar cinema , says each dragon takes up nearly a dozen seats , not to mention obstructing the view of all the seats behind the dragon ' s mass of long heads . teddy williams , owner of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , had to cancel league nights this week because he ' s having to buff out all of the claw marks in the lanes . it was actually lucky for my team , which is down one member , while old woman josie recovers . bob stern , vice president of finance for the night vale auto insurance company , said his company has seen a significant up tick in dragon-initiated accidents , and that they would no longer cover anyone who owns a car . he then deliberately broke his own arm with a french and guffaw nervously . it ' s been a tough adjustment , night vale , to our five-headed guests from another world , but we are a friendly town . remember to welcome strangers with a friendly point , as you shout ` ` interlopers ! '' at them . also , it ' s considered good neighbor ly behavior to follow strangers home while repeating , ` ` what are you doing ? where you off to ? '' the dragons , i'm.. um , kind of sure mean us no harm . joanna , have you ever seen a dragon up close ? joanna : yes , one . they ' re beautiful things , really intelligent and funny creatures . fiercely loyal . well , to their own kind , anyway . i mean , you ' re testing with a dragon , ` ` what do you do on friday ? '' and she does not text you back , and you ' re like , ` ` donna , i would like to see you , it ' s been weeks , is everything ok ? '' and then one day you get a phonecall and donna ' s gold head is like , ` ` you ' re a great woman , i ' ve had a nice time but '' and her green head is like , ` ` it ' s over , joanna ! '' and then you ' re just crying and crying for what ? i mean , come on donna , really ? cecil : so o what other animals have you brought in ? joanna : well this is a long-horned steer , so majestic and bold . cecil : wo w , look at those horns ! joanna : also those wings . wings are the best part of the steer . cecil : you know , i ' m always in awe of animals who can fly . joanna : ah , it ' s just so delicious ! cecil : joanna ? cecil : joanna , your face it's.. widening . your eyes are turning yellow and and and your paws , i mean , your hands are turning into paws . listeners , joanna is now uh what wh-what are you , ana panther , i think ? oh , she ' s jumping onto the , oh oh my ooh , ooh that is , that is not good . joanna : the wings are the best part in steer , they ' re so.. cecil : listeners , joanna is jumping after the hen s now . we need to oh my god , the pig lets . wobbles ! the professor ! no , i.. ok , well i wish i had not seen that . while we try to restore order , let me take you to the we - microphone are not for eating ! they are smarter than dolphin ! joanna ! cecil : and we are back . our special guest today has been joanna re y , head zookeeper at the night vale z oo . thanks for being on our show , joanna ! joanna : thanks for having me . cecil : you ' ve eaten all of the animals you brought in today . joanna : well , except for the tarantulas . they wandered off . not sure where they went . just like a bunch of spiders to be there one second and gone the next . cecil : oh , my inter kareem tells me they all wandered over to the human resources department here at the station , and applied for sales jobs . apparently they were strong interviews , despite not being able to speak our write . joanna : oh , that ' s a big success for our animal development initiative ! there is so much good a z oo does for animals , besides lock them up and examine them , which is of course just part of maintaining a natural environment for these creatures . without the conservation efforts of the z oo , these animals would just be locked up and examined by predator . cecil : but in the confines of the z oo , they seem to be at risk of being devoured by z oo staff members who turns into predator cats . joanna : cecil , that ' s my lunch we ' re talking about . cecil : so you just got overwhelmed with hunger , and your body turned into a panther and you ate all the animals ? joanna : i ' m a shapeshifter , cecil ! i only take the form of a cat when i eat , because people get all upset when i devour an entire cow looking like a human . i am sorry about the damage to your studio , i really am . i should have eaten before i came . but do not be so quick to judge shapeshifters , cecil ! we do not get ` ` overwhelmed '' . we just choose our appearances based on what we want to express , like clothing . you might wear , say , a shirt around the house doing ch ores or while on vacation , but i imagine you have different outfits to wear to work . cecil : oh yes . although today is plastic porch wednesday so i ' m dressed up a bit more , but yeah , for work i usually wear a cummerbund and carpi parts , because it ' s important to me that people understand i am a journalist . i see what you ' re saying joanna , that ' s fair . i bet being able to take the form of different animals in fact makes your job a lot easier at the z oo . joanna : hm m . i ' ve only ever used this ability to eat lunch , but that ' s a great idea ! i should try it at work sometime . cecil : well thanks for being on our show today , joanna . joanna : sure . you know , there ' s still a lot of chicken blood pooling around your desk . let me get another paper towel . cecil : oh oh no no , it ' s no bother . inter kareem , could you , could you come in here ? stay tuned next , night vale , for the sound of rubbing , followed by the sound of gagging . followed by the sound of liquid dribbling into a metal pan . and as always , good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : want to feel old ? people born in 2014 have already graduated college , do not know what a trombone is , and are all named after gourds .
WTNV|Negotiations|15 October 2016|you are statistical likely . welcome to night vale . today , negotiations began between the representatives of the five-headed dragons , led by hadassah mcdaniels and her team of lawyers , in an attempt to save her brother and fellow five-headed dragon , hiram , from execution . he is charged with the attempted murder of mayor dana cardinal , and the attempted overthrow of city government . we will keep you updated on the negotiations as they happen . but first , the community calendar . on sunday , we will be holding a parade to celebrate the fact that the world probably wo not end in the next few days . monday is cloud amnesty day , the one day a year in which all night vale citizens are allowed to acknowledge and talk about clouds . common topics of discussion include what clouds are made of , what their intentions might be , and why talking about them can result in fines and jail time . the day will end with the usual ceremony , in which the sheriff ' s secret police will do their best to arrest the cloud , marking the restatement of the cloud ban . of course , the only exception to this ban is the glow cloud , who is almighty and gracious in its cruelty . all hail , as everyone in town says every day , at the exact moment of midnight . tuesday , gino ' s italian dining experience and gr ill and bar will be closed for a private event . this private event will be a celebration of bart mentenya ' s 60 th birthday . bart is only two days old , so the private celebration will last just short of 60 years . gino ' s italian dining experience and gr ill and bar will be back to regular business once it ' s over . happy early 60 th , bart ! wednesday is now only available to paid subscribers . please join the days of the week membership program to receive this member-exclusive day . thursday is take work to your daughter day . gather up all your co workers , the furniture and appliances that make up your workplace , all the petty office politics and ballroom bickering , the contents of the supply closet , the structure of the supply closet , the entire building that houses your work , and bring it all piece by piece to your daughter . and then reassembled it for her saying , ` ` see ? see ? '' over and over as she , gape-mouthed , watches your work transplanted monstrous into a place it was never meant to be . be sure to send us cut e pictures of her weeping over what you have done . friday , the museum of forbidden technologies will be opening its newest exhibit : lie detector ! a hands-on , interactive and completely mandatory exhibition organized by a vague , yet menacing government agency . remember : if you have nothing to hide , then you have not confessed yet . we will break you . children and anyone with an implanted government monitoring chip gets half off admission . this has been the community calendar . the first round of negotiations over the fate of hiram mcdaniels continues today at city hall . not much progress has been made . mayor cardinal called a press conference to deliver the following update . dana : people of night vale . i entered these negotiations to represent you . so much of my job now is to bury myself , my own feelings and thoughts and opinions , and instead act as a proxy to all night vale citizens , to do what i think you might want or what is best for you . so here i am , all of night vale in one fragile body , entering into conversation with several towering five-headed dragons . this is just scene-setting , i suppose , this is just me letting you know the situation i ' m in . the argument from hadassah and her lead negotiator , miriam , is that hiram is a suffering citizen of their world , a world ruled by the five-headed dragons . and so , he must be taken back to their world for trial and punishment under their own justice system . it seems odd that they would send hiram ' s own sister as a representative of that justice system , but who am i ? as we discussed before , in many ways , i am no one . i am all of you . i listen politely . i nod . now i will return to this negotiation , the ears of night vale , the mouth of night vale , the collective head of night vale , nodding and listening and talking . more soon from me , from all of us . cecil : there were no follow-up questions , as the reporter began kissing one another . dispassionate at first , but with a growing claustrophobic panic a few moments later , as they were unable to stop . many were heard grunting , their eyes bulging in terror as their arms , against their own desires , began cawing and clutching one another in deep embraces , their lips locked , tongues pressing behind others ' teeth , and noses smashing into cheeks . in other news , here is what we know : the statecraft is 10 miles in diameter , it float 3 miles up . here is what we know : it is translucent blue , lit from within . it radiates heat , but is far enough away that the heat is reduced to warmth . here is what we know : the statecraft is beautiful . beautiful like industrial waste pouring ne on over a barren dead landscape . here is what we know : our landscape is not barren or dead . it is just dry . here is what we know : the landscape around night vale is many landscape , different depending on viewing angle and time of day . now a wall of sea ring sunlight and hot sand , now a carpet rolling away into an inviting distance . this is not any sort of mystical thing , this is just how landscape work . here is what we know : the statecraft has intentions . here is what we do not know : what those intentions are . here is what we do not know : what we will do next , what anyone will do next , what next . here is what we know : the statecraft is 10 miles in diameter , it float 3 miles up . 3 miles below it , there is us , knowing almost nothing at all . this has been the news . in other news , local star reader and commander of an armed militia , tamika lynn , turned 16 years old today . to celebrate , tamika asked to read a statement to our radio audience . and who am i to turn down such a bright young woman with such a powerful and violent army backing her ? ahahah , she truly terrified me . let ' s throw it to tamika . tamika : night vale , today is my birthday . in many ways , this limestone is meaningless . time passes incessantly , not annually . i ' m always older than i was , always more knowledgeable and experienced . every day , i have more memories than i did the day before . but our culture tells me this day means something . so fine , i will make it mean something . i spent my morning in quiet contemplation , reading our culture ' s great religion texts , like the wizard of earth-sea and the collected fictions of borges . i know now the path forward . from this day on , i am no longer the te en leader of an armed te en militia . i am the leader , no adjective , of a militia with only one adjective : armed . i no longer content with being a curiosity , or a good local story , or even just a te en . i want responsibility and respect , and i believe i have earned them . i do not ask for a place in night vale hierarchy , i demand it . or even more , i take it without waiting for permission . and so , it is with great pleasure , and without leaving any room for dissent or protest , that i hereby appoint myself to city council . if the multi-body being or beings that make up the current city council would like to discuss this appointment , i will be waiting for them with the full force of my militia out on the sand wastes . if not , i ' ll see you at the next meeting . leave a chair open for me , or else . you ca not see me , but i ' m pointing at the librarian i ' ve had stuffed and mounted . it was difficult to get the tentacles just right , but my taxidermist retina did an exquisite job . and to night vale , from your newest and youngest city appointed : i will fight for you . after all , what else is an armed militia for ? thanks for all your birthday wishes . happy birthday to you as well . on this day , all of us are older . let us celebrate that with cake ! cecil : wo w ! an unexpected development from tamika lynn ! city council has responded by running up the walls of their chamber and howling like cats , but they seem disinclined to take up her offer of confrontation , so it seems that we have a new member of the city council for the first time well , ever . my best to councilwoman lynn . simone rigadeau , the transient who lives in the earth sciences building of the night vale community college , is reopening classes , which have not been offered in that department since 1983. the curriculum will be modified slightly from the original earth sciences program , removing courses such as elementary oceanography and environmental geology to make room for new course work including ` ` 1983 – the year the world ended ? '' and ` ` clear and distant danger : the terrible mysteries of the distant prince '' . and one course that ' s title is the emboli of a silhouette of a woman , an emboli of the map of italy , and an emboli of an innocent human being living within a perpetual waking nightmare , never able to escape . it ' s good to see education embraced once again in the earth sciences building . you know , it ' s been a fair bit of time since i went to college . maybe i ' ll take a few of those just for my own self-improvement . i mean , education does not stop when you ' re a grown up , you know . and re-education never stops , as long as you do not perfectly echo the city council and world government ' s policies and dictates . update from city hall . it appears that negotiations are breaking down . also possibly , city hall itself , as the building is shaking and smoke is pouring from several of its windows . mayor cardinal is leaning out one of those windows and is giving a statement . we go now to that statement . dana : whoa ! well . it is not going great in here , obviously . they want us to send hiram back to his own world , to be tried and punished under their own laws for attempting to violently overthrow night vale ' s government . so i asked them , well , what ' s the punishment for that over in five-headed dragon world ? and miriam said , ` ` nothing , that ' s just how governments change . you do not punish someone for doing their civic duty by throwing a coup or assassination a head of state . what you do is give them a stick er with a flag on it , and the words ` ` i overthrow '' , so that everyone will know that you are a good citizen who participates in important civic responsibilities . '' i told them i was not about to send hiram back just to get a stick er , and then hadassah jumped in and said that if i did not send hiram back , then she might be earning a stick er of her own . remember , citizens , in that room i am not me . i am you . i am us . and hadassah was threatening us . so i told her , ` ` you are not the first five-headed dragon to threaten me or to threaten my town . it did not go well for the last one , it will go even worse for you . '' which is all to say that the negotiations are going fine . i mean , hadassah threatened to level this city , but i think that ' s just what ' s called a negotiating play . i would not worry about it . overall , i ' m pretty calm about most things . the stress of this job would be unbearable otherwise . hey , knock that off ! ugh , hold on . cecil : listeners , it appears that hadassah is making good on her threat . she is tearing at city hall and oh no ! oh , oh city hall has collapsed ! the enormous dragons are shrugging off the wreck age like so much particles of dust and are now advancing on the rest of night vale . negotiations are going poorly , negotiations are going very poorly . uh , oh the weather is nice though , let ' s hear about that ! dana : thank you for your patience , night vale . i know things were scar y there for a moment , but i hope you held on to your trust in me . hadassah and her dragons have leveled most of this city . entire neighborhoods reduced to a smoulderscape , smoke and rock . schools , hospitals , nothing was safe . everything was destroyed . but as i suspected , the whole thing was just a negotiating play and i held firm . so it ' s all fine , we ' re back at the table and talking again . we are unfortunately no further along than we were at the start , but now they understand that i am a formidable negotiator , and not one they can scare with cheap tactics , like destroying every building in our story . anyway , our busy local contractors will get right to work rebuilding everything . they have a lot of practice since , of course , some threat or the other destroys most of the town once or twice a month . in the meantime , i am you . we are all us . and we are going back to that negotiating table . and hiram mcdaniels is going nowhere at all . cecil : a great statement from our great mayor . hiram , the subject of all this back-and-forth , said only that he ' s not worried at all , that everything is under control , and then four out of five of his heads winked . the rest of us , the rest of town , moved on with our lives . the problem was not solved , but most problems do not get solved . i mean , generally we just do our best to mitigate the problem , and if it ca not be mitigated , then it can be delegated to a background noise by pleasant distractions and a prioritization of interests . we live with hearts that can just stop working at any moment . and yet we still lie in hancocks sometimes , or watch a sit com , or stare at a spot on the wall thinking of many things , none of them having anything to do with the spot on the wall . herds of grazing creatures are routine attacked by predator , but when the attack is over , you know what they do ? they go back to eating grass . let us all , metaphorically , go back to eating grass , or , if you are a member of the rotary club , you can go back to literally eating grass , as usual . best to just ignore danger until it ' s too late . the end will be the same , but the experience along the way will be far more pleasant . stay tuned next for a pilot turning to her co-pilot and saying , ` ` let ' s see what this baby can do . '' good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : the children were right . the floor is lava . but they were wrong about the heat-resistance of sofa cushions .
WTNV|Josefina|1 November 2016|why do birds appear every time you are near ? it ' s likely they planted a track ing device on you . welcome to night vale . listeners , i ' ve been thinking about old woman josie a lot lately . she broke her hip a couple months ago , and has been recovering at home with her daughter alondra , as well as several beings named erika whom josie refers to as angels . now it ' s illegal to acknowledge the existence of angels in night vale , but it ' s certainly not illegal to point out how loving and kind those beings , whatever they may be , have been to josie . i really miss having josie around , especially since bowl ing league started back up last month . apparently , her hip healed but she has had a series of infections that led to her going back to the hospital , where doctors told her there was nothing they could do about the folio virus . alondra said that her mother did not have folio , but the doctors explained it did not matter . the virus existed in the world , and there was nothing they could do about it . alondra pointed out that there was a folio vaccine , had been one for decades . the doctors closed up their books , snorted , and walked briskly from the room saying , ` ` good day ! '' without making eye contact . the angels tried to physically carry the doctors back into the room , but allandra just got an antibiotic prescription and took josie home . in today ' s show , i wanted to share a little bit with you , night vale , about josefina ortiz . her life as a night vale citizen , lover of the arts , and friend of mine . but first , a word from our sponsors . today ' s show is brought to you by palmar . for any product you can think of : home , office , garden , automobile , toys , clothes , groceries ? there ' s your neighborhood palmar , and our always low prices . for every product you can not can not think of : repressed memories , forbidden knowledge , an incorporeal twin sibling dwelling in the back of your brain ? antimatter , cranium ? there ' s also palmar . we will sell you anything , whether you can comprehend it or not . palmar will sell it to you . sentiment map le leaves ? palmar has it . alternate timeline that avoids a climate change apocalypse ? palmar has it . immortality ? palmar has it . and we will beat anyone else ' s price . palmar : save money , live in an alternate timeline . apocalypse avoidance not guaranteed . lack of climate change does not preclude nuclear winter , osteoid impact , or solar flares . please consult the oracle before making any purchases off palmar . low price guarantee not available in michigan . cecil : to tell some of her fantastic stories today , i ' ve asked josie to join me on the show . i have her on the line now . hi , josie ! are you feeling up to league night this week ? josie : hi , cecil ! i ' m always up for league night . i ' ll be ready next week , or the week after that . i ' ve asked my friend sarah to fill in for me while i ' m gone . she ' s never bowled before , but she ' s a quick learner . she is also a fist-sized river rock , so i ' m not sure if she can even pick up a ball and roll it . but like i said , she ' s a quick learner . our team will be just fine . cecil : josie , we are talking today about your history in night vale . i think more than anything , your love of opera has been your greatest gift to our town . josie : my favorite opera growing up was puccini ' s to sca . my mother had a copy we played on our victoria , which we disguised as an ice box , so that the secret police did not know about it . listening to music was illegal then . a minimum of 90 days sentence for anyone caught hearing opera , jazz , or symphonies . even hearing someone walking in rhythm could be construed as a crime . it was not legalized until john cage wrote 4 ' 3 '' . the sheriff had to arrest anyone caught sitting in silence for that length of time , and our prisons became quickly overcrowded , so they decriminalized listening to music . this was great for my father , who had run the old night vale opera house since it was built in 1904. his early productions were rich but colourful , ornate sets and glorious costumes , professionally trained singers who were only allowed to describe what they would sing with their gorgeous booming voices . and orchestra who shouted out , ` ` loud music here ! '' or whispered , ` ` soft music here '' , underneath the text . when listening to music became legal , i begged papa to make to sca the first opera he performed with full singing and orchestration . it ' s about an italian singer whose city is invaded by napoleon . a young man falls in love with her , but she does not notice because she ' s also the general of the italian army , and she crush es napoleon , and brings peace to europe , and frees the enslaved people of svitz . cecil : you played me a version of leonine price singing the famous area from to sca . what was that called ? josie : it was called what up , svitz ? you ' re free now . sadly , the old opera house sat dormant after its last performance in 1983. and ultimately , we had to tear it down in the 1990 ' s because of the puppy infestation . when we began demolition in 1994 , i first met the angels . they would not reveal themselves to me for another 18 years , but they were very tall and they promised to help me . they had no money and no skill and no real knowledge of opera . i gave them a dollar and told them to get lost . cecil : just so the surveillance van across the street can hear , i totally do not believe in angels . thanks , josie . more stories from your time in night vale soon . first , let ' s get to some news . inter kareem reports that hiram is in surprisingly good spirits of a five-headed dragon who is on death row . his execution is slated for later this month . his sister , hadassah , and her five-headed dragon lawyers have been negotiating with mayor dana cardinal for his release . but talks seem to have stalked late last month , when the dragons destroyed most of night vale . hiram spelled out a pretty elaborate escape plan . he told kareem he had been watching the patterns of the guards in the prison , befriend ing a few key members of the security staff , and had gotten a friend of his to slip in some contraband to help with breaking the shackles containing his five necks , wings , tail , and feet . hiram would not identify the exact name of his friend , but he said she was a careless old woman who secretly lived in your home . wo w , kareem , your report is really hard to read ! god , it ' s all crossed out . and then you wrote a bunch of stuff in black marker over it , what does this mess even say ? ` ` off the record , do not read on air '' . oh . ok , umm.. none of what i said just happened , listeners . hiram ' s in prison . that ' s the news . cecil : and now back to old woman josie . tell us more about your life in opera . josie : my mother passed away when i was 28 , and papa did not last long after that . they were in love since they were 15 and did not want to be apart for longer than they had to be . so i joined the night vale board of culture in order to stay active with the opera house and to support other artistic endeavors in town . in my 50 years on the board of culture , we started a youth orchestra society , founded the night vale community theater , ordered the removal of all french horns from the high school marching band , and supported a performance art initiative to put tarantulas in bags and leave them in the back seats of unlocked cars . the arts have always thrive here in night vale , and many people have applied to serve on the board of culture . during my last few years of service , several of the beings who call themselves erika began applying to be on the board . they still had no money or skill , but they seemed to know a lot more about opera and music and theater . but the city would not allow them on the board , because they said the beings named erika did not exist . i did not understand it at the time , so i asked them all to serve on an unofficial advisory committee i made up to get more arts lovers involved . i did not believe in angels , certainly , but i did believe whatever they were , they cared about art . cecil : let ' s take a news break here , and then we ' ll return to old woman josie . the night vale transit authority today announced that they would be reopening the subways , which was closed three years ago , less than half a day after it opened . spokespersons from the transit authority wearing deer masks and performing a ritual dance involving waving hands above their heads whilst squatting with their legs spread outward , distributed reaches to citizens . upon each reach was a single word . sometimes the word was something obvious like ` ` train '' or ` ` service '' or ` ` schedule '' . but others had less mass-transit related words like ` ` crates '' and ` ` desert '' and ` ` destroyed '' , and on one particular reach , just the word ` ` huntokar '' . after several hours of people screaming and swatting at their hair and parts , reporter determined that all the word-marked reaches comprise a press release detailing all of the permanent information about the subways reopening . so as soon as we find all the reaches and place them in the correct order , we ' ll bring you more information on the subways . cecil : speaking of reopening , josie , you managed to construct the new old night vale opera house last year . josie : it was three years before that , when i realized it was possible . the angels , who had served for ten years in a secret advisory capacity for the board of culture , finally revealed themselves to me . i was changing light bulb on my porch , and my back and balance were not what they once were , and i fell off my stepladder . these tall winged friends , all named erika , lifted me before i hit the ground . a bright black glow illuminated the air around them and me . one of the angels gently twisted out the old bulb and replaced it . they handed the burned bulb to me and said , ` ` we can change things . '' i told them , ` ` yes , you are angels , i believe in you . you are angels and you can change things . we , we can change things . '' and then the same angel said , ` ` i just meant the light bulb . we can change light bulb . '' but i wanted to change the burned-out opera house . i wanted to build a new one . and the angels called upon night vale ' s richest citizens , millionaire marcus vanston , to join their ranks . and they bought the strexcorp corporation , liquidated its as sets , things like office computers , military grade helicopter and mind control collars . the angel who used to be marcus managed the strexcorp foundation and used those funds to build the new opera house . cecil : i always wondered what happened to marcus . josie : opera is vital to this city , more than you know . alondra is a good daughter , moving back to her home town , a town she never liked much , to take care of her ailing mother . i ' m getting around , i really am better , cecil . but alondra , she ' s treating this hip thing like ho spice or something , she ' s asking me about my will , about where i keep my records . she ' s going through my stuff asking what things i wan na keep and what we can get rid of . she ' s always been a high st rung and organized child . cecil : i d like your bowl ing ball , if you ' re getting rid of things . josie : it ' s yours , cecil ! cecil : thanks , josie . i wo not need it for aq long time , i ' m sure of that . let ' s finish up our introspective of old woman josie in just a moment , listeners . but first , let me get to the weather . cecil : we are back in the studio with old woman josie . are you and allandra getting along ok ? josie : alondra is a good girl , but she never wanted to live in night vale . i have not seen her for almost 20 years and she ' s doing fine wherever she ' s living . ak-lahama i think she called it . apparently it ' s an actual state , but i could not find anything about it when i looked it up . i think it ' s in texas somewhere . either way , i left alondra mostly out of my will . i mean , family things like photo albums , ancestry records , and any of the hot milk i keep in my hot milk drawer , i left to her . i do not want her to not have anything , i love her . but i left strexcorp to the angels , to the elias , who helped establish the foundation , who managed the foundation , who have done nothing but support opera and all the arts here in night vale for decades . cecil : well that makes perfect sense . is she mad though , i mean that none of the money you have is going to her ? josie : not at all , she understands . plus she ' s built a comfortable life for herself . she does not want or need money , but the city does not recognize the existence of angels , cecil . without me , they can not legally run strexcorp . so it will be left to my next of kin , which is alondra . alondra does not want to manage an arts foundation . she does not want to stay in night vale to underwrite new play openings or poetry sham ing festival or sculpture punch ing gardens . she plans to close down the foundation and donate the money back to the city . cecil : that sounds great ? josie : cecil . the elias built that foundation . they built that opera house . everything they have worked for will be liquidated and given to the very city which denied their existence . cecil , i need your help . the angels need your help . the opera needs your help . cecil : josie , i.. josie : angels are real , cecil . say it . cecil : josie , you said it yourself . you ' re feeling better , you ' re up and about , alondra ' s just reacting to stress but she ' ll get to go home soon , now that you ' re healed . josie : you ' re right , cecil . we ' ll talk about this more next week at league night . we ' re not done here . cecil : ok , josie . josie : oh and before we go , thanks everyone who ' s been bringing food by the house while i ' ve been under the weather . your old friend earl came over . i remember you two used to be joined at the hip wearing your boy scout uniforms and neck kerchiefs and baseball clubs . cecil : huh . i do not remember any of that . josie : earl brought me a delicious apple pie he baked himself . he used a butter crust and fresh-picked macoun apples . he even added some cranberries , capers and metal shavings . what a clever chef ! so thanks to earl , and you cecil , for looking out for me . cecil : thanks for sharing your life with night vale , josie . stay tuned next for the sound of a balloon popping . stay tuned . it will happen . eventually . aaany minute now . stay tuned ! and as always , good night , night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : if there ' s not a race to get to the dance competition on time , then your screenplay is not finished .
WTNV|Flight|15 November 2016|those who remember history are also doomed to repeat it . welcome to night vale . despite the best efforts of hadassah mcdaniels and her team of five-headed dragon lawyers , her brother , hiram mcdaniels , is schedule to be executed today for his crimes against state and city . city government promises that by the end of this broadcast , hiram mcdaniels will be dead . well . night vale ' s executioner , dale salazar , has once again been raised from the graveyard . when asked for a comment , dale coughed through disuse vocal cords for a while before finding his soft voice , not used since the last public execution more than three decades ago . secret executions are much more common . ` ` i hope to provide a quick and humane death , '' he said . ` ` if it has to happen , and i ' m told it does , then i will have it happen with as much mercy as possible . '' he then lowered his canvas executioner ' s hood , painted with a screaming monster face , and began marking his chest with the ritual signs of the blood stone circle . hadassah and her lawyer , miriam , were fuming - literally breathing fumes of fire , in their anger about mayor cardinal ' s complete refusal to budge on the issue of the execution of hadassah ' s brother . ` ` hiram is a citizen of our world , not yours , '' miriam said . ` ` to inflict on him the justice of mere humanity is a crime against not just one dragon , but all dragons everywhere . '' hadassah added , ` ` if you touch one head on my brother ' s five necks , i will end you and your puny world . '' hiram himself has showed no worry about his forthcoming departure from our plane of existence . ` ` let ' s just say i do not plan to be around when they want to make it so i ' m not around , '' his gold head said , and then his gold head winked , and his violet head rolled his eyes about the wink . ` ` walls can not hold us ! '' roared his green head . ` ` or they can , up to now , but they will not for much longer ! '' it seems despite the news of his escape plans being , um , accidentally broadcast on the radio recently , hiram is confident they will continue without a hit ch , due to his careful planning and the help of an unnamed accomplice . who he would only say was ` ` quite old '' and ` ` completely careless '' . hiram has worked his way out of more difficult situations , and so my worry is not with him , but with old woman josie . her broken hip has led to an infection , and she has been mostly confined to her bed for the past couple weeks . she was not able to come to league night at all , and i ' m worried about her ability to bowl ever again . her friend sarah sultan took her place on our bowl ing team last week and was a surprisingly good bowler ... but it ' s not the same without josie . she continues to be positive about it and says that it ' s just one of those things , and she ' ll be out and about in no time , but i do not know . i just do not know . well . we ' ll keep you updated about hiram as the day moves on , but in the meantime , i will move on to the news . ` ` everything ' s fine with the water , '' came an prompted announcement from officials . the officials emphasized that despite what you may have heard , the water is safe to drink and even to let touch your skin in moderate quantities and for a limited period of time . the officials dipped their gloved hands into the water and brought the water up to their mouths . ` ` mm mmm ! ! '' the officials said , clearly letting the water splash out of their hands without ever getting near their clamped shut mouths . ` ` look at us , drinking this delicious , clean water ! definitely it is safe and normal water and there is no need for testing , or even look at it too closely . '' the officials then disposed of the gloves and retired from the press conference without asking questions , biting their need for an immediate chemical shower . lieutenant regis of unit 7 of the local national guard station and of combo store said he was not surprised at all . something like this had been due to happen , and it was only a matter of time . ` ` most everything ' s a matter of time , '' he said . ` ` we exist in it , time . and space , '' he added thoughtfully , then snorted and said , ` ` but of course space is just the physical aspect of time , in the same way that meat is the physical aspect of sentence . '' he laughed at his joke , although it was not clear to anyone else what the joke was , or even which part of what he had said had been the joke . the lieutenant was burying himself in the sand wastes , until he was covered to the hips , just a tarso sticking out of the sand . ` ` thanks for reaching out again , '' he said , ` ` always nice to talk to old friends ! '' he smiled , made finger guns at a passing cloud , and began beautifully to sing . this has been the news . the countdown continues to the planned time of hiram ' s death . dale salazar has completed his blood stone rituals and is now doing some preparatory stretching and light aerobic . he explained , ` ` it ' s important that your body be literally warmed up in order to prevent injury . we do not want any injuries , except obviously the fatal ones i will be inflict ing , but no cramps or torn muscles , you know . '' mayor cardinal watched in solemn silence as everything was made ready for the death of her attempted murderers , four out of five of the heads of hiram mcdaniels . the only one not sentenced is the violet head . but in a statement , violet shouted repeatedly from hiram ' s prison cell : ` ` we are different heads , but a single being ! we do not know what will happen to me if the other heads die , this is murder ! murder ! ! '' there was a follow-up statement from hiram ' s green head saying : ` ` stop pulling and help us with the wall ! ! '' then gray issued a statement saying : ` ` well now you ' ve told them about the wall , it ' s all ruined . '' and gold issued a final statement saying : ` ` he just meant folks , help us examine how impenetrable and secure this wall is . no one could ever escape from here , no matter how many extremely clever heads he has . '' later , hiram was seen wandering the exercise yard , casually leaving a trail of dirt and pebbles behind him as he walked . meanwhile , hadassah and her fellow dragons have been moved to a designed free speech cage , which is heavily reinforced and electrified for the protesters ' protection . they will remain in the free speech cage until they stop breathing so much fire at people . and in news i can not help but focus on.. josie has been feeling , uh , lethargy all day . the elias , whom she insists i call angels despite how deeply illegal it is and how that could get me in a good deal of trouble , are all standing out in her yard , their heads bowed , moaning low and crying . which is not a good sign , obviously . i-i-i-i ' m worried about hiram of course , and i ' m also worried about josie . i am worried about my friend . and now a station editorial . there has been much talk lately about the dangers of dreams . and yes , we concede , it seems like madness that our brains force us to experience apparent realities we have no control over , and that are often confusing and frightening . we could be spending that time in our own reality that we have no control over , and that is often confusing and frightening . while the recreational use of dreams is understandable in moderation , dream advocates do not want to stop there . there are reports of dreams being given to young children or even babies . that said , we also can not get behind the current push to band dreams altogether . you ' ll have , of course , seen the flyers and posters pointing out alarming statistics , such as that three in five dreamers do not even own a properly registered dream journal , and that there is currently a loophole where anyone who sleeps can just have a dream , without going through any kind of background check . but dreaming is our right . it is a foolish right , one that was instituted by people living in a different time , and with little thought as to the ratification through history of their incomplete grasp of the world , but a right nonetheless . if dreams are criminalized , then only criminals will have dreams . for this reason , dreams should not be ban ned . but we do believe there needs to be common sense restrictions on dreaming , such as banking the more powerful and dangerous forms of dreams , like night terrors and day dreaming . and requiring all citizens to report their dreams to specifically programme satellites that will take those dreams and carry them whizzing around the earth . some day when all of us humans are gone , the satellites will continue to whirr in the cold vacuum above , carrying the dreams of the long dead . and in that way , with their tiny mechanical bodies , we will live on . this has been a station editorial . and now it ' s time for the children ' s fun fact science corner . please use the materials we sent you to follow along at home . the first thing you ' re going to want to do is make an incision just above the main artery . you see the pulling thing ? right , so put a finger on that , and then cut just above your finger . great ! now there ' s going to be some oozing , but is not there always some oozing , kid s ? oozing is natural , it ' s what separates us from the machines . oh , speaking of machines , now is when you ' re going to use those wires we sent . insert them in the incision . mm hm m . oh , very good . if you ' re having trouble getting them in there , just push really hard . ok , now ask your parents to help you with this next bit , as it could be a little dangerous . once you have pushed the wires all ll the way into your heart cavity , you ' re just going to need to get any normal household car battery and attach the wires to that . following the experiment , you might have some side effects like a general movement outwards , a sagging of the in sides , or just jaw . if you experience any of these , please do let us know , as that data is helpful to us . this has been your children ' s fun fact science corner . we have reached it , listeners , the time schedule for hiram ' s execution . the guards walk down the corridor to retrieve him . dale salazar hop s up and down and makes a series of soft grunts . his municipal executioner ' s rifle held high above his head . the mayor still stands in determined silence . hadassah hiss es at the electrified bars of her cage . the door is opened and hiram is not there . instead , there is only a hole in the wall . yes , listeners , it appears that hiram has been digging a hole in his wall , hiding it behind the poster of a hole in the wall that has been hanging in his cell this entire time . the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home was clearly able to smuggled him some simple tools , since the prison cell was technically his home and so , according to to the rules of her existence , she was already inside of it , secretly living there . he used these tools , like a jackhammer and scaffolding and several meters of tunnel lighting and a generation , to slip out of night vale ' s grasp , just as his time had come . what a clever dragon ! the guards rushed to the window to see him winging his way up into the sea ring blue sky , truly free for the first time in over a year , flexing muscles that have not seen use during his captivity . green howls with joy . blue and gold , caught up in the moment , join him . all of us in night vale follow this escape with rapt attention . iii think i can see him from my studio right now . even josie at home in her bed , weak but still awake , listens to hiram ' s escape and feels in his flight some sense of rising , some sense of the possibility of escape for us all . hiram is a criminal , but in this moment , he is also a kinetic monument to joyous animal freedom and oh oh , i.. um.. we take you now to the weather . we all know what happened . we all ... night vale , there has been a death . let ' s start there . just start with the fact of it and ... i ' m still in shock , so ... i ' m sorry , uh , this wo not be up to the strict , neutral journalistic quality you ' ve come to expect from me i ' m just ... i ' m i-i ' m just so shocked , i ' m just ... so ... there has been a death . one who was once living is not . it happened during hiram ' s escape , he rouse into the air and our hearts rouse with him , and i listened from my booth . in her bed , josie listened too . ` ` we are free ! ! '' green roared . ` ` no cell can contain me ! '' ` ` this is the least sad i ' ve ever felt , '' gray said . ` ` physics is merely a mathematical expression of the joy of movement , '' said blue . ` ` i was against this from the start ! '' said violet . then he conceded , ` ` but i was wrong ! higher ! let ' s fly higher ! '' and violet laughed . hadassah and miriam roared in joy . mayor cardinal tightened her lips . ` ` let him run , '' the mayor said . ` ` we will find him again . '' but dale salazar was not interested in that . he had been raised from the grave to do a job , and he did not let simple things like escape get in the way of that job . he began logging underneath the flying dragon , saying ` ` hop , hop , '' as he ran . he could not keep up with the power of the dragon ' s wings . ` ` it ' s ok , '' shouted the mayor . ` ` he ' s gone , dale , it ' s ok . '' but dale did not hear . dale salazar began to fire at the escaping dragon . ` ` no you do not ! '' he screamed . his mask had fallen off during his running , and his face was red , his eyes were wide , he fired at hiram . ` ` no you do not ! '' he screamed again . ` ` your bullets are useless against me ! '' green said , and they were useless against him . they missed green completely . it was violet who was hit , the bullet entering just beneath his jaw line . it only took one shot . i do not think violet suffered at all . on the downstroke of a wing , violet was alived and united with the four other heads that made up the whole of hiram , and on the upstroke.. violet was dead . and the other heads reeled at the loss of a part of themselves . there was a gap in their being that they had never experienced , should never have experienced . hiram ' s body faltered , suddenly clumsy , re gaining only some semblance of flight . the rest of him continued on , the dead violet swinging below . mayor cardinal shouted , ` ` no ! '' but only after what was done , was done . the ` ` no '' was not a command but a regret . she opened her mouth . she closed her mouth . she did not know what to say . she said nothing about situation al irony . she said nothing about unnecessary tragedy . she said nothing more about anything . hadassah screamed in impotent rage and despair . she claw ed over and over at the bars of the cage , powerful electric shocks ran through her , but she felt none of them . she claw ed and claw ed , howling with a voice even she did not recognize . at home , old woman josie put her hands over her face . she felt a plunging inside . and it was this sorrow that gave her the energy to slowly get out of bed , to gobble out into the front yard and join the elias . she put her arms around them . they surrounded her in a deep , glowing slackness , and together they shared their surprise and their grief . dale salazar , job more or less done or at least someone killed , returned satisfied to his grave , buried again until the next public execution is needed . and i ... sit here , in front of my microphone making useless sounds with my useless mouth . discovering the weightlessness of stories before the heavy weight of the world . stay tuned next for ... i do not know . i do not care . good night . today ' s proverb : so there ' s this commercial and it ' s like there ' s this baby and she ' s not getting along with the dog , she ' s like a little afraid of the dog and the dog is like a big a beautiful golden retriever and um , so like the golden retriever like feels sad co z he ca not be with his family because the baby does not like him , but so the dad sees that um , the baby likes the the um , stuffed animal that she has which is a lion , so the dad goes and orders a lion mane for the dog and then he puts it , he puts it on the dog and the dog , um the dog walks in as the lion and the baby loves it and the dog is happy co z it can be a part of the family again , as a as a lion . thank you .
WTNV|Michigan|30 November 2016|here comes the sun . here comes the sun . here comes the sun . it does not stop . welcome to night vale . to start today ' s show , i wanted to talk a bit about our indomitable radio inter , kareem . he ' s become such a talented reporter here at the station . kareem told me this morning that he had written to his family back in his home state in mitchigan.. mi.. michigan , to tell them about all the recent events he ' s reported on . like the five-headed dragons and the strangers led by that horrible eagle , and the reopening of the laser tag center at the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex . they must be really proud of you , kareem , and all the great work you do . the fantastic stories you ' ve gotten to cover here at your internship . thank you for your good work . and now , an update . many of you have written in with your concerns over old woman josie . well , good news , listeners . after suffering a broken hip and a series of infections that kept her bedridden most of that time , she is feeling much better . she still needs a cane and occasionally a wheelchair to relieve bodily exhaustion , but she is out and about . i got to see her last tuesday at the desert flower for bowl ing league night . she has not been able to bowl in nearly a year , but she has not lost any of her skill . she came with her many friends named erika who claim to be.. angels ! she bowled a perfect store , cane and all . her delivery did seem a bit weaker than usual , and her friends often stood right behind her as she rolled the ball . the elias would hum , and close their many eyes , and lift their many arms slowly into the air , and josie ' s ball would straighten out , pick up speed , and demolish all ten pins . the opposing team complained she was cheating , receiving help from angels , but that team was promptly arrested for acknowledging the angels ' existence and had to forfeit . josie , being a good sport , protested their arrest and said the elias were indeed angels , and that we should all be free to acknowledge them . no one wanted to arrest a debilitated old woman , so they left it alone . i ' m so glad my friend is feeling better . she looks quite a bit older than i remember , but i ' m just glad she ' s back at the bowl ing alley . oh ? ok . kareem is telling me i apparently did not tell his whole story earlier . i thought we were just talking about what a good job he did , but i guess there ' s more . ok then . kareem says after he wrote his family , he did not receive back a letter of pride and congratulations . he got a letter that said , ` ` lies ! ! ! ! '' in all capital letters and several exclamation marks . it continued : ` ` you are a liar . you are a liar and we do not understand why you are doing this to us . please do not write us again . you are an impostor . '' it is then signed , ` ` misha '' . kareem tells me that this is indeed his mother ' s handwriting and that is her name . i told him that parents do not always communicate their love exactly how we would like . radio is not a lucrative business . maybe she is just expressing motherly concerns about his career choice and well-being . he says she ' s always been so loving and supportive , so my explanation makes no sense . part of an internship is learning to receive feedback , kareem . well , thanks for the whole story . and now an update on the dragons . after last month ' s accidental murder of one of hiram mcdaniels ' five heads , hadassah mcdaniels , hiram ' s sister , her lawyer miriam and several other dragons from whatever world they came from , have taken up hopefully temporary residence in night vale , claiming they will not leave until they get retribution , by which i ' m hoping they just meant a heartfelt apology . no one has seen or heard from hiram since the tragedy . hadassah dug a cave beneath the ralph ' s , where all dragons are now living . week day shift manager charlie bear said the heat of the dragons ' cumulative breath , even underground , has ruined their produce section . most of the green have wilt ed . the whole store smells like onions now , he said . bear added , ` ` to be fair , the dragons have been coming up to shop for groceries , so i do not want to complain about new business , but they do not like our selection of meats and have been eating a few of our regular customers . and we ca not have that . or i guess we can , '' he said , ` ` as long as they pay for whatever food they take , which they ' ve been good about , so.. '' and then he rattled the loose change in both pockets and lit a cigarette with just his mind . and now ugh , oh god . ok , i thought i was just going to do a quick spotlight on a good inter to start the show , but kareem is nudging me again , listeners . apparently , i left some details out of his story . not everything needs to be a 100 percent accurate account of your personal history , kareem ! this is a radio show , not patrick rothfus ' s best-selling memoir , ` ` the name of the wind '' . your demand for details makes me look bad ! listeners , kareem ' s really focused on correcting every little fact , which makes him a good reporter but also kind of a snitch . so , to start . it seems i ' ve been mispronouncing kareem ' s home state of michigan . how do you say it , kareem ? michigan ? right , that ' s what i ' m saying . michigan . mmmitcchigan . mmisshtigan . michigan . mishhtigan . ok , i ' m sorry kareem , i just ca not hear the nuances of your regional accent . the point is , listeners , kareem said that he had sent a second letter home to his family , asking if everything was ok , and if they were happy with his career and how he is living his life . he just wanted to make them proud . he received another letter back in his mother ' s handwriting . the letter read : ` ` my son kareem is in my home . i am looking at him right now . he is tall . he has long black hair and green eyes . he is a beautiful and honest and hardworking boy . he has a birth mark on his right hand , shaped like a salamander . this is not you . you are not this person . '' the letter continued : ` ` kareem is in college studying broadcast journalism . he is not you . i do not know you . who are you ? why are you pretending to be my son ? we can not find any record of a town called night vale anywhere . please stop writing me , whoever you are . '' and then it is signed ` ` misha '' . kareem , you are tall , with long black hair and green eyes . you have a birchbark on your right hand . it ' s shaped more like a liza rd though , so maybe you have the wrong house ? who knows . just one of those things , i guess . anyway , thanks for the story , kareem ! and now an update on our schools . the enormous glow cloud – all hail – which serves as president of the night vale school board , called for an increase in education funding to support the influx of new students . after the annexation of neighboring town desert bluff , as well as the new five-headed dragon kid s that arrived with the five-headed dragon delegation , night vale schools desperately need more teachers and classroom . not to mention additional fireproofing . the glow cloud – all praise the mighty cloud – delivered this message via press release scrawled in thick paint across several dead animals , which had dropped from its great translucent body above town . it took reporter several hours to place each of the animals in the correct order to make sense of the press release , but they think they got it . mayor dana cardinal and sheriff sam sent out their own press re leases , claiming a lack of available funding for the schools . the mayor said she will look into it , but does not want to raise taxes . the sheriff simply growled and fired a pistol into a target dummy shaped like a dragon . the city council , minus newest member tamika lynn , shrieked and then left on a beach vacation , saying they needed an increase in sunlight and tropical drinks and that , so what if sometimes they do not call ? it does not mean that they are not into a relationship , just that sometimes they ' re busy . here at the radio studio , our brokenhearted station management cried quietly in their office , which was a truly off-putting and strange sound . the glow cloud – we are not worthy to rub our faces in the mud before its beneficent presence , oh maker and un maker of all things – indicated that it would continue to bring up this issue at school board meetings . more on this story as it develops . oh god , kareem , really ? rrrr . ok , kareem is now telling me that he called his parents to talk to them about the letters they sent to him , but a familiar voice answered the phone . it was not his father redeem , nor his brother amir.. it was him . kareem answered his own phone call . kareem tried to explain who he was to himself , but the other kareem said that it could not be true , that there was only one him , and he was it . kareem asked to speak with his mother , but kareem said , ` ` i do not know your mother , i only know my mother '' and hung up . kareem said he wanted to go home to see his family . i told him he might be confused by it , but to take a close look at a map of the united states . he did , and was dismayed to find there was no michigan . michigan ? michigan , i think that ' s it , right ? he said his home state should be right between oheeo and canada , and that it ' s shaped like a mitten . i said he ' s thinking of maine which looks like a mitten that ' s been added up , and you ' re looking at it from like a side angle . he said the us map looks correct when he stares at the whole thing , but when he looks closely at where michigan should be , it ' s not there . he ' s now pacing in the cubic le area , pulling at his hair , sweating . i ' m worried about him . he ' s never quite behaved like this before . um , i ' m go n na tell him to go home , visit his family , take some time off work . while i do that , here is today ' s weather . kareem is back already . said he spent the last two weeks at home . i told him he d been gone about five minutes , you know , long enough to report the weather . but he pointed to the calendar and , i ' ll be darned , he ' s right ! it ' s been two weeks ! huh . that weather report took way y longer than i thought . kareem said he took a flight to grand rapid , but when he landed , he was back in night vale . he tried several flights , even to some of the cities of detroit and chicago , neither of which i ' ve ever heard of , hoping to just catch a bus or something from there , but all flights landed back at the night vale airport . now kareem ' s a good inter , but not very knowledgeable of how air travel works . the whole point is the joy of flying , not the destination . no one likes going places . they just like the comfort of flying . airline send you in the air for a few hours and serve you good food while you relax . then , they take you home . the airport having failed him , kareem got in his car and drove to michigan . he kept getting lost and ending back up where he started , but after days of trying , he finally arrived . he found his family was there , joyfully surprised to see him . he told them about the letters he sent and the ones he received . he was crying . they said they had not heard from him in ages and were starting to get worried . they did not receive or write any letters . he asked if he was already there . ` ` was i home this whole time ? '' he asked his mother . she just hugged him and said , ` ` you ' re here now . '' he asked ami r : ` ` was i here ? did you see me here while i was gone ? '' ami r said : ` ` you ' ll always be here , kareem . '' he asked his father : ` ` are dragons real ? are there other worlds ? is satan a eagle puppy ? '' his father laughed and said : ` ` you were always the funny one ! '' they embraced . kareem stayed for a few days . they had dinners together and watched moves . kareem tried to talk about his time in night vale , but found he was not able to remember any of it . he eventually could not even remember the name of this town he d been living in for two years , and after a while , he forgot that he had ever been anywhere else at all . he had forgotten night vale and his people in his mind , but not in his body . he could feel he was supposed to be somewhere else . he did not want to be anywhere else , but he did not feel like it was his decision . he fought this feeling for days . finally , one day , his father asked if he wanted to go see a university of michigan football game . redeem said : ` ` they ' re a talented team this year . it ' s been nearly 20 years since they won a title . '' kareem said he thought they won a championship two years ago with someone named sandero at quarter back . his father said that was not possible , the team was terrible two years ago . kareem had some errands to run , so he told his family he would meet them at the game . he got in his car , fully intending to see them in less than an hour , but instead he drove and drove , not knowing to where . and after several days with no map or destination , he arrived back in night vale . and he remembered his life here again . he called his mother when he got home to tell her he was safe , but she only screamed into the phone saying : ` ` no ! no ! you ' re here ! i ' m looking right at you ! kareem , you ' re here in my home you ' re right here in my home . how are you calling me ? '' i love our internship program . kareem has become an excellent reporter and editor . maybe one day he will replace me here at the station , who knows . but beyond professional development , i want our interns to learn the bigger lessons of life , and love , and family , and death . kareem has not thought much about aging , i ' m sure , but as we get older , as we leave home , we form for ourselves an independent identity , no longer impressed upon by families . we take the last shape they craft ed , a partially chiselled stone sculpture , and we are left to try to finish the work ourselves . hopefully , they have provided good tools . hopefully , the world te aches us how to better use them . and for the rest of our lives , we are gently hammering away at the curves and crevices of the great masterpiece that are our lives . sometimes , as we work , we become less recognizable to the families who first shaped us . they critique the craftsmanship , the artistic direction , they worry too much has been cut away or that , quote , ` ` those arms just do not look proportional '' . in some cases , they no longer recognize us for the adults we are . family expectations are high . but underneath it all , there ' s love , and worry , and a knowledge that you will do right for yourself . your family may not trust that knowledge , but they know they have to try . kareem is back at his desk , staring at a map of the us , but he does not look fearful or worried anymore . he looks like a young man – a grown man , but still a young man with a purpose . he is a journalist , doing a journalist ' s job : to seek truths , to understand the world . i ' m proud of him . proud of you , kareem ! he ' s giving a thumbs up . ok , let ' s talk about your editing though , that weather report was like way too long , like five minutes max , ok ? stay tuned next for the slow , low sounds of enormous plates shifting deep below us . listeners , i ' ll be taking off work in a couple weeks to well , just to take some time off . but we ' ll be in touch again in the new year . as always , good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : a star hotel will put a mint on your pillow , while a star hotel will put candy bars in your butt .

violet head : i do not trust recorded communication . you never know what the government will do with it ! i ' ll just say congratulations the next time i see everyone ! gold : ok then . cheers , y'all . michelle nguyen : happiness is pretty popular , i guess . everyone ' s always trying to be happy , so i do not really want to be happy . but i am and it ' s fine , i guess . once i ironically went to a kate perry concert , but ended up having a great time . especially the final , where she peeled off all her skin and proclaimed that beauty is right here . and then she pulled out her own heart and swatted it like a beach ball toward her back up dancers . but then i found out that james blake used to do the same thing at his shows , so anyway , what i ' m trying to say is this is ... nice . or whatever . you ' re nice . good job attempting to be happy . inter maureen : yeah , i agree with michelle . i tried to be happy once when i was 13 just to prove a point . i only made it a couple of weeks , and i gave up when i found out that other people were copying me . i ' m happy now , happy i ' m here . also , i ' m not mad anymore . no one asked , maureen , gee ! that ' s not true though . i asked . i asked myself , ` ` maureen , are you still angry ?

let me count the ways . i love thee when thou br ingest coffee in bed , or suggest that we go to branch instead . i eat french toast but take bites of thine eggs like , oh du de , i love thee with so much grace , and praise , and poise and style and pizazz . each day ' s most quiet need and all that jazz . love thee just as much as i love the cave . that cave in our yard from which voices sound , demanding all our smiles , tears , and breath . when the voices speak , time goes all unwound . merciful cave , we grovel , offer flesh . we will enter the cave , crawl underground . i shall but love thee better after death . a famous love poem , but for a good reason . may you never forget that at the heart of any strong relationship , there is a cave . a cave you will both someday crawl into and never be heard from again . cheers ! basimah : cheers ! dana cardinal : it is such a big day . as mayor , i declare that today is a big day . i always knew today would come . just look at any calendar and you can see every single day that will come . they ' re all laid out , right there . for a long time , i thought i would not get to see today in person , but here i am . our time and our place match ing there within the simple geometry of a monthly planner . the city council sends their regards as well . before they left , they lowered and glowed , and i could hear a soft growl . not the growl of madness or of being mad ; it was the kind of growl you hear from rainwater drains along the curbs late at night . a sweet , ca ring growl . also , our director of emergency press conferences , pamela , came too . she wanted to wish you the best . pamela mitchell : yes . thank you , mayor cardinal . people of night vale . people below night vale . and all of the people prepositionally existing somewhere . i ' m here to tell you that the planets are all wrong ! i have spent weeks staring into the sky , and i can tell you the planets are all wrong . misaligned , sure , but more than that they are so small ! planets should not be that small ! thank you for listening . be safe , night vale . dana : what pamela means is , congratulations . pamela : i refuse to congratulate anything that is not the right size ! cecil : oh sorry everyone , i ' m being told we need to move this inside because of , well you know.. the weather . marcus vanston/ erika : yeah , sure , whatever . i have nearly infinite powers , so it ' s pretty basic helping you to a mike . old woman josie ( retta ) : no need to brag . ok , well . cecil , i remember when you finally grew old enough to join the bowl ing team . who ' s this kid think he is ? we all thought . and you have to be honest with yourself , you were not that good at the time . but you were friendly , and entertaining to talk to . sometimes it ' s more important to have delightful people around you , than it is to succeed at some arbitrary goal you ' ve given yourself . that ' s one of the many things i ' ve learned on my way from little josie ortiz to old woman josie . and speaking of delightful people , carlos . you might not have noticed but we ' re suspicious of newcomers around here . we tend to point and shout , ` ` interlopers ! '' but you understood that people are just silly about change , and the older we get , the villier about change we get . carlos , you are a delightful person . i do not know how much longer i have , i guess none of us do . except those of us who peeked at our death day in the hall of public records . but i lived long enough to see you two on this day . i surrounded myself with delightful people , you ca not hope for a better life than that . erika ! help me down from here . they ' re tired of listening to an old woman talk . they all wan na eat cake . erika ! marcus/erika : yeah ok , i ' m coming . whatever ! steve carlsberg : i ' m go n na get emotional , but i ' ll try to hold it together . you know , cecil and i first met at one of these things . seems like we should have met earlier than that . i had dated his sister for a while . but cecil ' s busy , he - he serves his community . he really gives himself to his community . who do you live for , you know ? who do you give yourself to ? those are questions we should all be asking ourselves . there are many questions we should all be asking ourselves . question everything , i guess , would be my main advice . now the sheriff is making throat-cutting gestures to me , indicating that i should stop talking about that . and also to threaten that they ' ll cut my throat if i keep going . sorry , sam ! and carlos . unlike most of us , you do not tell yourself a story of what you want the world to be . you wait for the world to tell you what it is . and then you take it as it reveals itself to you . what a rare and precious gift ! when i met you i could tell you saw me for me , not for any stories you d been told about me . i love you , carlos . and i love you , cecil . we do not always see eye to eye , but more and more , we ' ve stood shoulder to shoulder , members of the same family . i ' m getting teary-eyed . i said i would ! to cecil and carlos . i ' m proud to be able to call you family ! carlos : i said once that a home is just a grouping of object connected by a shared personal experience of time . which was just a fancy way of really just asking you to move in with me , and um , and it worked . but i was not wrong , and i know now that a relationship is just a grouping of moments connected by that same shared personal experience of time . what it means to make a life together is to take the experience of two different lives and choose to interpret them as a single shared narrative . so in other words , changing the story about you , or the story about me into a story about us . do you remember before the throat surgery , when i sounded like this ? carlos : science is neat . carlos : well , science is neat and i still believe that . but i know now that a lot of things are neat . having a quiet breakfast with another person is neat . calling someone over to experience a particularly noisy sunset is neat . this town is neat . night vale is neat . love is neat . love is , is very neat actually and um , and you are neat . that first night when we sat on the trunk of my car and looked at the lights above the arby ' s ? when i got up to leave i looked at you , and i tried to think of how to say everything i was feeling . but i ' ve never really been good at describing feelings , i ' m only good at describing facts , and love , love is not a fact . you know ? love , it ' s it ' s a hunch at first and then later it ' s a series of decisions , a lifetime of decisions . that ' s love . and , i did not , i did not know how to express that and so i just said : ` ` i ' m glad i decided to call you . '' and now , um , tonight , i say i ' m glad again , for this decision and , all the decisions that will come every day after . which is to say , scientific ally speaking of course , speaking from the point of view of mere facts and logic and you know , what with the science and all ... i just thought that it was time for us to make a life together . cecil : i guess it ' s my turn now . it ' s funny , iii make my living speaking to you all and now i ' m up here and - i do not quite know what to say ! in the last few years , we have experienced truly terrifying things . and wonderful things . we have lost our town , and regained our town . we have met new people , we have met incredible new people . i do not have to tell you that carlos has perfect hair , and teeth like a military cemetery , you have eyes , most of you . sorry , careless old woman . i-i do not need to tell you that his voice is oak y , or that his enthusiasm about science is inspiring and also deeply - exotic . so instead , i will tell you this . it has not always been an easy few years . but through it all , just just knowing that carlos was there . that no matter what else happened , we would come back to each other , holding hands like two kid s flirting on a first date . that ' s what kept me believing in this town . my love for night vale and my love for carlos are the same love . it is the love of someone who has given their life completely to something beyond themselves . i once described night vale as a friendly desert community , where the sun is hot , the moon is beautiful , and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep . and it still is . i know nowhere friendliest . i know nowhere hotter . the moon is still beautiful . mysterious lights still pass overhead , and carlos , i ca not wait for every night i get to pretend to sleep next to you . um , whew , that ' s it for the party . thanks to everyone who came and all the kind things you said . stay tuned next for a drunk , newly married couple , long after the well-wishers have left , piling up bags of garage and stacking chairs in a rented banquet hall , because they want to get their deposit back . lacy good night ! cecil : oh yes , thanks , lacy . and good night , night vale , and every person who can hear my voice , good night . today ' s proverb : it ' s always dark est before the dawn , we are often reassured by people who are totally wrong about how the sun works .
WTNV|Guidelines for Disposal|1 February 2017|you are swimming distance from a shore you can not see . if you choose the wrong direction , you will drown . if you do not make a decision , you will drown . welcome to night vale . despite an extensive public out reach campaign , there is still some confusion over which items are accepted at the new landfill facility that opened this fall in the barista district , to replace the old outdated landfill facility , also located in the barista district . mandatory annual spring cleaning day is just around the corner , so it ' s imperative that all citizens know how to properly dispose of the wreck age of their lives . i have some guideline from the sanitation department , received via the rheumatic tube that i discovered beneath the floorboards of my office , under layers of cement bricks , chains and padlocks , as if someone wanted to keep it sealed forever ! but before we get to that , the lost and found . a cell phone has been found in the drainage ditch on drainage ditch road . it contains no phone numbers of contact into , but there is a series of photo in the camera that i will now describe , so that the owner might recognize it . photo 1 : a close up of what looks like charred bone . photo 2 : a man in a horse suit staring directly into the lens . photo 3 : shapes in the dark , reaching . photo 4 : a puddle of viscous liquid , shot at a dutch angle in black and white . if this is your phone , you can claim it here at night vale community radio . another found item : a group of giant cardboard boxes have been found scattered haphazardly around the empty fields behind the abandoned missile si lo . for reasons they can not explain , night vale citizens have been crawling into the boxes . most have not come back . the few who did emerge describe the interior as an elaborate puzzle ma ze , ending in a complicated array of levers and deals , which must be engaged in the correct combination in order to regain freedom . when one escapee was asked by box-entering hopeful for a hint as to what the correct combination was , she responded snugly : ` ` the dissatisfaction of failure is equally important to the satisfaction of success . '' if these sound like your boxes , please pick them up from the field . if that sounds like your smugness , get a grip on yourself , lisa ! now , the official guideline from the sanitation department . please , do not bring any physical objects to the new landfill facility . you can bring any item that you no longer want , as long as it does not take up physical space . the physical objects must instead be brought to the old landfill which no longer exists , as it has been replaced by the new landfill which , as stated , will not accept physical objects . to clarify . you can not bring old television . you can not bring old refrigerator , you can not bring old cars . but . you can bring the idea of the backs eat where you lost your virginity . you can not bring old radius , but you can bring the song that reminds you of getting your braces tightened at the orthodontist , that same year when the popular bullies stole your school pictures to laugh loudly about how ugly you were . you can not bring your old braces , nor the bullies . but you can bring the beauty you eventually found in yourself by doing beautiful things . um.. there ' s a section for re cycling . this is where you can put things that are not currently useful to you , but might be turned into something more useful by someone else . like your current relationship , or your indifferent opinions about the godfather 1 and 2. you can bring any habitual destructive behavior . and also the sheer exhaustion of constantly working to contain it . you can bring the memory of the smell of the vanilla incense , if it reminds you of something that ' s not necessarily negative , but is nostalgic to the point of discomfort . you can not bring the smell itself , as smells are made up for matter , which is physical . there is a.. sealed chamber for all messages , e mails and missed calls that you dread returning . you may speak these messages into the chamber and simply walk away . more on these guideline in a moment , but first , a correction , sent to us via ham radio by listener lucinda pierre . in reference to our previous report on found items , lucinda informs me that a group of giant cardboard boxes is actually called a clattering of boxes . a group of complicated levers and deals is called a befuddlement of levers and deals , not an array , as i earlier report . we apologize for these errors , and remind lucinda pierre that a group of peasants is called a phlegmon . in sadder news , old woman josie has returned to the hospital with further complications from her broken hip last year . it seems that certain infections that were thought to be gone , are not gone . doctors said they were optimistic . although not necessarily about her case , just more in general . i will , of course , keep you constantly updated . back to the new landfill guideline . you can bring an entire year to the landfill . but you are limited to one per resident . so please make sure you ' re selecting the right year . we invite you to remember that a year that seems unique terrible could in fact be merely the gateway to an era of terror , the launching point and not the peak . choose wisely . remember , too , before you throw away an entire year , that any given unit of time also contains positive effects whose shape are not apparent yet . because the universe does not function in increments of human-made time , but on an unbroken plane of incidents and outcome . but all that said , feel free to throw out a year if you want . there is an area for dumping things that you are not yet sure if you regret . for example , this is where you can put the crush you have on your platonic friend . the moments where you catch yourself distracted by their mouth , when they ' re speaking instead of fully hearing them . the overcompensating excitement to display when they get a new partner ! and the satisfaction you suppress when they break up . this is where you put that one night when you were both a little drunk and ended up fool ing around . this is where you put the next morning , when you both pretended nothing happened , and you laughed and joked around like normal , or a slightly exaggerated version of normal . when they left for work in too much of a hurry , and you let your coffee get cold while you just sat there on the couch , wondering if you should text , but any message you could think of seemed to be distorted by cod ed significance . ` ` thanks for a lovely evening '' was too loaded , while simply ` ` left the key under the mat '' or ` ` good luck with your meeting '' was too casual , almost cold . but the absence of a message would also send a message . in the end , you settled on all three , placing ` ` thanks for a lovely evening '' in the middle of the other two , as one might put condemn on the check out between a roll of scotch tape and a few apples . you can not bring scotch tape nor apples here . please , stop bringing apples . they will not biodegrade here , nothing biodegrades here . apples are only accepted at the old landfill . which has been closed due to the opening of the new landfill . you can not bring piles of mysterious magnetic shavings that blew into your yard after that last big storm . but you can bring the sounds you heard in your house after the electricity went out . please , do not bring any lost cell phone nor a clattering of lost boxes . whew ! these goodwins are really detailed . maybe the sanitation department needs to get over itself . oh , i mean , i would never say that . be-be-being um , being an objective journalist but i can report that others might say it . reporting strong opinions that i ' ve never heard expressed by anyone else , but that someone somewhere might be thinking , is an important part of being an objective journalist . anyway . we pause now to bring you the weather . there is a place at the landfill where you can put that summer . you know , that summer ? you went to the beach that summer , everything seemed great . you had cool sun glasses that made you feel cool . everybody ' s coconut-scented bodies were sliding around on each other , and you did things you were not proud of . you do not remember what they were anymore , it was so long ago , but they ' re always there , those things . always hanging around in a sandy corner of your mind . along with the cool sun glasses you lost , when you stopped feeling cool . you remember that a black hole opened up in the sky that summer , over the waves , and no one else saw . you looked straight into it . it slid open and closed like the aperture of a camera . you felt a deep desire to be sucked into it , but no matter how hard you willed your body upward , you stayed stuck to the street , surrounded by the scream-bursts of people on the rollercoaster down the boardwalk , and the monotonous drone of the roving street peddler mumbling as if to himself . water , sun screen , umbrella . water , sun screen , umbrella . unsettled , you got a churro from a passing cart , and it did not sit well . in fact , it feels like that churro is still a part of you . you never digested it . it ' s still inside of you , attached to the lining of your stomach like a parasite . it might be growing . it might be absorbing your nutrient and gaining strength . and then there ' s the car , that charcoal-gray car that started following you afterwards . you could not prove anything , it was never closer than two blocks away . sometimes you think you still see it park ed across the street from ralph ' s when you come out with your groceries , or when you go to the bank . or when you ' re driving home from work . but then you think , no ! i ' m imagining things . and you drive out to your childhood home , which is now abandoned , and no one knows you go back there sometimes . and you fall asleep on the downstairs sofa while listening to the broken gate creaking in the wind . you vaguely remember you have to clean everything out of the house before demolition next week . you wonder how you ' re go n na get rid of all these things . i-i-i-i ca not bring the downstairs sofa or the broken gate to the new landfill facility , you think . but i could take those or other physical objects to the old landfill , except it ' s been closed because of the opening of the new landfill . you did a great job listening to the guideline from the sanitation department . another thing you ca not bring to the new landfill is the du ran du ran poster that you bought to hide the hole that you punched in your wall , after that summer that you went to the beach . mice began ne sting there almost immediately and reproducing at an alarming rate . every day after school you put on work gloves and peeled up the bottom of the poster and reached into the hole , and scoop ed out handful of baby mice , and threw them out your bedroom window in a frenzy , like pail ing water out of a sinking boat . you spent so much time doing this that your grades dropped and you lost weight . and still , you hear them scratching all night long , chewing , and shedding , and rustling , and reproducing . one day , you lifted the poster and instead of mice there was a black hole , a miniature of the one you saw over the water years before . it slid open and closed , like the aperture of a camera . you have not gone upstairs in years . you can not bring your mother ' s half-finished needlepoint that will never be completed , and so is now finished in its own way . you can not bring the stain on the carpet from when you and your friends stuck in a mixture of everyone ' s parents ' alcohol , collected in a jar , wine and gin and beer and tutuila . you can not bring your journals , but you can bring the secrets in them , even if they ' re written in a code that you can no longer decipher . you can bring the view from the attic that looks toward the high school track , where you would sit and watch a certain somebody during practice , and tell yourself it was not creep as long as you do not get the binoculars . you can not bring your long dead childhood dog ' s favorite tennis ball that you are not yet aware is under the downstairs sofa , where you still sometimes sleep when you imagine that the charcoal-gray car is following you . but where you will no longer sleep after the demolition next week . you can not bring your deceased pet . but you can bring the moment when she woke you up in the middle of the night with her last breaths , and you cried into her fur . you can bring the ghost of your grandmother that you saw many years before she died . you ca not bring the fox with human eyes , the one that they used to tell stories about at camp . the one that you saw running on two legs beside your car one foggy night when you were coming back from a party in college , and the next day you found out your grandmother died that night . you can bring recurring nightmare to the new landfill , but not fever dreams at this time . fever dreams must be taken to the re cycling center in pine cliff . you can bring the decay replacement dreams that you get when you are abducted by nonhuman or government officials that help you repress the memory of the actual abduction , but it is not recommended that you do so . those dreams serve a valuable purpose . there has also been some confusion about whether or not we take physical pain , because it is both physical and intangible . unfortunately , we do not have a way of processing this right now , but we are able to take the fear of pain , which we think you ' ll find counts for a lot . nothing that you bring here , of course , is truly lost . but it will remain hidden from view ... forever . please double check to make sure nothing you wish to keep is attached to anything you plan to discard . if you still have any questions about the items we do and do not accept , please call ahead before bringing them in , thank you for your cooperation , signed : the night vale sanitation department . well , listeners . i know i ' ll certainly be utilizing the new landfill this spring ! you know , i ' m finally go n na tackle the underground passage way that connect my basement to someone else ' s basement . i do not know whose basement it is . it would be inappropriate to walk upstairs into their kitchen to find out . there are certain social boundaries that must be observed to maintain order . but i know they have a lot of the same things that i have in my basement . stockpiled cases of the burning wood smoke flavor of la croix , all family photo of mine , my own voice heard faintly through the basement door anyway , that other basement is a nice place to go when i need to get away from it all . but a lot of emotional baggage accumulates in that passage way after a while , it really does . stay tuned next for a 12-hour binaural meditation track of a rain stick being used to tenderize meat . happy urging , night vale ! and good night . today ' s proverb : there ' s no harm in trying . really depends on what you ' re trying . either way , give it a go . it ' s probably fine .
WTNV|Love is a Shambling Thing|15 February 2017|look at it from the raindrops ' s point of view . welcome to night vale . yesterday , of course , was valentine ' s day , our first in four years , after that last valentine ' s day , which destroyed much of night vale and left many innocent victims buried under piles of rubble , and candy hearts . the city government built a large concrete dome over the hallmarks store in the minimal downtown , thus keeping its dangerous sentiment from leaking into the outside world . four employees of the store were unfortunately sealed inside , but there was just no time to remove them during the seven-month construction of the dome . it would have thrown everything off schedule . however , city council has a renewed interest in love , since starting their on-again off-again romance with the station management here at night vale community radio . currently their status is on , although they fight a lot , and their fights have caused considerable structural damage to the arby ' s and displaced a number of town citizens through time . so the council wants to create a controlled , safe , valentine ' s celebration , in order to impress station management . despite strong protests from the night vale citizens who do not believe there is any way to safely handle valentine ' s materials . city council announced yesterday that valentine ' s was a celebration of love , and deemed that the official slogan of the day was ` ` love is '' . more on that in a moment , but first , some listeners , i am sorry to have to report what i next have to report . old woman josie , your friend and mine but more my friend than yours , i , be-beyond carlos she is who i am closest with in this strange and friendly town of ours and she is ... well , she is under ho spice care at her home . there is no upside to this story , other than on the broadest , most distant view of time . this is not a surprise , but even with a long time to prepare for the worst , we are still in shock . as though we stepped out onto a sunny street and found ourselves falling into a lake , just on the liquid side of frozen and that is maybe the best way of describing it ? i feel cold , barely able to act . my words feel slow , my hands tremble . only josie seems not upset about her own condition , she lies on her bed surrounded by the beings who describe themselves as angels and the woman , alondra , who describes herself as josie ' s daughter . josie smiled and said , ` ` what a joy that i have gotten to live so long . what a relief that i do not have to live forever . '' anyone wanting to visit josie and say their goodby , um.. please dig a hole in your backward or any public garden , whisper your wishes for josie into it and the angels will hear you . i know it ' s illegal to acknowledge to acknowledge the existence of angels but right now i do not care . please understand that josie has limited strength and even more limited time and she may not be able to see you at all , i ... of course i will keep you updated . but the trajectory is certain . only the timeline is not known . i suppose the same is true for every person , but we are always surprised at the literal truth of it every time , over and over . and now listeners , the classified section . lost : months , all of them . reward if found . contact us by dealing numbers into your phone at random . if you were meant to reach us , you will . notice : that veiled woman who sits motionless in the shadows of un lit park s at 3 am gives really great relationship advice . bring raw meat and never look directly at her . the schedule of events at the public library is up . it ' s just your name , listed as an event once an hour , with the word ` ` canceled '' next to each . found : something that you will never notice is gone and that we will never return . you do not even remember having it , but you did have it , once . not anymore . the night vale psychic and medium society would like to let you know the answers to all your future questions . these answers , in order : the porch light . eight . because we could . a distant star . green . also green . we ' re sorry , but we have to . if you have any follow-up questions , then we wo not have done our job correctly . this has been the classified . the city council made careful preparations for a day of love . they put up streamers around city hall , and reserved a table at tourniquet for a fancy dinner date with station management . the rest of us also made preparations for valentine ' s by stocking up on bottled water and canned goods , and discussing with loved ones where we would meet if we needed to evacuate . several volunteer firefighters kept a brave watch for candy hearts , or teddy bears with anatomical correct glistening hearts stitched onto their bellies . the city council revised their earlier slogan saying they had misspoken . their slogan was not ` ` love is '' but ` ` love is a shambling thing '' . they nodded vehemently , whatever headline protrusion the multi-body entity uses to nod and repeated , ` ` love is a shambling thing '' , in a whisper before dissipating into the air like evaporating liquid . apparent leader of five-headed dragons , hadassah mcdaniels , has responded to the fatal shooting of one of her brother ' s five heads with an understandable mix of grief , and rage , and fire-breath . she has st aged a several week long protest outside of city hall , in which she peacefully held up signs and peacefully ate , hauled , or burned anyone attempting to enter or exist the building . there has still been no sight ing of word of hiram since the shooting . we reached out to the five-headed dragons to see if they had any up dates on that front , but they took our microphone from us and devoured it in a quick , twirling series of bites like it was a cob of corn . i did not get any follow-up to that , since i fled screaming before they could put me through the same treatment , but i will take this response as a sign that they also do not have news about hiram . hadassah has said that she seeks justice . specifically , the justice she seeks is pain inflicted on night vale equal to or greater than the pain inflicted upon her own soul . she said , ` ` you do not understand the true nature of your splintered world . there are terrible forces surrounding you held together in a fragile truce . that truce will end , and with it , your town . '' then she saw jeremy godfrey emerge from city hall , there to pay a small municipal fine for wearing fashionable sweaters , and she set his hair on fire . and now a word from our sponsors . today ' s show has been brought to you by sears . sears would like you to know that they offer quality products at low prices . and also that there was a miscommunication and they thought this was a television station . they prepared a to ad and are not sure what to do now . um , i guess we ' ll just describe what you would have seen , had you seen this commercial on to . this is not the level of quality we want you to think of when you think of sears , but here goes . exterior : a house . snow drift down onto yard already piled with snow . a warm glow on the snow , reflected light . we pan up . it is the light from the house ' s windows . so copy , so warm ! why would anyone ever want to leave and go to sears ? what kind of commercial is this ? wait , stick with us . interior : living room . a woman looks out the window , bites her lip . ` ` bad weather , '' she thinks . ` ` i ' m not going outside . '' we do not hear this as narration , the performer expresses this with her face , she ' s a great actor . i wish you could have seen her , she does not even talk in this commercial , all visual performance it ' s , what a waste . so bad weather , she does not want to go outside . she goes to the computer , loads up amazon . it ' s not amazon , because we do not want to advertise another company , but it ' s like clearly amazon , you know ? we see her click ing on stuff , stuff she could be buying at sears , but is instead buying on amazon . flash forward a day . she got next day shipping , i guess . same house exterior , it ' s still snowy , the snow is high , the pavement is icy . a mail truck pulls up . a mail carrier gets out . he has her package . we see her in the window , so happy about her decision to buy from amazon . he starts up the drive to her , he slips on the ice . her package goes flying . it says ` ` fragile '' in the package , so that ' s probably ruined . he falls badly , fractures his leg in three places ! we do not know this just by looking at it , but the film ing of the stunt did not go like it was supposed to , so i can tell you : fractured in three places . horror on her face . she does a great job acting this scene , i really wish you could have seen it . we ' re now in a court room . she ' s being sued ! the jury looks stern . she ' s going to love . all of her savings will go to the mail carrier , but he is not happy either . he is in incredible daily pain , and what is money going to do to fix that ? no one . is . happy . we fade out on the two of them at their separate tables in court , both facing a future that is diminished , that is diminishing . next time , get in your car and go to sears . this has been a message from your sponsor . back to our valentine ' s report . how was it ? honestly , uneventful . casualties were limited to a few neighborhoods , and only two out of three gas mains exploded . most of the town is not completely burning , only a little scorched . as far as valentine ' s goes , it was a huge success . the date between city council and station management also went well , as far as we can tell . tourniquet ' s entire building was enveloped in a thick fog that pulsed a strange blue , and there was the reverberate harmony of a children ' s choir . when the fog lifted , every human customer in the restaurant had vanished and were replaced by figures shrouded in white cloth , slowly twirling in place . city council and station management were entertaining their tarso appendages and cooing . ugh . oh , it does seem i got the slogan for yesterday wrong again . it was actually ` ` love is a shambling thing , grey-faced and gasping . '' ah , that ' s pretty good branding . it ' s very romantic . wait , what was that ? oh , i ' m being told that that ' s still wrong . ok , hold on , let me figure this out . and in the meantime , let ' s get to that weather . ` ` love is a shambling thing , gray-faced and gasping . it moves in from the west , the setting sun behind it . those who see it avert their eyes . love stumbled and shutters , love grasps but is not grasped . it sees a man , and the man does not look away . love reaches out a gray hand . the man touches the band just lightly , just on the palm , and the man feels heat inside of him . his heart is on fire . this is not a metaphor . his heart is on fire and so , soon , is his skin , his hair , his teeth become more and more visible as his face shrinks and melts away . love watches dispassionate . love does not love what it does , love only does it . love does not have eyes and neither , now , does the man . love is a shambling thing . it limbs through a window into an infant ' s bedroom . when one of the mothers comes in to check on her baby son , there is love too in the crib , curled up inside him . love murmurs , and the baby spits restlessly . the baby does not burn , the baby will eventually burn , but by then he will not be a baby . the woman looks down at the ghastly form of love curled up beside her son and she thinks , ` ` what have i done ? '' she cries , not because she is happy or sad , but because that is what her body needs to do next . love rises from the crib and passes her without a glance . love is a shambling thing . it shambles out of her home . love , with skin that peels and pop s and joints that moan and snap , limbs to the top of a tall building and surveys its surroundings . so many people . it opens its mouth . its teeth are the only part of its body that look new and healthy . it has so many teeth ! it yelps and howls , an inarticulate sermon of lost and loss , and everyone hears it . they hear it as a shudder in their stomach and hit ch in their step . love does not eat or drink , love separates its many teeth and consumes . love is a shambling thing , grey-faced and gasping . it moves out to the east , the night drawing closed behind it . those who see it avert their eyes . '' so that ' s the final version of the city council ' s slogan for valentine ' s day . it's.. um.. it ' s catch ? they also sent over their current draft for a night vale valentine ' s day lo go design . it ' s not really a lo go per se , it ' s an actual physical rusty bear trap , hidden in a set position below a pile of loose tissue paper in an disclosed truck stop restroom . and i like it . again , great branding . it ' s very eye-catching , depending on how you look at it . we seem to have all made it through this valentine ' s day , except those of us who did not , but any given day there are those of us who did not make it . every day is a new opportunity for danger . every day is another day survived . every survival , another chance for love . from one who loves to all of you out there ho love , good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : live every day like it ' s your first .
WTNV|Ash Beach|1 March 2017|we make money the old-fashioned way . we chemicallyconvert lead into gold . welcome to night vale . the night vale tourism board announced that after years of super-fond site clean up , ash beach reopened today to the public . the tourism board ' s new brochure shows a young happy family having a picnic lunch and wearing respiratory masks , building ash cast les and flying kit es against the blackened sky . we ' re padlocked here in the desert with no body of water insight , so back in the 1950 ' s , the city decided to create a public beach madeentirely out of municipal ly burned books that were deemed too dangerous or too boring to reach . carlos and i are so excited about the reopening of the beach . we are already planning a trip in the next few weeks with the family.according to the tourism board , there will be a refurbished boardwalk therewith food truck s and carnival games . beachgoers can stroll down the pier and watch the suffers lie on their boards , as we all wait for the ocean to risedramatically enough that night vale finally has a waterfront . this friday night , dark owl records will be ho sting an album release party for steve ray afghan ' s new album called ` ` beyond '' . which a collection of instrumental covers of leonard cohens ' s greatest hits.vaughan ' s unique approach to music has always been to asked instrumentsaltogether and simply read the name of each chord aloud . afghan will be at the store taking series with fan s and asking everyone how he got here , and why cannot hold tangible objects . sunday at the rec center is the annual gun showsponsored by the night vale chapter of the n ra . all patrons receive a freetrucker hat that reads ` ` guns do not kill people , unless you shoot those peoplewith said gun and then they die . but other than that one specific situation , we ' ve never known a gun to kill anybody .

'' john said jim held up an old football . ` ` it ' s from when we was kid s , johnny ! '' jim said of a memory instigated by a physical object inside john ' s memory from today something that did not happen earlier this week . john and jim went out intothe untilled fields of imaginary corn and tossed the ball around for nearly hour . john said he wished this memory was real . his brother ' s been off serving in the blood space war for nearly 40 years now . ` ` he probably ai not evenarrived at whatever planet he ' s supposed to fight yet . what with the , destructive limitations on matter as it approaches the speed of light , '' johnsaid , sadly reminiscing about his long-lost sibling . ` ` i bet they got ta be in akin da frozen space sleep or something like in that documentary , ‘ aliens ' , '' headed . listeners , if you ' re at ash beach , try not to look at the thin beings coming up from the ashes . hide from their pointing hands , and above all , do not trust the memories they fill your mind with . they are untrue , they are fever dreams . they . are . lies . wait , in fact i ' m just now getting word from witnessesthat large waves are crashing down on ash beach . there ' s no indication where the water is coming from as night vale , again , is in a desert . some beachgoersbegan tearing hoods off cars and using them as surf boards . someone has spelled out ` ` help lost '' in sea weed , but the crashing waves washed it all away . manypeople are being dragged out into a nonexistent sea by a dangerous undertow.where is this water coming from ? until we know for certain , stay away from ash beach . more soon , but now the weather . the tide has ebbed , the beach is clear . the ashes are gone , washed out to well . oh , not well as in i do not know what to say in next , i meant well as in an old well , that appeared in the same spot it had stood two summer ago , draining the water into it in a direct reversal of awe ll ' s usual role and then vanishing again , as old well ' s often do . well . ash beach is neither ash nor beach anymore.simply a great expanse of sand and less and dry . those who saw the shimmeringapparitions said the memories they were given are as real as ever . they weren merely daydreams , nor vivid hallucinations , they are actual events whatever happened . simone rigid eau , the transient who lives in the earthsciences building of the night vale community college and who recently beganteaching courses there , much to the chagrin of the college administration , said she was at ash beach today and she saw the figures . she saw their pointing , wriggling translucent appendages , she saw their numerous flat teeth in theirlong gray mouths , she saw their bulbous white eyes , she heard the sound of crunching like chewing egg shells , and she had a memory . she remembered the college camp us . she remembered it was 1983. she remembered students withboomboxes , trans-am muscle cars . she remembered the news anchors that day , tim and tr in , with their feathered-hair double-windsor necktie , shoulder pads , and deep maroon nail polish . she remembered the news of missiles already launched , apologies for a miscommunication , a mistake in a training drill . apologies not accepted . missiles launched to retaliate . she remembered the news anchors tim and tr in trying not to cry , trying to report the news . she remembered students and faculty gathered around the television , trying not to cry , trying receive the news . she remembered ... the world ending . not with a bang , not with whisper , but with silence . the absence of thought and feeling . everyone wentmissing all at once together – time , body , memory ... gone . simone then said she remembered something else , frothy new memory she received today . a woman with a deer mask had appeared on the television screen , her face flickering through the loud static and obscuringthe faces of tim and tr in . she spoke in a language unknown to simone but ... she recognized the name of the woman . huntokar . ` ` oh , i know huntokar , '' i said . ` ` she did this , cecil , '' simone said . ` ` huntokar is super weird , '' i said , ` ` makessense that she would be behind this whole ‘ ash beach ' thing . '' ` ` i ' m not talkingabout the beach , '' simone said . ` ` then what are you talking about ? '' i said . ` ` sheds the destroyed ! '' simone said , shaking her head . simone said she remembered the world ending , it was so clear , so vivid . but it did not end . she touched marm and said that we are here . how are we here ? i told simone , ` ` you always say the world ended in 1983 , i do not see how this is so special for you . '' she said , '' i knew it ended . i just could not remember it ending . now i do . the worldended , cecil , i saw it on the news ! '' ` ` oh then it must be true , '' i said . ` ` are you being sarcastic ? '' she asked . ` ` why would i do that ? '' i replied . ` ` i still can'ttell if you are or not , '' she said , eye ing me auspiciously . i do not understand what she was getting at . whatever our truth , night vale , you can feel yourbody . hear my voice . see the sunlight through dissipating ash clouds . i do not know if we are real . but we are alive . we are tangible , feeling , and whole . stay tuned next for the sound of something trying to dig its way out of yourchest . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : if you ' re not wearing a denis vest , then this conversation is over .
WTNV|The Hierarchy of Angels|15 March 2017|i know you are , but what am i ? what am i ? what am i ? what . am . i ? welcome to night vale . i should start today with something happy . in his speech yesterday honoring the life of old woman josie , larry le roy out on hedge of town , and josie ' s closest neighbor , told a story about his pickupbreaking down a few years ago . josie had stopped on the roadside to help him push the old they the mile or so to his house . in the last few hundred feet , the truck picked up momentum on the slop ed road , and it rolled out of their controlinto a large cactus . they heard a surprised yelp , and saw telly the barberwide-eyed and sweating , holding a pair of hears . josie and larry laughed and laughed . even the surprised telly laughed . larry then asked telly why he was cutting that cactus ' hair . telly gulped and ran away , still laughing and sweating profusely . larry told the gathered mourners that he did not havemany friends in town , but old woman josie was always kind to him . always as mile , always happy to help . always good for a giggler when she caught tellygiving cacti haircuts . the services were beautiful , you know that . you were all there . we were all there . i know i said gathered mourners but in a way , we were gathered celebrate , extolling the great life of a great woman , now gone . today is the scattering of her ashes and the city is working to fulfiljosie ' s wishes . they are joined in this endeavour by several beings claiming to be angels . the city is trying to ignore the angels ' request to help because it is illegal to acknowledge the existence of angels , so ... we ' ll see how this goes . the dozens of five-headed dragons , who came to our world after the blotched , yet partially successful execution of fellow dragonhiram mcdaniels , are still in town . hiram ' s sister , hadassah , had promisedvengeance for the wrongfully murder of hiram ' s violet head . but after severalweeks of setting fire to local business es , and devouring a few of the moremuscular human citizens , the dragons have gone mostly silent . theiraggression ' s now limited to some blatant jay walking and loitering . there hasten one report of an identified five-headed dragon hurling a crumpled frescacan basketball-style at a trash bin , missing the trash bin wildly , and thenpicking the soda can up and gently tossing it into the bin , only to have clumsily fall out and back onto the ground . onlookers were shocked to see that the dragon did not even attempt a third put-back , and the can is still lying on the ground this very moment . the can is still . on the ground . mayor cardinal has called on the sheriff for stricter enforcement of minor offenses , so they do not escapade into more sinister crimes . plus , she added , if we do not cleanlitter from our curbs , the street cleaner might show up , and we simply cannotafford the loss of innocent lives that would cause . more on this as develops . josie ' s daughter alondra ortiz , who came to town lastyear to be with her ailing mother until josie passed away , is now sortingthrough josie ' s estate and documents . alondra said she found no will injosie ' s files , only a piece of paper that said : ` ` it all belongs to the angels . ` ` but alondra noted the handwriting was written shakily in thick magic marker , and every word but ` ` it '' and ` ` the '' was misspelled . she believes the beings proclaim to be angels wrote this , not her mother . the angels responded , ` ` nuh-uh '' , and then nervously wiped their brows with clearly ink-stained hands . alondrahired in an estate lawyer to help sort out liquidation of her mother ' s assets.alondra said she just wants to be done with all this and go back home . whenasked where home was , alondra responded , ` ` i do not remember . why ca not remember ? that ' s not important , i mean it ' s super-important but not to thisdiscussion . oh god , what is wrong with me , with this town ? '' a single-engineplane then flew across the horizon behind her , trailing a banner that read , '' oooh ! i found some teeth ! '' listeners , some of you have asked about our inter , kareem . he ' s been at the station for so long , about 16 months , much longer than any other inter in recent memory . well , i ' m sorry to report he ' s no longerwith us . he was a good inter and he will be missed . kareem changed major fromcommunications to earth sciences and no longer needs this radio internship . he is taking classes with professor simone rigid eau at night vale communitycollege . simone is not actually employed by neck , and in one of kareem ' s lastjournalistic endeavours here at the station , he even found a copy of her deathcertificate , dated 1983 , although she does not show any signs of being a ghost.but apparently her knowledge of earth sciences intrigued kareem enough that he wanted to change career trajectories . kareem told me on his last day , which was today , like five minutes before i started my broadcast is when i find out aboutthis . he told me simone knows what happened to night vale , why kareem ' s familydoes not know him anymore , and why he ca not find michigan , or whatever is homestate is , on a map . i ' m just happy kareem is pursuing his dreams , even if he'sgonna lose al ll those journalism credits ! and today ' s filing will have to be done by an overwork ed radio host before he gets to go home to his husband go n na be a looong path to that degree , kareem ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great . listeners , i d like to caution you away from drivingnear downtown . road crews have shut down all streets in all directions , as construction team is building a series of elaborate rollercoasters and amusement park rides , many of which do dives and loops around , under , and through the surrounding buildings and even roads . it ' s complete gridlock al lover downtown , with cars unable to drive into or out of the jam . on the plusside , there ' s a pretty cool looking aquaman ride that does a double-twistingloop through a large pool of water that is elevated more than 50 feet off the ground . mayor cardinal is on the scene arguing with the construction team abouttheir lack of development permits . the construction crew , who are all tallglowing beings with wings , showed the mayor a piece of paper that said , ` ` thesis all totally fine , josie said we can build this , ok ? signed , city '' , written a magic marker and nearly every word misspelled . allondra ortiz ' lawyer , emilie avare , filed injunction to halt the work , saying that the funds used toward the construction these rollercoasters were part of josie ' s estate , and were beingmisappropriated by the so-called angels . there is no documentation showingjosie wished her money to be spent this way , avare explained . reconstruction team then mumbled , ` ` a dummy says what ? '' and avare said , ` ` what ? ` ` and they all laughed , including the mayor who then added , ` ` yeah but yeahseriously , you need building permits , even if you are fulfilling the elaboratewishes of the deceased . '' we ' ll have more on this soon , but first , a quickbreak . hi , this is cecil . leave a message ! steve carlsberg : hello , cecil ? it ' s steve . ok , i ' m not sure if you ' re there or not . last few times i called , you said to leave message at the tone , and then halfway into my message you interrupted me and said , ` ` ha ha , steve . you fell for it again . '' so i ' m justmaking sure you ' re actually there this time . i have something i wanted to telly so you could report it on your show . are you there , cecil ? i do not wannafall for your trick again . ok . well . i was getting some coffee over at the spikyhammer , and i held the door for this woman i did not recognize . she just stared me , did not say thank you or anything . i mean , i do not hold doors for approval , it ' s just a nice thing to do , but she effort ed to not thank me , you know ? and then when i stood in line , she stood right next to me , her facejust inches from mine , staring at me . i tried not to look , it ' s not nice to stare . she did not say anything for the longest time , but right as i placed my order , a large crab legs macchiato with ( qu ad shot ) and whipped cream , restarted whispering loudly in my ear ! i could not understand what she was saying , and it made it difficult to talk to the barista . and then , when i turned to ask her politely if she wanted me to get her something , she was gone . oh i wish could remember what the woman said . oh gosh . it was something like , hmmmmmmmmmm.. the woman from italy has come back to town . nothing can stop her from tearing it down ! she lives for your screams , makes meals of your tears . she revels in chaos and deals in your fears . we all huddled and hide from the pain yet to come , huddled hidden with loved ones , perhaps she ' ll spare some . she brings the torture , the trouble , the stress , scan you order for her a double express ? well i do not remember what she said . if i think of it , i ' ll call you back . anyway , sorry i missed you cecil ! cecil : i ' m here , steve ! you totally fell for it . steve : oh , oh ! oh-ho-ho-ho , you got me ! cecil : basic stuff , steve . steve : sure is ! wo w , you got me good ! cecil : i tease you because i love you , steve . steve : aww , cecil . i love you too , big brother ! cecil : just bidding , i ' m not here ! please leave your message after the tone . steve : hello ? cecil , i ' m not sure what just happened . guess i ' ll try again later . – sorry of the interruption . oh , looks like i got avoicemail . oh , it ' s from steve carlsberg . well , never mind , there ' s breakingnews right now . stay far away from downtown , listeners . the traffic jam caused by the halted construction project is in great danger . the cars arehonking noisily , people are abandoning their vehicles , but the sheriff is asking everyone to seek immediate shelter . several dragons are converging on the scene . the dragons have everyone in the congested area completelysurrounded . they are walking – no , stomping toward the helpless citizenstrapped in traffic . night vale , do not go out on the roads . the dragons have exactly where they want us . what a disastrous trap ! be safe . and as i try to find out more on what ' s happening indowntown , please hear this important weather report . here is the secret hierarchy of angels . deceased humans can become angels , but few humans do.angels are immortal beings , but not all of them are former human souls . some are animals , some plants . some outdated electronics . they are all named erika with a k all angels are equal to all other angels.they share all memories and all physical sensations . they experience everythingsimultaneously . their minds are overwhelmed with enlightenment and pain . they have no centralized leadership , but they do have committees , lots committees . these committees do not have titles nor objectives . the committeessimply emerge as needed . angels are wealthy , but do not understand currency . theywill often ask to borrow 10 bucks . angels have no bodies , only visual projections of winged , barely humanoidforms . these forms are dreamed up by those who see and acknowledge them , and may vary based on the viewer . the secret hierarchy of angels is an eternal mass of feelings and thoughtsmade manifest by necessity . they ' re only individual beings because we imaginethem so , but they are collectively beings . it is illegal to speak of or acknowledge in any way the secret hierarchy of angels . but . i. will . acknowledge it . here , on the radio . inman objective journalist , which does not mean i have no morals or opinions , justthat i can be self-aware of my bases and emotions , yet still report a storytransparently to you . you may not agree with my point of view , but i will do . my.best . to give you the information you need to decide that on your own . in the case of the angels , i acknowledge them . i seethed ! and because josie always said such , i too believe that they are realbeings , and are entitled to josie ' s estate . so does five-headed dragon miriamadelman . she ' s a lawyer , and the angels hired her to represent their case for management of josie ' s will . oh , the dragons did not do any harm to those traffic today . they were simply the legal team coming to help facilitate josie'sfinal wish , which was to build a night vale sculpture garden , complete with the usual rollercoasters and tilt-a-whirls , and an enormous ferris wheel . josie wanted to have her ashes scattered underneath ( jacob man zu ' s ) famous sculpture , ` ` top thrill dragster '' , which is a400-foot drop and reaches over 120 miles per hour . adelman and her legal teammanaged to push through the sculpture garden construction , which is now complete , and josie ' s ashes have finally been honored in the way she wanted . alondra ceded this ground because she understood how important this town was tojosie . but she added , ` ` my mother ' s home , her belongings , her money , her legacy these are all i have of my family . i have no siblings , no cousins , and parents . i am the only ortiz left . i do not know or understand night vale , '' alondra said . ` ` i do not believe in angels , nor dragons for that matter , i justwant what is left of my mother ' s memory , and then i want to go home , wherever that is . '' the city has declined to hear further arguments about estate ownership fromadelman or her angel clients , as the dragons are not licensed to practice law anywhere on this earth , and their clients , the angels , do not legally exist . the secret hierarchy of angels is a cloud of knowledge , formed from the collected experiences of the deceased . josie might be amongthem now , or she might know . all i know is that josie loved night vale and beloved her . i am going to go to the sculpture garden today to pay my respects . carlos and i will hold hands and lay flowers at the ash-strewnbase of ( man zu ' s ) towering masterpiece of contemporary sculpture . and then , we will purchase a souvenir photo of ourselves screaming in joy and sorrow , whileengaged in a 120-mile per hour freewill , demonstrating our fervent artsadovacy , exactly as josie would have wanted . i hope all of you will join me in honoring not only the life of josefina ortiz , but the lives of the angels who loved her too . stay tuned next for hosts josh and chuck and theirwildly popular show , ` ` stuff you should not know '' , which as usual will be unbroken reduction bee p for 30 straight minutes . no one has ever heard josh chuck speak . and as always , good night , night vale . josie was beautiful and angels are real ! good night .
WTNV|What Happened at the Smithwick House|1 April 2017|if you could press a button that would give you a great deal of money , but it would cause someone you do not know in a distant part of the world to die , then you would have a good model for how our current economy works . welcome to night vale . to start off , the story that everyone is talking about . in the interest of the common good , i feel i must report to you what happened at the smith wick house . mr . and mrs smith wick lived in a neat two-story home on butter field lane . they had two small children , lisa and jake . their lives were mostly normal . mr . smith wick was a gloomy man . he had an anger inside of him . he had not used this anger to do anything , but mrs smith wick could smell it , and the children could smell it . they were always very careful around mr . smith wick . sometimes it would be a day , just any day , and they would turn to find him looking at them with a blank stare , and they would feel as though entering on the edge of something wild and final . and then they would look again and it would just be solid mr . smith wick going about this day . even the neighbors could smell it . there was always something dark hanging over the smith wick house . they never consciously thought but always felt . and because of this , they stayed away . mrs smith wick was often lonely since few neighbors would talk to her . mr . smith wick was never lonely . he did not have the capacity for loneliness . one day , mrs smith wick discovered she was pregnant . an accident . and how would they care for a third child ? but they would . there would be no choice . dutifully , mr . smith wick began to prepare a nursery in what had previously been a guest room . he moved out the furniture that had only ever been used for guests once - a visit from a cousin three thanksgiving before , never repeated . he was in the process of painting the room a soothing green , when he first saw the hole in the wall opposite the wall . he called in the other members of the family , because the hole was so truly odd . perfectly square and opening onto a tunnel that was also square . the tunnel ' s sides were a cool damp concrete , leading away into darkness . on the other side of the wall was the outside of the house , but the hole seemed to lead somewhere very distant , although it was too dark to see . a soft breeze came from the hole . it was too small to enter , only about a foot on each side , so the family stood in the unfinished nursery looking at the hole . mr . smith wick thought he could hear from far in the distance of its depths a soft humming . more soon . but first , as many of you probably heard , two weeks ago i was arrested , after my explanation of the secret hierarchy of angels . ah em . i was dragged in front of the city council and informed i would be sent through a lengthy re-education and brain reconditioning program , before i would be allowed back on the air . but then i got city council chatting about how station management is doing , their relationship is on a little bit of an icy patch again . and i see station management on a daily basis , so it was pretty easy to draw the council into a series of questions about what management ' s mood has been like and how many capless employees of the station have been lured to the management ' s office , and relieved of their life energy . finally , the council forgot what they had called me in to punish me about and let me go . so here i am , speaking to you once again . by the way , there is a difference between a rough patch and an icy patch in a relationship . a rough patch is where there is a great deal of arguing and disagreement , a ( chostle ) to both parties ' lives . an icy patch is where outwardly all seems to be smooth , but there is no actual connection made . simple sentiments skitter off in unintended directions and both parties feel like they ' re lurching without control towards destination they had not foreseen . the angels , meanwhile , continue to fight for a legal acknowledgment of their existence . they ' ve been protesting outside city hall , blocking the entrance . now this has made life extremely difficult for city hall employees . the employees are unable to get inside the building , but since angels do not legally exist , these employees are also unable to accurately describe the reason for their absence from work . the angels have called on our unions , including the steel workers ' union , the taxi drivers ' union , the tree shrub and moss union , to join them in a general strike until the denial of their basic identity is finally purged from the books of law . and now your children ' s fun fact science corner . today , we will look at birth stones . if you were born in january , your birth stone is the garnet . if you were born in february , your birth stone is also the garnet . you have to fight with january to see who gets to have the garnet . whoever wins gets to be born . that ' s how birth works . if you were born in march , your birth stone is , that ' s right – the garnet . this is going to be a brutal battle for that stone . if you were born in april , your birth stone is flat and gray and sits next to a pond . it is dusty and warm in the sunshine , and if you put it against your cheek , it would feel like taking a long walk on a nice day . if you were born in may , your birth stone is cement ed into the wall of a rich person ' s indoor shower . this stall has several different shower heads and built-in surround sound speakers , and your stone is near where the person ' s butt usually goes . i ' m sorry to have to inform you of this . june , your birth stone is this one that i have in my hand . if you want it back , then you need to listen very carefully and do everything i say . july , you do not have a birth stone , you have a birth rock . it ' s in a park in san diego and children sit on it to tie their shoes . august , your birth stone is in space ! a s hard broken off of an osteoid that is spinning away from the sun . thousands of years from now , your birth stone will leave the solar system . september , your birth stone was swallowed by a little boy who is very sorry about having swallowed a stone . swallowing a stone is uncomfortable and dangerous . a lesson that little boy is learning now . october , your birth stone was buried by drifting soil thousands of years ago . it will never again be uncovered . november , your birth stone is falling from a great height . soon it will land . i hope it will not land on anyone but then , life has no guarantees . december . your birth stone is a dump truck . you may correctly notice that this is not a type of stone , but you may also correctly notice that at least you did not get stuck fighting over a garnet . this been the children ' s fun fact science corner . and now back to what happened at the smith wick house . a few days after the discovery of the hole , mrs smith wick disappeared . she did not pack any of her clothes . there was no sign of violence . she was just ... gone . the children , lisa and jake , did not cry . they were too shocked to cry . they realized without realizing that they had passed through a threshold that there would be no way to ever return . mr . smith wick called the police , who investigated thoroughly . he tried to tell them about the hole , still in the wall of the unfinished nursery upstairs , but they were uninterested in that . they wanted to know where he had been last night and if he could prove it . he had been with the children . they said so as well . the police did not like it . but they could not find evidence of a crime , let alone evidence that any specific person had done a crime , and so they left . mr . smith wick took the children to school on his way to work . he made dinner that night . he felt as though he should be searching for his wife , but something in him did not seem to find that urgent . instead , he went into the nursery , painted a green he now found overbearing . the hole was where it had been before . he listened closely . yes , still the humming from deep in the darkness . he bent over and looked , but in the depth of its perfectly square tunnel he could see only shadow . then , there was a gurgle , a movement coming toward him . and he stumbled backwards , and a stream of clean fresh water begun to pour from the hole . and now , traffic . i have never seen snow in person , and yet i can taste it . i know its bite , but i have never felt it . we go places we never go . we achieve what we do not achieve . this is the power of imagination . is imagination a blessing , or a prison ? would i be more driven to seek out snow if i could not imagine snow ? if i could not project in my stomach what a ride down a hill might feel like , would i be compelled to seek out a slope and a s led ? does imagining make me less likely to act ? here is what i think . imagination might hold us back , but the exchange is worth it . by imagining , i can experience things that not only have not happened , but could not happen . for instance , i will imagine an event now . a.. creature with a long forehead and , wide golden eyes on the planet.. zardaz , in a galaxy that is not even visible from our galaxy , this this creature who is named ersdawn is on trial for the crime of having viewed the sacred animal . tom..pet of the queen of zardaz , when asked to defend themselves , ersdawn looked over the assembled citizens of zardaz . all six of them . it is an hospitable planet , and their population is very low . ` ` have we not all , at one time or another , viewed tom , the sacred animal ? have we not all ? '' ersdawn asks . it turns out they have not all . no one has ever seen tom before , not even the queen , and the queen is annoyed at this . and ersdawn is tossed off a cliff , and the population of zardaz.. is now five . what would our lives be without the ability to imagine nonsense like that ? anyway , there ' s a patch of falling snow on route 800 that scientists can not explain , given that the rest of the region is currently in the usual early spring heat wave . i have never seen snow in person , but can imagine exactly what that snow looks like , and so feel no urge to go check it out . this has been traffic . more on what happened at the smith wick house . the children were gone . they had not attended school in days . mr . smith wick could not say where they were . he expressed utter confusion . the police did not believe this and arrested him . he sat quietly in his cell , and when they were forced to let him go because there was no evidence of his involvement , he quietly went home . the neighbors avoided him , but they had always avoided him . the police left a car outside his house indefinitely . he went about his days as he always had . he made breakfast , he went to work , he made dinner , he went to bed . his wife and children were missing . he did not look for them . instead , he went each evening to the nursery , where the hideous green paint on the wall now seemed an act of violence upon him . and he sat cross legged on the floor , looking at the hole . the air coming from within was cold , like air from a cave . one evening , after several weeks of this , he stood and reached his arm into the hole . he felt something soft rush his fingers . he cried out and tried to grasp it . it felt like the faintest touch of a hand . he stretched his arm as far as it would go , and found a finger hold . he pulled it . what he had felt in the tunnel moved easily with his pull . to his astonishment , his arm emerged holding the branch of a tree , several feet long , covered in leaves the same shade as the wall . he sat back down . he did not try to reach into the hole again . soon , the rest of what happened at the smith wick house , but now the weather . mr . smith wick no longer went to work . he did not make breakfast or dinner , he did not sleep . he sat in the nursery and looked at the hole . from deep in the tunnel , he heard humming . the neighbors noticed that he did not go out anymore , and they assumed the worst about this . they confirmed with each other that there had been something heavy and strange about the man . they agreed that this had all been a matter of time . time did not matter to mr . smith wick anymore . he did not notice if it was day or if it was night . inside the tunnel , leading away from the unfinished nursery , it was always the same : dark and cool . when no one had seen mr . smith wick for several days , the police in the car outside decided to investigate . earlier this week , they searched the house but there was no trace of mr . smith wick . all of his things were still there , and there was no sign of violence , he was just gone . one of the police officers wandered into the nursery , where the green paint on the walls resembled a person turning ill . it did not appear that anyone had been in the room for days . there was no hole in the wall . evidence was searched for , and evidence was not found . the smith wick house stands empty , with all of the family ' s things still inside – furniture and clothing . even the food , rotting in the refrigerator . the neighbors still shake their heads and say that this just goes to show ... although none of them understand what it went to show . and that is what happened at the smith wick house . if there was anything to be learned from this , i ... refuse to learn it . carlos has called in to the station to let me know that he is thinking quinoa balls for dinner . also to remind me that the ` ` dancing on the stars '' final is tonight and also to say that what happened at the smith wick house happened a long time ago , and he has no idea how it happened . again . and i told him that this is definitely the first time anything like this happened in night vale , i mean hata ah , i would have remembered something this weird happening in our quiet little town . but he insisted that he studied the smith wick case already almost four years ago . he does not understand how the whole incident could have repeated exactly as it happened before . reality does not allow for that , he said . well . i suppose there ' s no accounting for reality . stay tuned next for a look back at your life , featuring the most embarrassing moments and biggest failures , host ed by your own brain . if you miss this showing , do not worry ! it plays on a nightly repeat . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : you are what you eat . that ' s very confusing phrasing . let me simplify : you consume your own flesh . much clearer .
WTNV|Filings|15 April 2017|why do birds suddenly appear , every time you are near ? tell me more about your special bird powers . welcome to night vale . it ' s been a long couple of weeks , as the city-wide emergency sirens that signal illegal public acknowledgment of angels have been blaring almost non stop . but in spite of these armchair laws , i ' ve been shouting ` ` you ' re an angel ! '' at beings who look like angels and then making my most friendly finger-pointing gesture . the beings who call themselves angels because ... that ' s what they are , have begun filing the paperwork for official existence . the angels are still at the hall of public records downtown waiting in line . they have made it to the front of line three different times , but each time , they were told they were missing a key form of id or pre-application paperwork , or that the camera could not record their image . they were not told his using words , the records hall clerk just stabbed their paperwork repeatedly with scissors and then got a massive nosebleed , which is how they know their application was declined . other citizens waiting have grown restless . as they do not acknowledge the existence of angels , the next person in line keeps walking up to a seemingly empty window , only to be brushed away by a clerk , or an angel . these citizens have begun shouting and crumbling and curling into little balls and sobbing , as large glowing cracks appear in the ceiling . it ' s been several days of waiting in line for the angels . we ' ll check back in on them soon . oh , i have a new inter , listeners . he ' s a fine-looking young man with a beautiful voice , i think he ' ll have a great future in radio . i ' ve been trying to ask him his name or who hired him . i certainly do not remember beginning the search for a new inter , he just appeared this morning and started working without a single word . which is the most professional behavior for anyone beginning a new job . well , he seems hard at work , even if every time i address him he does not notice me . it ' s great having a competent replacement for kareem , even if i have no idea how this new inter got here and who he is . as long as the filing is getting done . alondra ortiz , daughter of josefina ortiz who passed away last month , has carried on her fight against the angels . the angels are claiming ownership of old woman josie ' s estate , since they lives with her and helped her build the many artistic monuments and cultural foundations around town . alondra said she does not care if angels are acknowledged or not . if they want to be recognized , fine , but alondra and her lawyer , emilie avare have filed motions to maintain ownership of alondra ' s mother ' s home , belongings , money , and memories . just because a bunch of imaginary tall people with wings helped josie change the lightbulbs from time to time , avare said , that ' s no reason they are considered next of kin . avare told judge siobhan adam : ` ` if they do not exist , we must get kissed . '' judge adam replied : ` ` emilie , it ' s been four years . i ' m re married . we ' re done , ok ? '' the angels have hired five-headed dragon miriam adelman as their counsel , who issued a literally scathing response . alondra is now suing adelman and her team for medical bills resulting from second degree burns . alondra has already put josie ' s home up for sale . she is willing to offer rebates for pre-existing damage , such as a series of large glowing slits in the walls that lead to rooms that are not ... possible , according to the official floor plan , nor the laws of physics . these rooms range from a 17 th century ball room to a crow ' s nest on a modern navy destroyed to the space scuttle . plus , anachronistic people keep wandering in and out of these portals . she added , ` ` on second thought , since the house has more us able square foot age than originally anticipated , and because there appear to be current renters '' , she ' s raising the sale price . so i just sent my new inter to go pick up some lunch . or at least i said , ` ` excuse me young man whose name i do not know yet who i only think works here , can you go grab me a cobb salad with extra whipped cream and pencil shavings from the missing frog salad bar ? he did not say yes , nor did he ever seem to see or hear me , but he did look really frightened and ran from the room crying , which was such a polite and respectful gesture to his superior . what a nice young man . dresses kind of weird though , so early 80 ' s , with his double windsor striped tie , polyester coat and aviator goggles , just like we all wore back in the day . i supposed most things eventually come back in fashion . well , i can only assume he heard my lunch order . i ' m starving . careless old woman : you ' re starving ? try not having a mouth . cecil : oh my god , you scared me . listeners , we have an un planned visit from the careless old woman who secretly lives in your home . or i guess in this case , your radio studio while you ' re still on the air . fo w : cecil , we need to talk about the distant prince . cecil : few dare to speak at him , so as not to draw his attention . what do you know ? fo w : his harbingers are here . they are prepared to announce his arrival with their long , tooth beaks . they ' re stomach-eyes see all . they ' ve been rehearsing this announcement in their room at the hampton inn on route 800. they ' ve been writing and re writing their grand pronouncement and teaching it to the court shriekers to shriek out to all of night vale . cecil : what does that mean ? fo w : what , ` ` shriek '' ? it ' s like a painful yell . like this : meanwhile , the mangled servants are gathering the ears of important night vale politicians . cecil : gross . fo w : right ? and they will sew the ears onto the walls of the hampton inn continental breakfast bar and use them as portals into many dimensions at once . their plan is to destroy time itself and collapse night vale into a dead singularity . cecil : why do they want to do this ? fo w : it was suggested to him by a nice young woman from out of town . cecil : what young woman ? fo w : she she the woman from italy brings fun and jest , consuming all souls until none are left . distant prince and she plan the terrible plot : destroying all that is until all is not . i met her in dreams and found a dear friend , a woman a mortal mind ca not comprehend . no guard controls her , no physics can hold her , she ' ll set the world on fire but leave you all colder . yeah , she and i are best friends now . she ' s a lot of fun , really good poet . i got ta go . steve carlsberg is back home , and i wan na stand behind him in the mirror when he bends down to wash his face . his shrieks are the funniest . cecil : oh ah a havana , dumb old steve ! be nice , ok ? we are getting reports that a dense fog is now pouring from a giant glowing slash in the sky above the rec center . some pteranodons have flown out of it , as well as a commercial airline . and those who entered the fog reported hearing shouts , blood-curdling streams , and even the echo of drums . but there ' s also the battle of the bands sound check happening right now at the rec center , so it ' s probably just that . either way , keep a close eye out for these apparent tears in the fabric of our reality . also , go check out the battle of the bands . i think diane clayton ' s son josh and his boyfriend grant are organizing that event . and now a word from our sponsors . today ' s show is brought to by a grey pigeon , whispering to you from your neighbor ' s backward . the pigeon – his name is allons – is telling you that you are the one true god . and that he wants you to bring it a body part . a human body part . does not matter which part . just do it . soon . ` ` time ' s almost gone . the bible was wrong , '' the pigeon added , suddenly from your right shoulder . ` ` there never was a beginning . '' this has been a word from our sponsors . reports continue from the last few weeks of people all over night vale experiencing false realities . the most believable visions are those of tall winged beings roaming the streets and asking to borrow 10 bucks . city council is issuing daily press re leases , claiming the existence of angels is impossible and illegal . city council is threatening to no longer speak to anyone who acknowledges the so-called angels . ` ` you are uninvited to our birthday party , '' today ' s press release reads . ` ` too bad , there will be karaoke and minigolf . your loss , angel acknowledger ! '' a series of fissures in reality have begun to open up , revealing truths that should never have existed . like the 12 th century scottish castle sitting at op the stables over on galloway . frances donelson at the antique mall reports suddenly knowing how to play the piano , when before she only knew how to play keyboard . larry le roy out on the edge of town came home to find his wife , chrysette , mowing the lawn . but he was never married . he last saw chrysette in high school , when they were both in the lurching band together . and fired chief among encarnacion said she found a rock in the shape of harry sty les ' liver . ` ` i do not know how harry is getting by without his liver , '' incarnassian said . ` ` or given how much mud was on this thing , how he was ever getting by with it . '' night vale , beware the untruth which attempt to dismantled our town . stay vigilant , read your journals , look at your photographs . do your best to remember what is real . oh man , speaking of real , i ' m real hungry . i wish my inter would get back soon with my salad . it ' s been forever since he ... oh , wait . he left his wallet behind . well , strike one , new inter . how are you supposed to buy lunch if you do not take any money ? hope he has some cash in his pockets . i ' ll be so annoyed if lunch is late . ah , this is a pretty nice wallet . trifold , ooh photo pages , human leather , money clip . i used to have one just like this . maybe let ' s find out more about you , kid do . let ' s see . bowl ing league card . ooh , i love bowl ing . young reporter ' s league membership . wo w , it ' s after my own heart . photo of him with a young man he could probably be related to and , is that my ... who are you ? where ' s your driver ' s license ? oh god . this can't.. this ca not be . this here ... just ... uh , ok , here ' s the weather while i sort this out . my new inter never made it back . he never left , or maybe , was never hear at all . or maybe still is here after all these years . after finding his ... my ... id in his wallet , i ran out after him . but before i even got out of the building , i found him in the restroom . the door was slightly cracked and the light was on . i heard a voice , a familiar young voice . ` ` leonard said if i work hard , maybe i ' ll be a radio presented myself some day , '' said the voice . i was so frightened but still i looked into the washroom , and he was standing in front of a mirror looking right at himself . i never look into those things , or at least i have not in a long time . ` ` i think the radio station is fun , '' he said . ` ` i think the radio station is hidden . i think the radio station is like a dark planet lit by no sun . i think , therefore i soon wo not be , '' he said . i wanted to cry out to warn him . my mother told me to stay away from mirrors , and i knew he was in danger . i opened my mouth and tried to step in the room , but i could not speak , could not move forward . ` ` i ' m looking in the mirror , '' he said . ` ` the mirror is not covered , '' he said . ` ` stop ! do not look into the mirror ! '' i tried to say , but nothing came out of my mind , only spit and inaudible where . tears stung my eyes . i waved frantically , trying to catch his attention . ` ` the flickering movement is just behind me , '' he said , and then he looked right at me in the mirror . his eyes grew wide and wet . he said , ` ` i ... '' he said again , ` ` i ... '' and then he choked . then he screamed , then i screamed , only again no sound came out . he fell to the floor , and for a moment , i remembered . i remembered blue lights and blood in my throat , and the dark planet lit by no sun and then i forgot it . or at least what it looked like or , only that it was , or never was or it still is . his wallet was no longer in my studio , his ... my ... driver ' s license was no longer in my hand , my familiar teenage inter was no longer lying on the ground . the mirror he was looking into is now shattered into thousands of intersecting cracks like parched desert dirt . i approached the mirror , hoping to see a face i knew : a young man ' s face i just barely remember . but i only saw a multiplicity of me , a man divided , unrecognizable under razor-sharp grounds , and behind me a glowing slash in the bathroom wall . when i turned , the whole in reality was gone . only plain gray subways ti les . i do not know what is real . myself as a younger inter , the woman from italy , these holes in reality . harry stiles ' liver . harry stiles . are any of these things real ? one thing i know is real were the angels . after hours of waiting in line , their paperwork has been officially filed , with the hall of public records , and a hearing date schedule sometime between the last friday of this month , and the last friday of 2023. night vale . reality is failing us . and strange forces are gathering . the distant prince , the woman from italy . the dragons . huntokar . i do not know what we can do to save a failing reality , i only know , uh ... we can make real that which we acknowledge and accept . angels are real , night vale . the actually of people we rarely see or interact with may seem unimportant as fissures in our world , threatening to collapse anything we know but – if you see an angel , tell them you see them . tell them they are real . point at them and shout : ` ` you ' re . an . angel ! '' we can only make real what we accept as real , . tell them , ok ? good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : good things come to those who wait . good things come glittering down the unctuous brown stone walls to those who wait alone in the dark pit .
WTNV|The Missing Sky|1 May 2017|the best strategy for a labyrinth is to put one hand on a wall and follow that hand until you reach the exit . the second best strategy is screaming . welcome to night vale . we start with our lead story : the faint popping that people have been hearing under the earth . it sounds like the mole people are making pop corn in huge numbers , but everyone knows that mole people are deathly allergic to corn , so maybe something else ? city council issued the same statement it does for all emergencies , explaining that everything ' s fine , we should not be worried , and that if we are worried , it probably means we did something wrong and are guilty about it . ` ` just what did you do ? '' the statement asks hundreds of times and increasingly larger fonts . carlos is intrigued by the popping . he is taking a small task force of his top scientists , lucia and nilanjana , to investigate . he placed censors in a number of locations and is trying to track the epi center of the sound . meanwhile , reports of strange aberrations in reality continue , with large gash es appearing in the sky and on walls all over town . plus , nearly daily reports of false or alternative memories , which city council again would like to remind you is almost probably fine . ` ` see , we even put out a press release that everything ' s fine , so it ' s true ! '' they said . more soon , but first a word from our sponsors . today ' s show is brought to by ace hardware on fifth and s hay street . which is a real hardware store , and not merely a camouflaged snake pit . ace hardware is here to fit all of your needs , and while it may look like a crude representation of a store created out of leaves and trash by hundreds of animals that had to work without the benefit of limbs . trust us that we are a real store , that you can really enter , and will definitely leave again , alive and un eaten . do not worry , the near deafening hiss is the sound of hardware savings on everything including circular saws , reciprocating saws , cop ing saws , and of course hand saws . all kinds of saws are 50 per cent off during this week ' s ` ` you saw it , you bought it '' s < ale . come by today . we also copy keys if you need that , so again , come on buy . this has been a word from our sponsors . city council is still in conflict about the situation at old woman josie ' s house . old woman josie passed away several years ago , and we all remember her fondly . i myself never got to know her well , but those close to me say that she was a generous , kind , and incredibly clever human being , and the world is poorer without her . but it has been poorer without her for a while , and city council indicates it is time to move forward with the plan the demolition of her house for the new highway extension . the lone voice of protest to this plan is erika , who has been living in old woman josie ' s house a few years before josie ' s death . erika has no relation to josie , but says that josie took her in decades ago . no one knows much about erika . she is a middle-aged woman with short hair and a tattoo of an angel on her right forearm . she was visiting town when contact was cut off with the outside world , and of course now , she can not leave . she argues that , given that she has no way to return to the family she left behind , it would be cruel to force her out of the home she has made for herself . we will monitor this situation as it continues . citizens , we enter the great weeks of memorial , in which we remember the vicious and inexplicable attack that almost destroyed our city , and the fruitless years of war that followed . this will be observed in the usual manner with parades and military displays . mayor pamela mitchell will give a speech honoring those killed in battle , including intelligence officer leann hart , and john peters , you know , the war hero . i would like to take this moment to thank a fallen warrior from my own family . he was a great man . i speak of course of my brother-in-law and best friend , steve carlsberg . ever since the great change , which cut us off from the rest of the world , he devoted himself to understanding what had happened to us . he had never been interested in the strange or abnormal before , but threw himself into research and observation . he said that , contemplation the new sky above us , he could see lines and intersections , a great grid pattern across the heavens . when the attack came , he was one of the first to enlist . we all tried to stop him . steve was not naturally a fighter , but he said that he had to protect his wife abby and his daughter janice . and he joined those brave few who left our boundaries to explore ... whatever is out there . and he never came home . steve , i love you . you know , sometimes i go out at night and try to see the same lines you did , the great grid pattern in the sky . but it ' s hard to see through those tears , you know ? mayor mitchell is preparing to speak now . she is standing in front of the brand new memorial statue , with the controversial design chosen by harriet ram one and benjamin gould of the city council . the design that depict a human foot , several stories tall . let ' s go to her speech . pamela mitchell : people of night vale . i come to you as i do every year , as a mere citizens . as another human being who lives in this town . who has suffered losses of her own , who has fears of her own . we are none of us alone , except when we think we are . we have all faced circumstances that can only be categories as extraordinary . and that we are still here , that we come together today to remember , this is a sign that we , too , are extraordinary . citizens , we will persist , no matter what . no matter how , no matter the the weight in our hearts , we will continue i like the tail and i like the flank , and i like the part where the fur goes up when they get excited , and i like the ears . and the tongue . and the face . and those are the parts of the dog that i enjoy . i wish there was a dog to pet right now . the question might be : would i give up on a regular life in order to pet a dog at all times forever ? and the answer is yes of course instantly , without regret . thank you . i will not be taking any other questions . this has been my emergency press conference on the subject of the strange noise detected from below the earth . i will now put myself into a canvas bag that will be chained shut and then will be , an instant later , revealed to be empty . cecil : wise words from our director of emergency press conferences , pamela mitchell . carlos is continuing his investigation into the subterranean popping . there are now also sounds that resemble singing , but not at a frequency that matches any possible human voice . he is trying to examine what alterations could make a human sound like that . one hypothesis is that it could be caused by severe mutations from genetic manipulation or exposure to massive radiation . he also has a chalk board full of numbers . these are his favorite numbers , and whenever he feels overwhelmed , he can look at the chalk board and feel like – he has more control over his situation . in any case , as the city council says it ' s probably fine , do not worry about it ! do not worry about it . and now , traffic . for that , we take you to ten uninterrupted minutes of farm sounds . things are looking pretty clear out on the roads , like most days . listeners , why do i keep reporting the traffic ? i do not know . i ' ve asked myself the same question . muscle memory i guess ? habit ? the reason we squint when leaving our homes , as though the sun might be there this time , but we all know the sun wo not be there . nothing is in the sky anymore . and we do not have gasoline . not since the truck s stopped coming . no more de liveries . out on route 800 , trish hide is taking a walk under the constant rolling thunder we ' ve learned to live with . she likes to walk sometimes , in what she imagines must be the evenings , although others in town have taken those times to be the morning , and others still are asleep in the middle of their nights . she takes walks out to where the road ends and the great slopes rise up . she stands there at the edge of town , which is now the edge of everything , and she cries . yeah , she really lets it out . no one hears her . she just puts her hands just beyond the end of the highway and holds them there for a moment , and then she turns and makes the looking walk home . to a husband who is asleep , because she and her husband have agreed to live by different clocks , for reasons that are their own . so that is the one bit of traffic in town i guess . if you see trish , give her a hug . ask first . you should always ask first before giving anyone a hug . as the parade lines form , as we prepare to march out and remember the vicious attack against us , i am drawn , as i am every year , to my own memory of what happened that terrible day . we were starting to feel that we had reached a kind of acceptance of the great change years ago that took our sky and our connection to the rest of the world from us . and those years later , we were going about our business under that blank sky . eating at the moonlite all-nite din er , studying at the public library . helping john and jim peters in the fields so that our isolated community could continue to have food . we heard the usual loud rumblings , like a rock slide above us . but then , there it was : a tower of destruction . an aberration . a terrible apparition . an abomination in our absent sky . and nothing would ever be the same . and afterwards , the years of war , only recently given up as lost . what did we do to deserve all that is happened to us ? first , the theft of our sky . then , years later , the attack . listeners , do you ever think about the moon ? i was sitting outside last night and i thought , does anyone actually know where that thing went ? have there been any studies on this ? i d ask a scientist , but i ' ve never met one in person . i ' ve only heard of the famous scientists like rosalind franklin and lisa meitner , and hidetaka miyazaki . i doubt a scientist would ever deign to come to such a small and isolate town as ours , especially now that it ' s ... so much more difficult to get here . but the moon ' s disappearance was weird , right ? it was there and there and then suddenly it was not . all the stars went too , replaced by a smooth blank . where . did . the moon . go ? is it somewhere hidden , watching us ? if not , what is it watching instead ? is there something more interesting than us ? hey , watch us , moon ! we may not always be the best show in the universe , but we try . this has been today ' s children ' s fun fact science corner . and now the weather . clear skies tonight , although cloudy and windy tomorrow , with guests up to 45 carlos and his team have found the source of the subterranean popping noise , but it is not a place we expected any more disturbance from , and it is not a place that – i ' m comfortable with him going . they advanced on the area , nodding to each other to confirm that their suspicion was correct , and making hand signals to indicate that they should have worked out some hand signals before starting . listeners , i am , i ' m just , i ' m sick with apprehension . carlos.. just please be careful ! ok , he ' s approaching the source . ah em . the singing is louder than ever , strange and high-pitched . there are popping noise and a pulling vibration , he reaches cautiously out of the edge and he looks and yes , yes , it is as we feared , it is the tiny city under lane 5 of the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex . the tiny streets are team ing with tiny parades . there are the loud pop s of tiny fireworks and the singing , which carlos now confirms matches the unified sound of hundreds of tiny human voices . the last time carlos approached the city , he entered it and was attacked and almost killed by the residents . this led to years of war with the tiny people , which was mostly quite manageable because they are exceptionally small , but still , caution . is . warranted . ok , hold on , i ' m go n na uh , head over there to give him moral support , so let ' s return to the farm sounds previously in progress . an aberration , a terrible apparition . an abomination in our absent sky . as we marched our memorial march and held aloft our portable shrines to our god , and set off our many fireworks , there appeared above us enormous face of the entity that tried to destroy our city , not four years ago . why this great being from beyond chose to return at this moment , i ' m not sure but it leaves me unneeassyy , listeners . it leaves the feeling that history is bubbling back up . that perhaps another great shift is coming . like that shift many years ago , when hunter destroyed – oh great god huntokar – appeared to us and took our sky away . we ' ve prayed every year to huntokar , but she has never returned the world that we once lived in . surely we will fade away , unable to get what we need from the outside world . why did huntokar do this to us ? we may never know . and then this creature attacking us from the world above , with the giant foot so controversial depicted in the new memorial statue . looking into his rich , brown eyes today ... he was beautiful . much like us humans , but of course larger , with teeth like ... a military cemetery , and absolutely perfect hair . no lowly mortal could ever achieve hair that perfect . the last attack from this being led to a disastrous war with these giants , one that nearly ruined our city . i hope that these powerful beings look away from us , leave us forgotten and dying , leave us cut off from the world . unless huntokar un does what she once did to us . unless we finally are absolved of whatever crimes we are being punished for . unless , at last , the sky is returned these many decades later . but until then , we will continue our great weeks of memorial , and then this fall , enter into the months of the remembrance of the change . stay tuned next for one of our most popular shows , panelled quarte ' s advice show , ` ` hey panelled , what did i personally do to contribute to huntokar ' s anger against us ?

WTNV|Cooking Stuff: Thanksgiving Special|15 November 2015|you can purchase ghost stories here . transcribe of the main tracks here . 16. carlos the final of my ghost story coming up . but first . a lot of people do not believe in ghosts , which is kin da weird , because we have an entire city full of them one town over in pine cliffs . but people just refuse to believe that there could be any presence of a spirit after a person dies . and i figured that there is only one way to really investigate the truth of the paranormal . and that is to ask a scientist . so i invited my boyfriend carlos to the radio station . hi , carlos ! carlos : hey , cecil ! cecil : so carlos , what scientific evidence , if any , supports the existence of ghosts ? carlos : oh there is lots of valid research done on ghosts , like that famous story where ben franklin tied a kite to a gravest one , you know ? ghosts are 100 % scientific ally real . in fact , i have a story about a project i worked on that proved that ghosts were real . cecil : ooh . carlos : so , i was working late one night , and it was exactly midnight , ok ? and there was a full moon , and i was alone in my laboratory . so context : right next door lab is a graveyard filled with former scientists who all failed to have orsha standard eye wash stations . it ' s very scar y , ok ? so some of , like , the great minds of our field are buried there . marie cure , george washington car ver , david blaine , ok ? but david blaine , he comes in and he comes out , right , you got that . but so ... back to the story , so i was pouring green bubbling liquid from one flask into a beak er full of orange steaming liquid , when i heard a noise , ok ? footsteps . i thought it was mitchell , one of my assistants , who lives in the crawl space above the lab . the footsteps were coming closer . i could hear the wind howling outside and i could see an owl on an angular branch just outside the window , it was staring back at me but ... just a normal government surveillance owl ! and then the room , it grew so cold that i began to shiver . and the footsteps stopped suddenly , their sound coming from just behind me and i could not look ! cecil : because you were frozen in fear ! carlos : no , ok so like i said , i was pretty sure that it was just mitchell coming down the stairs cecil : oh , ok.. carlos : yeah so yeah , just stay with the story . so you know , thought he was getting a snack and then i was trying to finish my experiment by logging the results of what happened when i mixed the two liquid . um ah em ( quote ) , ` ` the new mixture turned brownish '' , i wrote in my science journal , satisfied at my productivity . but after that , i turned around to see that it was not mitchell at all , it was an apparition , a hay silvery form of a person and his hair was curly and wit e , and he wore an 18 th century cravat and long coat with like really ornate buttons like little for de lis , you know , carved out it was so delightful . and anyway , he covered a few inches off the ground and before i could say anything , the ghost opened its contorted wrinkled ma w like this ! cecil : so this is the radio , carlos . carlos : then , st il making that ghastly face , he groaned . yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrr ... cecil : oh . carlos : anyway , he reached out his cloudy hand toward me , still moaning , and the wind outside roared , and i could hear the owl flapping quickly away . and he stepped forward and i heard the booming clop of his buckled shoe on the hardihood floor , and i jumped back and i shouted ... cecil : whoa carlos , this is too scar y . carlos : no , how interesting ! cecil : wait , what ? carlos : that is what i shouted , i said ` ` how interesting ! '' this ghost with no real tangible form still made noise when he walked . cecil : oh . carlos : and i asked the ghost , ` ` how are you making that noise , '' and he continued toward me still groaning . right , ok . still groaning and i backed away from him making notes the whole time ! i had to circle backwards around the lab several times as he continued following me and i asked him more questions like , ` ` so how did you die '' and ` ` where did you get those stunning thighs , your calves look fantastic ? '' but he did not answer . he simply maintained his slow pursuit . i ended up writing down some calculations and observations , but it was getting late so i backed on out of the lab . the ghost did not seem to want me to go . he wailed as i stepped out of the front and he made an even more horrible facial expression than before . like this . cecil : radio . carlos : and while he made that facial expression , he made one final terrible sound , ok ? like this : eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.. i felt bad , so i told him , ` ` i ' ll be back wednesday night , i want to learn more about you physically '' cecil : what ? carlos : and then i said – oh god , no no no no . i said no no , that came out weird like i want to study your body and then i said aah , wait wait i just mean i wan na experiment with you , you know ? agh , nevermind , i ' ll see you wednesday ! cecil : ohhh . that was a narrowing encounter ! carlos : yeah . cecil : so did you learn how the ghost makes sounds when he walks ? carlos : oh you know what , so it turns out he does not . cecil : no . carlos . yeah . that was mitchell just walking around the the kitchen , making a little snack . just co incidentally exactly timed with the ghost . also , really cool , i learned that the ghost was actually the ghost of mitchell ' s like great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather , visiting from early colonial canada . cecil : whoa ! i ' ve actually never heard of canada . where is that ? carlos : i ' m a scientist cecil , not a map maker ! it ' s in boston . cecil : oh , ok . whoa ! thank you for sharing your story , carlos . carlos : sure . you know i love it when science and radio overlap . cecil : i do too . love you ! carlos : love you too . cecil : thank you , carlos . 17. dana cardinal so . because the ghost stories competition is such an important event in our town , night vale ' s mayor , dana cardinal , has sent herself , dana cardinal . and she is here at the station to deliver her own press conference , so please welcome mayor dana cardinal ! hello there , mayor cardinal ! dana : hello to you , cecil . cecil : now you sent pamela earlier to speak on your behalf . dana : and let me guess , she just told you this story about that rock she ate ? cecil : well ll ... dana : there were not even any ghosts in her story , were there ? cecil : aaaah not explicitly , but her argument was that she we - dana : cecil ! today it is i who speaks for myself . not pamela . not hollow-eyed messenger children , or the city council , or community radio , or that power all city officials have to completely take over anyone ' s personality and body and use them to spread propaganda . cecil : wait what , you can do that ? dana : today i am going to speak for myself . i want to tell a ghost story . it sounds like fun , and frankly being mayor of night vale is a lonely and tedious position . i could use some fun . cecil : well great , let ' s hear it ! dana : this is a true story . or as true as any story is , which is to say that it ' s entirely made up . and it is about my great uncle herbert . now my great uncle herbert owned the old mansion on the hill . you know , the one with walls continuing upright bricks meeting neatly doors sensibly shut , silence laying steadily against the wood and stone , and whatever walks there walks alone ? cecil : oh sure , yeah . i saw that real estate listing . dana : right . well , old herbert died a few years back . his passing was sad , but not unexpected . our family had long seen it coming because the day , time , and detailed description of the exact farm equipment he would be found scattered beneath were written in detail at his birth by the doctor on the birth certificate under ` ` expiration date '' . also , he had cut off all contact many years earlier with his family , relying only on his silent lowering manservant , sherfwood , to see to his affairs . which is how it came to be that sherfwood was at the door of my family ' s house one morning with a message from my late great uncle . whosoever could spend the night on the old mansion on the hill would inherit it , along with the rest of herbert ' s property . cecil : whoa . dana : mm hm , yeah . you know , you d think a weird like that would have done something strange , like make everyone in my family uncomfortable by naming one specific person the owner and leaving the rest of us feeling left out . no , but instead he followed normal procedures for will settlement . so we all went to the old mansion on the hill and were shown to our rooms . we were nervous but excited , confident that sleeping inside a house could not be that hard . cecil : well , i do it almost every day . dana : mm hm . but none of us made it through the night . cecil : oh no ! dana , what happened ? dana : well it was the house . the house was full of truly hideous things , horrible things ! cecil : oh like monsters and ghosts ? dana : no . glass-topped tables ! cecil : dana : lacker-veneered dressers . cecil : ooh . dana : high-pile rugs . wallpaper . wallpaper , cecil ! cecil : no , www . just www ! dana : it was all so badly thought through . everything clashed with everything else , the design was a disaster ! all the cups in the kitchen were covered in a parish star design . we tried to ignore it , to grit our teeth and wait for dawn , hoping to find just a hint of danish modern or even something made of driftwood . but even my cousin dense , who ' s a ghost , could not stand it . she said that she did not want to wa ft transparently through any of those ecru walls . cecil : ok , now i am going to be sick . dana : plus , what ghost wants to drift through walls anymore ? had herbert never heard of an open concept floor plan ? i mean , it provides more room for ghostly activities , like dragging chains and wailing ! in the end , the only one willing to stay was sherfwood , who had been in charge of designing the place , and so was the only one able to withstand the outdated décor . cecil : ugh . well , i do not know if i would call that a ghost story , but at least it did have one ghost in it . dana : do not you see , cecil ? in this story , the house itself is the ghost . cecil : really ? dana : no , that was a joke . cecil : ah ! oh hata , ahahaa-hahaa , i totally get it now , that ' s hilarious ! dana : you know cecil , i love civic events like this . serving your town , giving it every hour of your working day , can paradoxical make you distant from your town and from the people in it . you no longer are among them but over them . the dynamic shifts . i miss hanging out with you . cecil : yeah , i miss hanging out with you too , dana . dana : well then let ' s hang out sometime . how about anywhere but the old mansion on the hill ? cecil : that sounds great . dana : ok . cecil : thank you so much , dana ! 18. earl harlan so this thursday afternoon , night vale ' s hottest restaurant , tourniquet , will be ho sting a chefs master class , taught by executive chief leshawn mason and sous-chef earl harlan . now , earl has agreed to come up to the studio and talk about this educational urinary event . so please welcome earl harlan ! earl : hi cecil ! i am so excited to promote this class . cecil : oh i can tell ! i mean , you have your index fingers pulling back the corners of your mouth to expose your teeth . earl : yeah , people say my smile really gives me away . cecil : mm hm m . earl : now , with so many popular cooking shows like top chef , the great british baking show , chopped , america ' s next top self-surgeon and who ' s in the slow cook er ? ... urinary classes are in high demand . chef mason and i will be teaching amateur chefs some important cooking technique . things like knife skill , knowing skill , descaling a fish , chicken manipulation , using industrial strength ly e to dissolve a corpse , how to pe el an orange , and what that strange humming closet at the end of the counter is for . cecil : oh yeah ! carlos and i have one of those humming closets , and when i open it up , there ' s a light inside and cool air wash es over me and i ' m just like – what is this thing ? earl : well , that ' s just your refrigerator , cecil . cecil : wait , that ' s a refrigerator ? ! earl : what have you been using as a fridge ? cecil : so tell us more about this master class um , earl . earl : well , cecil , since this is the ghost story competition day , i had a ghost story i wanted to share with you , one i heard back when you and i were in the boy scouts . so i need to set the spooky campfire mood a little bit , so just hang on . cecil : ok . um oh listeners , earl is now stacking some wood on the floor , oh a and he is pouring gasoline over it ... ? earl : oh hata no no no no , no i would not pour gasoline on your studio floor , cecil ! this is just a fancy bourbon that ' s sold in five-gallon gasoline canister . cecil : and listeners , he is now lighting a fire , um , there is a large fire in the studio , listeners ! earl : no no , like i said it ' s just bourbon ! right , here ' s a stick with a marshmallow on it . cecil : oh , thank you . earl : here ' s another one with a hot dog ... cecil : thank you . earl : and here ' s another one with a live rabbit . cecil : oooh ! cut e and delicious ! earl : so the story goes , as our old scout leader r on veal used to tell it . one summer , a troupe of scouts went camping . they did not know how to use a compass yet , so they followed the north star . but it turns out that what they thought was the north star was just a fire fly , and they were soon lost . it was getting dark . they were alone and afraid . it had been over an hour , so they had to rely on their special survival training . so they drew straw , and the scout who drew the short straw was eaten by the others . cecil : uh , i never actually completed that activity , so i never got my survival ist badge . earl : aww . i did . cecil : oh , cool . earl : so . by early that evening , the boys had painted their faces , removed their scout uniforms , donned animal pelts , and developed their own language , government , and currency . they sharpened sticks and invented war ch ants . then , just as the sun went down , they heard a voice close by . the voice called , ` ` dinnertime , boys ! '' it was one of the boys ' mothers , calling from the porch of the back yard they were camping in . but they had been away from civilization for so many hours , they did not understand english anymore . her voice was gibberish . they silenced their ch ants and paused building the bonfire , and the voice called again . ` ` enough housing around , kid s ! come inside ! '' now they understood her welcoming gesture , so they went inside and they had dinner . the voice called out again , this time from across the dining room table . ` ` where ' s ritchie ? '' but they said nothing . they only ate the food ravenous with their bare hands . ` ` do you boys know where ritchie went ? '' the voice called again , the boys ' eyes darting guilty to one another . ` ` richieee ! '' came the voice one final time , but the scouts only shifted in their chairs , pretending not to understand her refined , civilized rhetoric . to this day , it is said that if you stand in a backward at dusk , you can hear the sound of wind rustling through trees , and birds chirping , and you can watch the bright dot in the sky turn orange and sink into the horizon . cecil : so that must be the ghost of ritchie , right ? earl : no , that ' s just the wind and the birds and a sunset . cecil : oh ? earl : but ritchie ' s ghost did rejoin the troupe later that night , and they all played board games . cecil : ooh . earl : he got his apparition badge , and all of the other boys eventually got theirs , too ! cecil : oh wo w ! gosh , it just feels like centuries since we were boy scouts together ! earl : yeah that ' s because it has been , cecil . how have we lived so long ? and forgotten so much ? cecil : these last lines are in the next track for some reason . cecil : well , thank you so much coming on earl . earl : you bet . 19. inter geoffrey cranor i ' ve asked my station inter , felix , to prepare a ghost story of his very own . you see , felix has been such a hard worker with a great attitude , and i wanted to reward him with some practical broadcast ing experience . so felix , come on over to the microphone , and tell night vale your story ! ... you ' re not felix . inter geoffrey cranor : no , felix could not ... make it . cecil : so who are you ? ijc : oh i ' m your new inter , i ' m geoffrey cranor . cecil : oh , inter . inter geoffrey , alright um , hey what happened to felix ? ijc : it ' s difficult to say . cecil : aww . because you do not know what happened ? ijc : no i know , it ' s just emotional difficult to say it out loud . you know the fridge in the break room ? cecil : yes . ijc : and you know how it makes that mechanical grinding noise whenever you open it , that rrrr ? cecil : oh , yeah yeah . ijc : well it stopped making that noise . but you know how blood pours of it now when you open it ? cecil : no ? ijc : oh oh oh , heh , well okay let me back up then . you know how near the break room there ' s that hole in the wall ? cecil : oh yeah , i ' ve been asking operations to fix that for weeks now . ijc : right and you know how that hole is like three feet wide and these weird noise and shouts can be heard from it ? and you know how felix was always talking to those voices ? cecil : oh yeah , like all the time ! ijc : right , like ( blablabla ) .. so you know how when you die , your soul drift through all of time mostly simultaneously , it ' s not really as a ghost although some people manifest as such , but most of us fill the void with our decimated consciousness , all of the pain of life melts away as we pass into the beyond , and the sweet relief is immediately replaced by the crushing pain of knowledge , of eternity and the fastness of a universe that has no fences and no borders , but in death we can see what lies beyond , and you know how it is awful and beautiful and inspiring and ultimately boring because of the whole forever thing , you know ? cecil : i mean , i ' ve never died . ijc : ok , cecil . anyway . you know the hunger , the hunger we feel during mortality ? you know , that invariable urge to fill our temporary bodies with comfort , sustenance , something to momentarily destruct us from the immense pain of it all , had had had ? felix had that hunger . he had that hunger , and he went to the fridge in the break room . because he remembered the potato salad he brought to work last december but did not finish . and the fridge made that noise , that krrrrrr ! felix went to open the door but that was , he had forgotten what the voice in the hole in the wall had just been telling him , and that was unfortunate because it turns out that that voice in the hole in the wall was him , it was felix ' s immortal soul across all of time attempting to warn felix that there was an active jet engine from an air bus 8320 inside the fridge door . which amy in sales left there yesterday after lunch . krrrrrrrrrrrshhhhhhhhhhup ! i mean . and felix was just ... um , hr made amy take the jet engine home but the – oh man , the in sides of that fridge is still covered in uh ... memories of felix . cecil : that ' s terrible ! well ... to the family of inter felix ... he was a really good inter . ijc : he was . cecil : and he will be missed . ijc : yeah , i guess . i mean , he ' s still in the wall over there , you can go talk to him through that hole right over there . cecil : oh , well that ' s good , well could you ask him to finish up his filing by the end of the day please ? ijc : you got it , boss ! cecil : alright . oh hey , geoffrey geoffrey geoffrey . you seem to know like a lot about the afterlife . are you – dead ? i mean i mean i mean are you – like a ghost ? ijc : oh it ' s um , difficult to say . cecil : oh , because you you do not wan na talk about it ? ijc : no it ' s just difficult because i ' m eating this peanuts butter stuffed pratzen . cecil : ok . ijc : cecil : oh . ijc : but no , i ' m not . cecil : alright , well welcome to the station ! ijc : thanks boss ! cecil : alright , thank you geoffrey ! 20. louie black cecil : it is time for one of our favorite segments : louie black ' s music moment ! louie black : no . cecil : no ?

lb : oh yeah , you know , it ' s that song they sing before every football game to remind us that no matter who wins , everyone involved will eventually perish . cecil : it ' s not really ringing a bell . lb : no no no , it ' s uh , ` ` you did not have to do that to him , uh he had nothing to do with any of this ...

'' ` ` oh , like a literal ghost in the machine ! '' i exclaimed . then , there was a long , long silence . i watched the cursor closely , but it just blinked in place . just when i thought i could not wait any longer , it moved again and began to write out a message . cecil : what did it say ? mp : it wrote , ` ` you have to type it out for me to know what you ' re saying . i ca not hear you speak . '' cecil : mm hm . mp : so i wrote back , and he told me he used to work in a computer factory , which is how he ended up inside this computer , and that his killer is an evil supergenius programme . cecil : whoa , whoa , but if the ghost was a computer program that the killer wrote , then the killer must have been the one sending the messages . oh my gosh this is so exciting , a cat and mouse chase between two brilliant programme , so you must have had to decipher clues from the program but then had to consider whether the killer was one step ahead of you , and how do you determine the truth , how do you know what ' s important and what ' s a red hearing , oh my gosh i live murder mysteries so much ! what happened next melony , what happened ? mp : oh , i for matted the drive . cecil : oh . mp : it was a new computer , and these box store manufacturers pre program so much bulky chunk on there . do i need a cloud-based calendar solution and a piebald game and the ghost victim of an evil programme ? no i do not . so i for matted and installed my own operating system . cecil : wo w , that was pretty easy then . mp : mm hm . i ' ve got a load of memory now for gazing though . hey , hey look , the birds are gathering ! oh i think something cool is about to go down . i should go . cecil : well bye melony . mp : bye , whoever you are . nice house . cecil : oh , thank you . thank you , melony . 22. michelle nguyen a quick update on next saturday ' s open mi c night at dark owl records . for more on that , let ' s talk with dark owl owner , michelle nguyen ! michelle , thanks for coming in . michelle nguyen : thanks , cecil . this is dark owl records ' first ever open mi c night . we are encouraging everyone in night vale who has a song to sing , a stand up comedy set , or a thing on their back they want a doctor to look at to come down to dark owl records . cecil : ok , so attended will sign up for a slot to get up on stage , sing their song , do their comedy , or get their back looked at . mn : oh , god no . i do not wan na hear any of that . an open mi c is not an invitation to just walk up it and start hammering like you ' re a real artist . www . no . cecil : oh . mn : an open mi c is a live microphone and an empty stage at the front of the room . attended will sit quietly and stare at it . cecil : but you said that people who have a song , a comedy set , or a diagnosis needed should come . mn : of course . i only want people who think of themselves as performer to come . but i want them to pay attention to the only real true performing art . silence and nothingness . if we were to just stop all of that for a moment and listen to that silence , we would understand what art is . a void . cecil : oh . that ' s actually quite beautiful . mn : oh no , it is . cecil : yeah . i mean this sounds like a lovely event and inviting and welcoming night for everyone to experience art together . so thank you for sharing your space with night vale . mn : on second thought , i d rather just hear people read their awful poems and struggle through another ( churches ) cover . everyone come on down to open mi c night next saturday and kill us all slowly with your desperate need for attention . cecil : ok ! oh , while you ' re here , do you have a ghost story you wan na share ?

was it fashion week 2008 ? cecil : go on with your story , michelle . mn : so when i played the tape later , it was not what i recorded at all . what i heard was not the chewing or the coyote howls . it was something much much worse . what i heard chilled me to my bones . cecil : what was it ? mn : it was a hiss , like a single unbroken breath . a gentle ... shhhhhhhh , for like 30 minutes on both sides of the tape . i wept from fright . i was terrified , i could not turn it off ! shhhhhhh.. it must be a curse , a haunted sound that once heard cause you to die exactly one year later . now that i think about it , that would be pretty exciting . no one in the music industry is doing anything like that anymore . i mean , madonna popularized audit death curses in the 80 ' s , but that was like 30 years ago , so it ' s like it never happened . cecil : ok michelle , that shah sound across both sides of the tape , i ' m pretty sure that the recording just failed , and you were listening to a blank cassette . so you ' re not go n na die in a year . mn : oh . cecil : are you ok ? mn : nothing fun ever happens to me . cecil : oh well , well that ' s not true ! i mean , you have a great record store , you have good friends , and you host fantastic events . you ' re an important part of our town , michelle ! mn : thanks cecil . that means a lot . i guess ! cecil : oh ok , well i ' ll see you soon . mn : do not tell anyone i accepted your compliment ! cecil : alright , i wo not , i wo not . thank you michelle ! she likes me . 23. sheriff sam # 1 oh but first , listeners , my red phone is ringing . and that means it ' s time to pick up the beige phone and hear which of the six other ringing phone i should be picking up , so let ' s see here . orange . oh , that means it ' s the sheriff , oh – standing right next to me in the studio ! sheriff sam : it is a simple system . cecil : oh , hello sheriff sam ! you know , you could always just knock and say hello . ss : but we already spent the money on this cod ed phone stuff . the taxpayers deserve to get what they paid for , even if it makes everyone ' s lives harder . that ' s democracy . or maybe it is not . i do not know or care what democracy is . cecil : so how has this day of ghost stories gone for you , sam ? ss : look , i want to tell a ghost story but uh , i ' ll be honest cecil.. cecil : please . ss : i ' m afraid . cecil : you ' re afraid of ghosts ? ss : of ghosts ? well of course . but also – pine trees . they ' re just so tall and pointy , you know ? and i ' m also afraid of the tiny scampering feet of mice i can hear in the ceiling running back and forth , and in addition , i ' m afraid that while i sleep an earthquake will happen , or a flood , or a sun spot . i ' m afraid of the night time because i ca not see anything and – i ' m afraid of the daytime because i can see everything . cecil : oh . ss : i ' m afraid of action and interaction . i ' m afraid of contradictions , i ' m afraid of food poisoning . but do you know what i ' m really afraid of ? san dun es , terrible things , like indecisive mountains . are you a hill or a heap ? make up your mind , sand du ne ! and i ' m afraid of being afraid . i ' m afraid that if i ' m afraid for too long , then that ' s all there will be to me . cecil : well , maybe it ' s time you faced your fears . ss : ooh ... no . i ' m quite afraid of faces . the only person i ' m not afraid of is the careless old woman who secretly lives in my home . or i would not be , except that i ' m also afraid of the elderly . cecil : now i got ta say this does not seem like you , i mean you ' re always so authoritative and shouty . ss : well what i seem like and what i am is not the same ! except i am very shouty . i mean not now obviously but then suddenly , at any moment i am shouting and i can not hear my fears ! cecil : aww , there ' s the sheriff i know . ss : but then i ' m not shouting and i ' m afraid again . cecil , one day i will look you right in the eye , and i will tell you a ghost story . i promise you that . cecil : well great ! ss : until then , cecil – uh oh , it appears your silver phone is ringing , and you know what that means . cecil : ugh , actually i do not . what does the silver phone mean ? oh now they ' re gone . now i ' m go n na be worried about this . 24. sheriff sam # 2 this is the same story told by dana above oh , listeners , it appears that sheriff sam has something to add to their previous statement as ... they are currently breaking down my door with a battering ram and have thrown several smoke canister into the room . sheriff , what is this emergency ? ss : cecil , i ' m ready . even though i ' m still afraid , i want to tell a ghost story of my own . it ' s my legal right , says so in the law . do not try to censor me . cecil : i wo not . you know , you could have just asked , i mean you do not need to break down the door . ss : oh no , the door broke itself . cecil : oh . ss : we were trying to stop it . anyway . this is a true story . or as true as any other story is , which is to say that it is entirely made up . and it ' s about my great uncle herbert . now , my great uncle herbert owned the old mansion on the hill . you know , the one with walls continuing upright , bricks meeting neatly , doors sensibly shut , silence laying steadily against the wood and stone , and whatever walks there walks alone ? cecil : yeah , sure . i saw that real estate listing . ss : right . well , old herbert died a few years back . his passing was sad , but not unexpected . our family had long seen it coming because the day , time , and detailed description of the exact farm equipment he would be found scattered beneath were written in detail at his birth by the doctor on the birth certificate under ` ` expiration date '' . also , he had cut off all contact many years earlier with his family , relying only on his silent lowering manservant , sherfwood , to see to his affairs . which is how it came to be that sherfwood was at the door of my family ' s house one morning with a message from my late great uncle . whosoever could spend the night on the old mansion on the hill would inherit it , along with the rest of herbert ' s property . cecil : oo , wo w . ss : yes . you know , you d think a weird like that would have done something strange , like make everyone in my family uncomfortable by naming one specific person the owner and leaving the rest of us feeling left out . but instead he followed normal procedures for a state settlement . we all went to the old mansion on the hill and were shown to our rooms . we were nervous but excited , confident that sleeping inside a house could not be that hard . cecil : i mean , i do it almost every day . ss : but none of us made it through the night . cecil : oh no ! sheriff , what happened ? ss : it was the house . the house was full of truly hideous things , horrible things ! cecil : monsters , ghosts ? ss : no . glass-topped tables ! cecil : ss : lacker-veneered dressers . cecil : oh h . ss : high-pile rugs . wallpaper . wallpaper , cecil ! cecil : oh god ! ss : it was all so badly thought through . everything clashed with everything else , the design was a disaster ! all the cups in the kitchen were covered in a parish star design . we tried to ignore it , to grit our teeth and wait for dawn , hoping to find just a hint of danish modern or something made of driftwood . but even my cousin dense , who ' s a ghost , could not stand it . she said she did not want to wa ft transparently through any of those ecru walls . cecil : oh god , ecru ? i ' m go n na be sick ! ss : in the end , the only one willing to stay was sherfwood , who had been in charge of designing the place , and so was the only one able to withstand the outdated décor . cecil : ugh . well , i do not know if i would call that a ghost story , but at least it did have a ghost in it . ss : but i told it , did not i ? i ' m proud of myself . thank you . but uh , but i am sorry about your door , heh . i ' m sorry about a lot of things . i find that sca ring someone else does help alleviate my own fears , so i had to break down your door , i ' m sorry . cecil : that ' s ok , sheriff . you know , a true apology is changing how you act in the future . ss : mmm that sounds difficult . i-i ' m not sorry enough for that . i said some words and that should make up for anything i ' ve ever done or ever will do . until next time , cecil ! cecil : alright , until next time she - oh , and ... and they broke my window on their way out .
WTNV|Cal|15 May 2017|there ' s a billboard along the highway that reads : ` ` everything . must . go . '' welcome to night vale . i do not talk much about my brother on this show . cal . he visited the other day from his home out near eagle farm , up in the mountains . he looked gaunt and pale . when i opened the door , he was bracing himself against the porch beam with one arm and coughing . cal was holding a suitcase . it was old-fashioned , leather , the kind without wheels or an extendable handle . he drove to my house in a 1980 mercury monarch , brick red , four doors . the front left bump er was caved in and the headlight , which looked to have been tap ed into place , had loosened again and fallen forward . i asked cal what had happened to his car . he did not know what i was talking about . i asked about the bump er and headlight , and he said , ` ` that ' s just how they make them , cecil . '' them he teased me for not understanding cars and walked into my home before i could invite him in . ` ` have you ever opened a box , only to find another box inside that box , and then you open that box and there was another box within it , and then you kept opening boxes hoping to find the last box . but the boxes became so small , your comparatively large fingers could no longer open them . until the box was so tiny , you could not see the box at all . '' i ' m not sure what that means . it ' s neither here nor there . which is to say it ' s nowhere . aquí , ah , too el mundo , no hay na da . i do not know spanish . yesterday afternoon , hadassah mcdaniels and the other five-headed dragons , outraged at the partial execution of hadassah ' s brother hiram last fall , moved into city hall . they displaced mayor cardinal and her staff , who then called upon the sheriff ' s secret police , and the rarely seen double secret police – a police so secret that even their members do not know that they are members . both the secret and the very surprised double secret police , just that morning informed of their jobs , showed up at city hall and tried reasoning with the dragons . the dragons ignored the weak efforts of the police and made straight for city council . the council climbed up on the roof of city hall , their many sharp appendages swinging down from their single giant body , punch ing out windows and grabbing whatever long dragon necks they could reach . and the city council ' s newest member , 16-year-old tamika lynn , the only member not connected to their primary form , rode on the rest of the council ' s back with a long bow . the dragons breathed fire upward at the city council , who shrieked in pain , or possibly delight . the battle ended when city council was knocked off the roof by five-headed dragon and private estate lawyer , dirk andrews . the council , minus tamika , retracted form the advancing dragons , called a ly ft and sped out of town , as they are wont to do in times of crisis . tamika paced at the edge of the city hall lawn , cursing and thwacking a well-worn copy of glen david gould ' s ` ` carter beats the devil '' into her callous palm . above the city hall , a long black slit was torn into the light blue sky , and no one reported seeing the moon . when cal entered my house , i offered him some tea , and then called carlos to come join us . but cal said he does not drink , and carlos did not respond to my calls . i told cal it was just tea , no alcohol , and he said he does not drink anything . i peaked into carlos ' office , but he was not there . nothing was there . it was just an empty room . carlos was not gone , he had never been there . and for a moment i did not miss him , as for a moment , i did not remember he existed . it was just an empty room , i thought casually . cal sat down his suitcase and said , ` ` you hear that cecil ? you hear that noise ? '' he pointed straight up . ` ` in the firmament , '' he said . ` ` do you hear it ? '' he repeated . i listened , and i heard . i heard paper being torn , i heard weeds being pulled , i heard – egg shells crumbling . when i looked back to say yes , he was holding his hand to his mouth and lurching forward over the sink . a trickle of blood ran down the outside of his hand . i could see his tongue moving rapidly along the in sides of his cheeks , as he let out small grunts . he finally removed his hand and spat sharply into the kitchen sink . i heard a loud rattling in the painless steel basin and saw two teeth , unbroken , root , bones and all , lying in the strain er . i stared at them and remarked at how long a human tooth actually is . cal wiped his face and hands . ` ` nice to finally get rid of those , '' he said as he tore off pieces of paper towel and wedged them into the holes in his gums . then he asked , ` ` you got a girlfriend or what , little brother ? '' in my life with cal , i d never told him i would never have a girlfriend . in night vale , no one cared either way , but i felt like cal would have . in this other reality , i was single . so i only said , ` ` no . '' he shrugged and scratched his head . as he did , a patch of dark hair fell to the floor . we watched it fall , lifting and loop ing slowly downward . which falls faster , a brick or a tuft of hair ? carlos taught me this physics riddle . it ' s a trick question . the brick falls faster , not because of its weight but because a brick falling is less horrify ing than the unexpected loss of even a minor part of your body . time does not slow down for that which is uninteresting . ` ` ha h , better not look in the mirror , '' cal said , as he nervously simulated the sound of laughter . a dribble of blood ran down his chin and onto his chest . when the public library disappeared last week , no one celebrated nor mourned its absence , as we could barely remember it being there . in its place , a long black sliver of nothing . a hole in our universe , near which no one wanted to go . except for carlos , who ' s a scientist and wants to t study everything , but i told him no way . the pteranodons which poured out of a similar hole inside the rec center last month have taken over the barista district , building giant nests from canvas bean sacks and flyers promoting local bands and burlesque shows . near the city hall , dozens of angels , more than i have ever seen at one time , are still surrounding the hall of public records , demanding expedition of their application to be officially recognized as living beings . the angels are waving hand-drawn signs with phrases like ` ` look at us '' . but their handwriting is so shaky as to make the typography quite distracting , so most bystanders did not notice the angels , but instead fixated on trying to read their signs . the angels are shouting , ` ` it only works if you believe it does ! '' but as this sentence has an erratic rhythm , it did not catch on with many passers-by , many of whom were busy screaming and running from vengeance-minded dragons . some even pointed into space and yelled , ` ` the distant prince ! '' he ' s less distant than ever before . cal told me stories of our youth . how , as kid s , we would speak out late at night and vandalia houses and cars for fun . little things like stealing hood ornaments or placing live scorpions in mailboxes or making creep ghost noise outside bedroom windows . he smiled as he regal ed what was for him , a funny story of boys being boys , but i did not like his story . i could remember it , but i also knew it was not real at all . in his story , i was prying loose the aluminium ram ' s head at the front of a 1975 dodge pick up with a flat head screwdriver . the truck was dark blue with ta n leather bench seats . i remembered it was park ed in front of a mid-century ranch style home with a rock garden full of succulents and hers . as cal spoke , i could smell rosary in the cool desert air . cal placed his hands on his belly , and his eyes rolled back in his head . ` ` you ok ? '' i asked . ` ` it ' s just the after effects man , '' cal shrugged . ` ` hey , you remember when mo m used to take us to the library to read , but we would look up dirty words in the dictionary instead ? '' ` ` mo m would have never put us in such danger , '' i protested . he stared at me for a moment , his head cocked sideways , an eyebrow raised . then he lurched forward out of his seat onto his hands and knees and vomited onto the rug . we both stared at the viscous red stain concerned . no , not concerned – embarrassed . let ' s have a look at the community calendar . this thursday afternoon , the careless old woman and the woman from italy will be at the night vale mall from noon to 4 pm , offering spoke tortures for anyone who walks by . the woman from italy will recite the unlucky passers-by future pain , in the form of a catch poem like : the woman from italy will leave you in stitches . not laughter , though she ' ll laugh . a sound which is full of diabolical torment and wicked behavior , as she flays you before your friends and your neighbors . you ' ll yet be alive when she opens your chest , the wet beat of your heart and the choke of your breath . she co os , ` ` do not fear ! it ' s as quick as can be . '' but in truth , there ' s years left to this misery . the careless old woman will simply write some harsh insults in silver charpie on the side of an egg plant and hur l it at your family . saturday afternoon , the night vale pta will be holding an emergency bake sale to raise money for the elementary school gym , recently burned down by hadassah mcdaniels . it ' s also a clearance sale to finally get rid of the store room full of baked goods that have gone un sold the past two years . monday , another hole will open in the sky , and then another . things will come , other things will go . i will remember that michigan is a real state and its capital is landing . and that i once when camping with cal and my mother , and some family friends , up near higgins lake when i was 9. soon after knowing this , i will stop knowing it again . this has been the community calendar . i tried to explain to cal that something was amiss . i had a sister , not a brother . i was not single but married . i tried to show cal photo of abby , and of my husband , carlos . but when i went to our photo albums , they were different . there were photo of cal and i as children , but none of abby or carlos or steve or janice or this radio station . no en of a recognizable night vale . based on our clothing and the cars and the fashions , no photo was older than – i d say the early 1980 ' s ? there was a picture of me as a teenager at cal ' s wedding . i pointed at her and said , ` ` beth any . still just as radiant , i bet . '' and cal said , ` ` do not ! '' ` ` how is she these days ? '' i asked cal , and he pushed me and shouted , ` ` do not ! '' he started to cry . i kept my eyes down the hall toward the empty office . i knew someone should be in that empty room , someone i c ar ed for , someone i loved but – i did not know who . cal ' s crying turned to sobbing and he is ad , ` ` i ' m sorry i , i did not mean ... '' i put my arm around him and said softly : ` ` i know , i know cal . she . it ' s ok . '' ` ` it ' s just when you asked about beth any , '' he said . ` ` you know she didn't- she didn't- '' he could not finish the sentence , but i knew beth any did not . that year , most people did not . but also that ' s not how it happened . and also , i do not have a brother . he quivered in my arms , and above us , i heard the sky tearing open . smoke in the distance . most days i see distant smoke . ` ` you ok ? '' asked my brother . ` ` yes , '' he said . ` ` thank you for ... thank you for understanding . '' ` ` sure thing , i said to him . ` ` please , leave my house . '' and now , the weather . i do not talk much about my brother on this show . cal . because he ' s not my reality . i almost said he ' s not real , but that ' s not true . there is still a bloodstains on my rug , and a bruise from where he pushed me . i remembered cal ' s wedding . i remembered stealing hood ornaments . i remembered the smell of that rosary bush in that rock garden . but then cal left . he did not drive away , but vanished as the gash tore open above us . i had trouble remembering his visit , so i wrote it all down . i ' m reading it now , to you , verbatim from my journal , and i can not believe my own writing . carlos and his office are back . they were never gone , carlos says . multiple timelines is basic quantum physics , which is the most exciting kind of physics , he said . this morning , i gave carlos a tight hug in bed and kissed him along the back of his beautiful hair – perfect , even when matted symmetrically from sleep . the angels are still standing around the hall of public records , demanding that people look at them . there is one sign that says ` ` we ' re angels , and we ' re totally real , and you ' re making a huge mistake not acknowledging that . trust us , we ' re totally angels . '' and while i appreciate the sentiment , i do think they d be better served hiring a copywriter , or at least a decent graphics designer . holes are tearing open across the sky , and i can barely hear myself thinking most days . the dragons have marched into the city jail freeing all the inmates , mostly political prisoners being held for an unnamed international leader , as well as a handful of college-aged drunk bankers . mayor cardinal , from her home , issued a statement about the disintegration of our town and bleeding together of realities . the statement reads : ` ` my father , who died of liver cancer when i was five , has returned . he arrived from a hole in our reality . i am choosing to go with him , night vale . i am choosing the world where he did not die , where i did not kill my double , where dragons did not destroy our town . listen to the ripping of the firmament and find a world you prefer , night vale . all else is pain . '' listeners . i beg you not to do this . this is the world we built , right here . if you leave , if you do not accept it – it can not hold together . hold tight those you love , night vale . not for fear of their loss , but for love of their presence . hold onto what you know is real . life is only a narrative , but it ' s a narrative we write together . stay tuned next for – huh ? whatever was on the schedule for this month has all been scribbled out with charcoal . and with the same charcoal , someone has scrawled ` ` a story about huntokar '' across the entire broadcast calendar . so stay tuned for that , i guess . and for what it ' s worth , and for however long our own narrative has left , good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : you ' ll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar , but you ' ll catch even more with a corpse of some sort .
WTNV|A Story About Huntokar|1 June 2017|this is a story about huntokar , said a voice on the radio . a voice you had never heard before , though she has been speaking to you your whole life . i am huntokar , the destroyed . you have already been destroyed , you just do not know it yet . once , long before this sorrowful now , there was only the mud womb . we gods waiting to be born . the woman from italy , the distant prince , so many others . we waited for time and space to begin . in the mud womb , nothing ever happened . even the idea of action was impossible . in the mud womb , you were not yet but you knew that some day , you would be . and then history began , and we scattered out into the light and the hours . how simple and easy everything seemed in those first few millennium ! there was only ever one of anything . the woman from italy dipped her hand into the stars , running her fingers through the great glowing coils of the universe . the distant prince explored every firhoff cave and every out of the way hole , all of the dark places . the cloud in the corner of the sky glowed , changing colors every second and dropping dead animals long before animals ever existed . i sat cross-legged in a lake for 10,000 years . but nothing lasts forever , not even us . soon there were other beings in the universe and everything changed . the woman from italy became fascinate at the pain that could be inflicted on these creatures . the distant prince began to shape some of them into wounded servants driven wild by what he had done to them . the glow cloud controlled the minds of any that got too close . and i ? i thought i was the exception . i thought that i would nurtured them , rather than rule them . i was , of all of us , the only good one . but it was i who would end up truly destroying them . i ' ve spent every moment since my mistake trying to put back together what i took apart , but – it is beyond me . every action that endeavours to improve only causes more suffering and terror . even my appearance , once a source of awe , is now to them strange and horrify ing . nothing fits together like it used to . cecil . sweet cecil , who i tried and tried to guide toward the truth . i could never quite say the words . i am the destroyed , i would say to him , but what could he make of that ? my cowardice concealed the details of my crime . i could not bare to repeat them . until now . i say this in every world at once : everyone must understand what happened . this is a story about huntokar . but it ' s also a story about you and them , and every poor soul who hears it . of course i say cecil singular as though there were one of anything . but as we now know , there is not one of anything . there ' s a cecil who would not listen . there ' s a cecil who listened , but could not comprehend . there ' s a cecil who did his utmost but who failed . there ' s a cecil who was gone long before i came . there is cecil and cecil and cecil and cecil and then there is me , trying to explain to him over and over about the choice i made . but all that ever comes out is the truth . i am huntokar , i say . i am the destroyed . all true . all useless . each of us in those early days chose our domain . the glow cloud in the clouds . the distant prince in the distance . the woman from italy everywhere but italy . we could each of us do whatever we wanted in the places we chose . there was no criterion for my choice . i came across a valley , dry , almost lifeless . save for a few brave people who had worked out how they could be sustained there . and i chose them , i guided and taught them , and gradually a town grew . night vale . the one place in the world that was truly mine . i am the creator . and it was , i suppose , in the moment that i first felt love for my creation , that the fuse for the unravelling of all things was lit . although it would not happen for many centuries , but the very inception of my greatest satisfaction and happiness , this tragedy became inevitable . worship of me started , as they became aware of my kind presence in their lives . their love gave meaning to the passing of my years and in exchange , i gave them a better and better world . they developed ceremonies devoted to me , wearing soft meat crowns and building what would become known as blood stone circles . and this is how it was for a long time . night vale was not a place with any distinction to anyone in the world , except for me , who watched over it and loved it . a love that would spell its end . now , in this destroyed world , i am forgotten . still they have blood stones and still they worship , but never does anyone ask : what is being worshipped in those circles ? why do we have all of this meat strapped to our heads ? what once was tribute is now a series of gestures , as human and meaningless as they were before i came along . they see glowing arrows in the sky , dotted lines and circles and they think nothing of them . air traffic , space debris , weird birds . they can not , will not read the messages from their god . the only ones that truly remember me are the oldest ones , the ones that stand outside of time . the careless old woman , who came to this country trying to find some answer to a long ago betrayal . she remembers me , although she would never speak up for me . her ways are ways of sorrow and they only lead her to herself . she is a closed loop of a person . the glow cloud remembers me , but can do no more than flash welcoming colors to say hello . i have no human mind it can control , so there is no way for us to speak . and of course the others , the distant prince , the woman from italy , the five-headed dragons , that ... eagle . they know exactly who i am . and more is the doom of night vale for that . the path to this destruction was laid by the humans . they invented a bomb of utter dread , a weapon so horrible , it could never be used and then threatened to use it . fools ! they faced across the water , squabbling over misunderstood ideas and announcing in louder and louder voices that they were prepared to end their species ' history over a point of pride . some of the gods encouraged it , enjoying chaos and fear as entertainment , and spreading paranoia as they moved through the world . i tried to keep night vale calm . but even my children were not immune to the growing fear . and then the day came , november 7 , 1983. a practice armageddon mistaken for the real thing , and so through this misunderstanding , transformed into actual armaggedon . hm h , the power of a fearful thought . the bombs were in the air , there were only minutes left , the people of night vale huddled waiting for the end to their story . i could see it when it as it was about to happen . i could see the flash and the tower of fire , the heat that transform a body into only its shadow . the slow sickness and the drying of crops , i could see starvation in a winter that would not end . i could see all of this , as though it had already happened . i looked up into the sky , as the people around me wept and said goodby to each other . and i saw something else : a planet of awe some size lit by no sun . an invisible tit an , all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep , turbulent ocean . it hung so close that it filled the entire sky . and that was the moment that i decided , no . i would save them . i would save the town i created , i am the saviour . it was a simple idea . i would have to remove night vale from this ending world . i did not know if it would work ; i had never seen any god try this . but i only had minutes , and i knew that i must save my only town . i was naive , but lovingly so . you should not forgive me just because i had love in my heart . intention never matter . night vale would stand alone , disconnected from all of the rest of the universe , but safe . or , that was what i thought . no action is without consequence . i am the destroyed . what happened next was a horrible cracking noise . a noise like i had never heard before , like no one had ever heard before , because this particular thing had never been broken , not in the history of all possible histories . when i tried to lift night vale out of the world it belonged in , i shattered reality . and i did not shatter reality just in my night vale , but in all night va les . all night va les that were or could be , every possible night vale in every possible universe broke simultaneously and fell into each other . there was a night vale exactly like my night vale , but in which on a single day , a single citizen wore a green shirt instead of a yellow shirt . there was a night vale that had grown into a great metropolis : skyscrapers and crowds and little bars where people sat and talked about the great things they would write when they stopped going out to lit te bars so much . there was a night vale that never was , in a world where humans never came to be . there was a night vale in which old woman josie would never die , and there was a night vale in which she had never lived . there was a night vale in a world that had flooded , and this town floated on the water and thrive , its light spreading iridescent over the waves like an oil s lick . there was a night vale in which there was no huntokar , and this town should have been safe from me , but then all of the other night va les fell into it , and it too was destroyed by my action . every night vale then , every night vale now , every night vale past and present , every town with every possible person making every possible important and unimportant choice , all of them , a fractal of night vale , an endless operation of cecil and citizens , and in my moment of foolish hope , in my belief that i could save anything ... i reached out my clumsy hand and destroyed them all . i guess here is where cecil would say it , so cecil , i ' ll say it for you . let ' s take a look at the weather . night vale is shattered . but for now it ' s still here . hm h , time is startling persistent in that way . even badly wounded , it moves . and so the towns , every possible version of the town , balanced precarious on their broken reality . some versions of the town fell completely into other versions , becoming folded in their reality and unexpected combinations . others merely opened borders with my original night vale , doorways through which travel was possible , but not advisable . for a while , i believed we could go on like this . if we only put our heads down and insisted on living , without looking at or considering the world around us , we could just keep moving . and the main thing was to – keep moving . denial was key . as long as we denied , then nothing was wrong . the other gods were attracted to the site of my entering domain , but i was able to arrange truce s with them . they did not do anything that would upset the balance by which my world barely hung , and in exchange , they could po ke their heads in , look around , maybe take a few versions of my night vale to turn into play grounds for their terror-filled delights . others were drawn , not only gods . there were those who came to help , like the angels that night vale denied as strongly as strongly as they denied their own situation . and there were those who came for debated purposes of their own , like those awful men and their awful crates . the important thing was not a life worth living . the important thing was just a life that continued . but now the five-headed dragons in their grief and anger have pulled all of the other gods into this situation . and our fragile truce is ending . the cracks are widening . all possible night va les are opening up to each other . there will never be only one of anything ever again . when all realities are real , sense can not be made . everything at once is essentially nothing at all . i ' ve tried so hard to keep night vale moving forward , unaware of what happened to it . blissfully ignorant . but my efforts end here . the world is finally falling apart , piece by piece , and i stand by . all the powers of my thousands of years , and i can only watch it fall . cecil , sweet cecil . whose life lies directly on the fault lines of this broken reality . he narrate s his own ending without realizing it is his ending . he does not understand what is happening to him . and so , here i am . telling you this story , so that at least in your destruction , you will understand who has destroyed you . and you will understand that she destroyed only out of a loving desire to save you . may you perceive her as foolish and naive , rather than monstrous . even as i speak i look up into the sky , and see that dark planet of awe some size perched in unless void . invisible tit an , all thick black forests and jagged mountains and deep turbulent ocean . it ' s so close now . i can see it just above me . maybe even , if i tried very hard , i could touch it . this has been a story about huntokar . she who thought she could save . she who , in saving , instead destroyed . i am a story teller . the story may do you no good . huh . but a story is never for the listener . it is always for the one who tells . good night , my night vale . good night . today ' s proverb : less is more . simplification is the way to happiness . you are not your things . anyway , thanks for your wallet , been !
WTNV|Matryoshka|15 June 2017|i once was lost . but now i ' m fine with that . welcome to night vale . steve carlsberg : ah em . first i wanted to say that there are glowing arrows in the sky . you ca not see them even though you should . i can see them . there are dotted lines and arrows and circles . the sky is a chart that explains the entire world . for reference , i printed up this diagram on poster board . notice the arrows here , which curve around the circles . and the dotted lines . it ' s pretty clear if you just look at it . please look at it . you ' re not looking at it ! well , i ' ll just leave it here on this ease and you can look at it later . or while i ' m talking . lots of people like to look at other things while i ' m talking . it puts them at ease . i say things people do not like to hear . i show people things they do not like to see . my brother-in-law sometimes says i give off a smell that people do not like to smell . well , i thought it was funny . it hurt my feelings a bit , but he kept doing it . i mean it was kin da funny , i guess ? cecil palmer : fun fact . did you know that a group of dragons is called a ` ` wear '' ? a pride of lions , a murdering of startings , an ennui of buffalo , and a wear of dragons . interesting , right ? and now the news . there ' s a weir of five-headed dragons burning down city hall right now . there is another weir of dragons stomping great holes in route 800 , the only highway leading out of night vale . and yet one more weir – did you know that it ' s also correct to refer to this as a ` ` flight '' of dragons or even a ` ` thunder '' of dragons ? – tearing open the aqueducts along the town reservoir . more on the complete annihilating of our city , as this story develops . mm . i ' ve gotten several frustrated calls and letters about our program a couple of weeks ago . because the program was called ` ` a story about huntokar '' , many listeners rightly anticipated a story about huntokar . but all they heard was radio static over faint sounds of inhuman screaming . we apologize for the disappointment , and we will more closely review any programs before putting them on the air . i ' m sure it was a tough time for you to voluntarily listen to a sub-par radio program . the town is nearly empty , save for flaming buildings , irate dragons , and a sky that has all but been replaced by an enormous hole , out of which pours continuous darkness , confounding visions and a deafening ripping noise , but again , sorry you did not like that one ... radio show . in related news , the city is in fire , and completely in control of hadassah mcdaniels and the five-headed dragons . the holes that have torn across our sky have merged into one giant hole , and false realities are converging into our town . many citizens , including our mayor , have chosen to run from their own unpleasant reality towards some more pleasant option offered up by the collapsing of all space and time into one . frances donelson , owner of the antique mall , said she discovered a reality where antique were not sentiment , venomous creatures but in fact , just old items one could retell . frances left this night vale last week to go live in another night vale , which occupies the exact same space . bob storm , vice president of finance for the night vale auto insurance company , found a reality where cars were made of stilton cheese , and another where insurance executive made almost 2000 dollars more year on average . he ' s still weighing which reality better suits his lifestyle . steve carlsberg : i see you ' re looking at my chart now ! i think i should have gone with a classier font like helvetica , but this one looks just like the writing in comic strips ! i could not resist , it ' s just so funny ! makes all of these terrible messages so much easier to bare ! these arrows and lines in the sky are a message from someone named huntokar . i learned this on the radio last week . is she a god as she claims ? maybe , although i ' m not religious . the folks over at the joyous congregation said there is no god but the smiling god . i asked if she could be the smiling god , and they asked if she was smiling . i said i did not know , it was on the radio . they made weird gestures with their fists and told me i would know once we were all devoured . i asked my other brother-in-law who ' s a scientist , and he said the arrows and lines were probably a bunch of comes or solar flares or possibly an aroma . then he got really excited about talking about space , and skipped away while laughing and clutching his hands to his chest , so i ' m not sure if there ' s a natural explanation . what i do know is i ' m not the only one who can see them . for a long time , i thought that i was . i told cecil and he scoffed . i told leann hart at the daily journal , and she threw a hatchet at me . i showed them to my daughter janice , but she ' s a teenager and is not really interested in what her parents are interested in . my wife said she believed me , but showed little interest so – i think she was just saying that to be nice . i told mayor cardinal and mayor mitchell before her . mayor cardinal said she would look into it , but i ' m positive she never did . mayor mitchell totally agreed and got really excited about it , but she started telling me about how there ' s a man that lives in the sun , and all he does all day is sit at a little table with a phone on it . the phone is not plugged in , but he waits and waits for it to ring . the man often says to no one , because the sun is so loud and hot an large no one can hear him : ` ` i will receive the call . i can not leave for i do not have an answering machine . but when that phone rings , boy rowdy will that be splendid ! '' based on this story , i ' m positive mayor mitchell and i were talking about different things . for a long time , i thought all of these people did not believe me . they politely or impolitely urged me away from that line of conversation . they said ` ` sure sure '' and ` ` no way '' and ` ` you ' ve got something on your shirt '' , and then they poked my nose when i looked down . i ' ll get to the angels in a second . i promise this relates . cecil palmer : an update on the estate of old woman josie . the hearing to decide the legal ownership of josie ' s estate has been postponed indefinitely , as city hall is completely overrun with dragons , and they ' re not letting anyone schedule the hearing room . not even for , like , 30 minutes . josie ' s daughter allondra ortiz and her lawyer , emilie avare , have claimed that in the absence of a will , the estate should go to the next of kin , in this case allondra . however , the angels who cared for josie in her final years have claimed that they have joined ownership and stake in josie ' s as sets , as they built and maintained her home and helped develop josie ' s cultural foundation . the angels ' biggest hurdle so far in this ugly battle is that they legally – do not exist . as they are angels . the hall of public records is holding a hearing today to determine the validity of the angels ' existence and whether to officially recognize their being . we ' ll report back when a decision has been reached . steve carlsberg : but it ' s not that people do not believe me . they do believe me . you believe me . you just ca not accept it , acknowledge it and understand it . we have customers in our bank all the time who do not want to know their account balance . we can just print it on their receipt , but they always decline because they do not want to know there ' s only 168 dollars and rent is due in a week . they know , but they do not want to have to acknowledge it . which brings me to the angels . they ' re real . you can see them . they ' re standing at the back of the room right now ! and yes , i hear the city ' s ` ` angels acknowledged '' sirens , and i see you sheriff sam , sitting right there in the front row , taking out your handcuffs . but there they are in the back of the room . just turn around ! look ! they ' re super tall , and have several arms and long faces and wings . you see them ? they ' re the ones that glow bright black and sound like french horns . yeah , them . wave at them . they ' re waving back ! there are a great many crises facing our town . the holes in the sky , the dragons chasing us into hiding , the woman of italy threatening to flay us alive . the distant prince slowly creeping less distant . all of the unrepaired pot holes , all kinds of stuff that may seem more important than a simple clerical matter of existence . but i ask the city officials present , the administrators of the hall of public records , the people of night vale , please legalized the acknowledgment of these angels ! they are protectors . they have saved our city from evil corporate encampment , from that eagle . they built us an opera house . they cared for old woman josie through ho spice . they are recorder . they memories our history without judgment . they are beggars . they have like a billion dollars in our bank , but they constantly roam the streets asking people for ten bucks . it ' s not because they need money , it ' s because they need connection . they just want to know you heard them ask . cecil palmer : : listeners , i ' m getting word that the dragons have stopped their ram page across town . no more burning buildings or crushed cars of devouring of pets . every single dragon in town has gathered out in the scrub lands near the sand wastes . they are facing outward toward the mountains , silently watching – for something . the city is quiet again . i do take some comfort in not hearing shouts for help or glass shatter ing . it is a relief to not hear reptilian roars or car alarms , to not see plumes of smoke . there ' s so little solace , an inexplicable peace . the chaos in our streets was – normal , predictable . i mean it was upsetting , but we knew why it was happening . but for no clear reason , the dragons have stopped . something they have not done since they began months ago . the last remnants of the sky ... have gone . there are hundreds of people out wandering the streets , but they are not actually here . they ' ve living in some other night vale that is not attacked by dragons , some other reality that is not in flames , i-i-i-i can see them . solid figures moving through – each other . unaware of the layers , upon layers , of reality . my brother returned to see me last night . but i do not have a brother . nearly all of his hair and teeth were gone and he could barely walk . every few steps he would fall only to get back up and walk slowly again toward me . line of dried blood down the front of his po lo shirt . he could not speak , only groaned . ` ` the bomb '' , over and over . ` ` the bomb ! '' he grabbed my arm . and i could not pull away , i only said , ` ` you ' re not real . '' but he just stared distant ly , as only a person who has seen death can stare . people ask me all the time , ` ` are we at the end ? is this it ? '' and i tell them no . we must keep moving forward , that ' s all we can do . but ... i ' m lying . i can hold tight to what i think is real here , but it ' s done no good , i ' m just one person . i ' m afraid we ' ve broken it . we ' ve . broken . night vale . i am so sorry . stay tuned next for ... everything . nothing . and for one , last time , from the voice of your town to all listeners out there : goodby , night vale . goodby . hang on . i just thought of something . while i figure this out , have a listen to today ' s weather . steve carlsberg : unless we pay attention to our true reality , all will be lost . i believe recognizing angels is a vital first step . it ' s like my brother-in-law saying mean things all the time . i tried to ignore the mean bits , i just put my head down and kept moving . the main thing was to keep moving , not to bog down in tears and fights and emotions . just move forward , because facing it would mean pain . but then a few weeks ago , i looked him in the eye and said , ` ` stop . '' he looked shocked . i inhaled and just as i did , he did too . and in a synchronously moment of breath , i started crying . i was not weeping in sadness , i was just crying from the intimacy of truly seeing someone and having them see me . we were vulnerable and raw and i said , ` ` it hurts me when you joke . if you do not like me , just tell me why and we can work through it . and he told me about his childhood and his mother , and his tumultuous relationship with his sister , and how difficult it is to let strangers into his world . and it was just easier for him to keep me as an interlopers in his life . i could never understand his difficult childhood . and i said he was right , but that i could try . he let me hug him . he even hugged back , which is rare for cecil . he stopped saying rude jokes about me . in fact , even saying nice things about me . we acknowledged our issues . nothing is perfect , and i do not think it will be , but it is better . perfection does not exist ! all we can hope for is better . thank you , officers of the hall of public records , for letting me speak at the hearing here today . cecil palmer : my brother-in-law steve carlsberg did not know old woman josie , not like i did . i loved her like a mother . steve did not know the angels , either . i ' m sure he had heard me talk about them , i ' m sure like all of us he had seen them , and known them to be real , but averted his eyes for fear of violating the arcade law against acknowledging angels . yet , he went to the hearing to support them . because i am doing the show today , i could not attend the hearing . a hearing i desperately wanted to be at , to proclaim my passion , to change our out of date laws . i am sad i could not . but steve told me he would speak for me at the hearing . he listened attentively as i told him everything i felt about the issue , and then he said , ` ` it ' s like the arrows in the sky , theatre dotted lines '' , and i rolled my eyes , because steve has always been a conspiracy theorist , seeing patterns where there are none . he got upset at my dismissiveness . um , my sister abby and i rarely got along , but after our mother died , that began to change . i spent so much time with her , and with her infant daughter janice , whose spina bifida was costly and and and terrifying and exhausting . and then abby met steve , and steve took care of janice financially , and of abby spiritually , and i was just an uncle again . i was no longer wringing my hands every day over the health of this struggling girl anymore , i was not spending away my savings on medical care , i was not having to comfort a sobbing mother . and steve took all that away from me . you can read that two ways . steve relieved me from stress or , steve relieved me from duty . i interpreted it as the latter . it ' s hard to forgive him for simply being a responsible father and stepfather but ... i ' m learning to let my anger go . i ' ve said terrible things about steve . and he ' s been nothing but supportive of me , of my sister , of my niece . he is a good father , and brother-in-law , and a good citizen of night vale . he is a patient friend , and i love him for that . i think , i even think his arrows in the sky theory might be right . did you - did you ever have one of those dolls that opens up , and inside is another doll , and inside that another ? i , uh ... i sometimes think we are one of those dolls , inside a similar doll and outside a similar doll . each one nest led in another , infinite possible dolls all in one visible doll . but all of the dolls have been opened and removed from one another . they ' re split halves strewn across the floor . which parts go together ? and which doll are we ? did our doll have the blood hair or the brown hair ? the red bow or the one with the green-laced trim , the headscarf with the flora print ? or the dotted print ? the angels hearing is completed , and the hall of public records has officially recognized the existence of angels as night vale citizens . the angels celebrated with poorly aimed high-fives , which were warmly reciprocated by fellow non-angel citizens , now legally allowed to see the angels as real . the recognition and acknowledgment of angels seems a small victory , in light of our ending world , but as i speak to you now ... part of the sky has returned . ah , as has hiram mcdaniels . out in the scrublands , the gathered dragons welcomed back one of their own . hiram had left town to be alone , to gather himself . his violet head was executed by night vale officials last year – the incident that spark ed this entire conflict . hiram spoke to the other dragons . ` ` a great injustice has been perpetrated upon me , '' his gold head announced in a quiet , tired voice . ` ` we ' ve been trying to make sense of why it happened , '' his blue head said . ` ` we ' ve been very emotional , '' his grey head said , ` ` but we are learning to let go of our anger , '' his green had shouted hoarsely . hiram asked that the dragons leave night vale and all return back to their world . ` ` we have truce s to uphold . they attacked me only because they are scared of me , '' his gold head said . ` ` we can not find forgiveness in relentlessness . '' there was a grumbling in dissent . but the dragons have called off their attack for now . but it was not the dragons who tore open our sky and split our realities . we are not safe merely because there is peace . we are the ones who tore apart our realities by refusing to see them for what they were . our years of denial , carefully cultivated , has made our reality fragile . look at the angels , night vale , they are real . they always have been , right there in front of us they are – our protectors and we denied them . we loved old woman josie so much and yet , we could not accept those whom she loved as her own family . look what we did to hiram ! he conspired to kill our mayor , but the one head that tried to stop the others ? was the one we executed . and in the throes of our town ' s iron-clad denial , we could not own up to our mistake . it ' s one wooden doll inside many similar wooden dolls , and if we do not notice the little details ... we wo not know which one we are when they are all dismantled . as the dragons began to leave our town , mayor dana cardinal approached them and asked for forgiveness for the death of violet . ` ` the destruction of our town did not bring violet back , it did not fix anything . i remain fearful and angry at you for this , '' she said . ` ` but that does not change the fact that i made a grave error . hiram . i am sorry . '' the dragons paused to hear her words , and when she finished , they left night vale without reply . and a bit of the sky returned . following the hearing , allondra ortiz said she was incredibly moved by the angels ' case , that she had never really thought of them as anything but imaginary freeholders . but now that she had taken time to see how much love and effort they put into josie ' s health , life , and artistic endeavours , she plans to re work her claim on her mother ' s estate to include only personal items and heirlooms . she also said she would like to stay in night vale a little while longer , spend time with her mother ' s friends . and a bit of the sky returned . members of the vague yet menacing government agency resumed their routine of following people and recording private conversations , and those under surveillance waved hello at the agents . ` ` have you ever noticed , '' we all asked each other , ` ` that we are being watched by secret agents ? that ' s not normal , that does not happen in normal places . '' and a bit of the sky returned . the librarian slithered - or possibly skittered ? – back into the library , ready to devour book lovers . the city council returned to their chambers after a much needed vacation in the catskills , except for their newest member , 16-year-old tamika lynn who , instead of vacation ing amass ed a disturbing amount of weaponry . ` ` most towns , i think , are not run by literal monsters and heavily armed teenager , '' we said to each other . and a bit of the sky returned . the radiation-sick man in my home named cal is gone , once again . as are the countless layers of people walking our streets , but existing in some other streets . as the angels were acknowledged as truly existing , the other realities began to fade , as we began to accept the full reality of our world . as mayor cardinal remembered that her father had died years ago , and the father she was with was not her reality . as we looked each doll over carefully , we began to truly notice the fine details of what made ours particular and special . we could nest le them all back together into a single doll , each multitude safely contained . and the last bit of the sky - returned . now our reality is badly damaged , and the only thing keeping it together is our acknowledgment . finally , this strange town that we live in , no more denial . we must see ourselves clearly , or risk losing ourselves forever . angels are real . our town is a deeply weird place . we know and acknowledge that it is a deeply weird place . there are dotted lines and arrows in the sky , and i love my family . and i love my brother steve , he was right about everything , he always has been . so stay tuned next for eye contact and breathing , in unison . and as always , and for as long as i can keep saying it : good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : if you only read one book this year , then you have reached your approved book quota .

WTNV|The Retirement of Pamela Winchell|15 August 2014|one . not everyone believes in mountains . yet , there they are , in plain sight . scientists insist , rather halfheartedly , that mountains are the bulging results of teutonic shifts along massive rocky plates . mountains develop naturally over the course of many millennium , scientists say under their breaths . most people believe that mountains are not there at all , even if mountains are visible , as they often are . nonbelievers will explain that our minds create sensory illusions to help explain what we can not understand . like the shapes of gods and monsters in the stars , or messages in tea leaves , or government codes in cloud patterns . mountains , real or not , ring this desert like the rim of an empty dinner plate . scattered scarcely along the flat middle are small towns with names like red me sa , pine cliff , and right in the center , night vale . above night vale are helicopter protecting citizens from themselves and others . above the helicopter are stars , which are completely meaningless . above the stars is the void , which is completely meaningful . through this crowded sky mysterious lights often pass . these are just alien space crafts , or the au ras left by inter-dimensional travelers , but these simple explanations are boring . the people of night vale often come up with elaborate stories to explain the lights to themselves . the sky once loved a certain rock , but millennium of erosion transformed the rock to dust . the sky , not understanding , still signals for its friend who abandoned it . the rock never knew about the sky . the rock only loved the wind that was slowly eroding it . sometimes it ' s ok to find something beautiful without correctly understanding it . in the center of night vale , like in many cities , is its downtown with the usual things a downtown has . city hall , community radio station , hooded figures , a library , a shimmering vortex blocked off with yellow police tape . dangerous stray dogs , and propaganda loudspeakers on every corner . beyond downtown is old town night vale , a residential and shopping area planned and developed during the booming economy of the early 1930 ' s . after the war , the neighborhood fell into dis repair but in recent years , it has seen a genesis of home owners , neighborhood shops , tall metal trees , and predator cats . beyond old town night vale are the sand wastes , which are exactly what you think they are . and beyond the sand wastes are the scrublands , which are sort of what you think they are . and beyond the scrublands is the used car lot and old woman josie ' s house , and finally , out on the edge of town , the house of larry le roy . larry had lived by himself for as long as he could remember . he owned a phone which was broken and a car , which sat heelless at op four blocks of concrete out back . hidden under the car , he had an underground shed full of canned goods and bottled water , and a year ' s worth of pork sausage preserved in animal fat . he used to have a shot gun , but he traded it for the car without wheels , figuring a car without wheels was safer than a shot gun . despite the friendly reminders from the night vale chapter of the national rifle association : ` ` guns do not kill people , guns are the new ka le , guns are healthy as all get-out '' , larry never felt safe around guns . when he was in his early 30 ' s , larry ' s father took him hunting . he did not like his father . he did not hate him , either . once when larry reached into the back of his dad ' s pick up to grab the shot gun , a scorpion resting on the barrel had stung larry ' s hand . he had distrusted guns ever since . these days , larry actually liked scorpions . after all they eat squirrel , which he really hated . he rarely paid much attention to the illogical way in which the human mind develops certain photius . this evening , he bent over the shoe box on his desk . he was carefully pa sting a tiny brown mustache he d made from a sliver of tree bark , to a tiny web . dubois ' face . he still needed to build the arm-mounted laser canon dubois was known for . larry heard what sounded like the small claws of squirrel running around in his basement , and he hoped the scorpions were hungry . he turned his attention to his miniature version of the five-headed dragon named rachel mcdaniels , that dubois often rode when speaking . dubois spoke from a place of moral and physical authority to the intellectual and politicians , who stood in the way of equal rights for black americans . he also spoke from the back of a flying dragon . larry was building a drama celebrating dubois ' famous defeat of the german army in 1915 , depicting him and rachel in their library , high-fiving upon a copy of the declaration of surrender . larry adored this war hero and great orator of civil rights . he enshrined dubois in fine detail in the cardboard shoe box . larry ' s family never cared much for history , often telling him history did not exist , because it was no longer happening . the moment anything occurred , they would say every night at dinner , it was gone . delegated to the fiction of memory . they would say that with their heads bowed , and then they would begin eating . perhaps he had been a rebellious youth . or perhaps he d just wanted to explore the often wondrous , often tragic myth of human history . larry adored his heroes . web . dubois . helen keller . red fox . lui s val des . to ni morrison . he believed it was his responsibility to help carry on their legacy by enshrining their great stories and deeds so that they still felt present in the present . history is real , regardless of truth , larry often said – not with words , but with his actions . tiny clothing , facial hair , painted set models , most pieces no bigger than any one of larry ' s fingers . they took a steady eye , a steady hand . unlike most men , he had grown more steady as he aged , more dexterous in his lack of speed . he expert ly placed dubois ' mustache below the great intellectual ' s nose and set the weepers down to begin working on the drama ' s library backdrop . larry heard a whirring hum . he felt it throughout his body . there were undulations in the waves of the noise , smooth up s and down , easily lull ing the unconscious mind of a man hard at work . the troughs and crests of sounds accelerated , soon going from steady ululations to a bump roar . the metal plates and cups in his hand-built kitchen were the first to start rattling , followed by the creaking of the roof against the metal tresses . he glanced at the earthquake calendar tacked to his wall . agents from a vague yet menacing government agency delivered these calendars each month , sliding a manila envelope under the door in the middle of the night . according to the calendar , there was no earthquake schedule for today . he looked down at web . dubois and rachel mcdaniels in their vast academic library . a drop of larry ' s sweat the size of dubois ' head landed on mcdaniels ' back , smudging the paint and knocking off the freshly glued spines . larry wiped his brow . he did not sweat often even in the desert heat . ` ` it ' s a dry heat , '' people from the desert often say to others , trying to disguise the fact that they ' re bidding themselves . but the heat today was unusual . he felt it not from the air , but from below his boots , and not the heat of the sun , but a friction . the sun underneath his plood floor burned , like two worlds rubbing together . his sleepless brown undershirt was drenched dark down its sides . he heard the crash of metal plates and cups falling out of the doorless cabinet . the ground , his house , his whole self , shook . it was not the soft wobbling slide of a government-run earthquake . this felt like being punched from below . the desert was being pound ed by a giant subterranean fist . as he stood and staggered into the living room , there was another hard thumb and shake of his house . larry tripped forward , face first , into the frame around his open front door . he was not afraid put for his dramas . he knew one day there would be an end to all of this , and long before that , there would be an end to larry . he was not so arrogant as to refer to his own death as the end . just one of billions of ends before the end . death is only the end if you assume the story is about you . he knew one day he would be found deceased in his home out on the edge of town . he was unbothered by this . he may not have had children , but the legacy provided by children is limited . few people know the details of their family past their great-grandparents , and many people do not even remember that generation . two generations of memory is all that children provide . and then , everyone is forgotten . but he would leave behind stacks of writing , dramas , and patchwork quilts . he had a handmade history : his attempt to offer immortality to heroes and perhaps extend his own story as well . instead of a brief obituary in the night vale daily journal , he wanted his death to be a story of the discovery of his great collections , the work of his then finished life . he had already written letters for sarah sultan , president of the night vale community college ; instructions to donate his dramas to the school ' s art department ; leann hart , editor of the daily journal ; and cecil palmer , host of the community radio station . an obituary he had written for himself , and also ones for leann and cecil . and michelle nguyen , owner of dark owl records , who would no doubt be pleased to inherit larry ' s vast collection of polk music written , performed , and recorded himself using a concerning and a micro cassette recorder . michelle loathed any music popular enough to have been heard by more than her and the dark owl staff , so larry ' s tunes would be welcome . according to his will , the letters were to be delivered and his belongings distributed accordingly . his artistic and academic endeavors were his children . a legacy that would hopefully last for much longer than two forgetful human generations . he could feel the bruise beginning to form on his cheek from where he ran into the doorframe . he turned back into the house . the pound ing from below was bringing down his kitchen and living room . he watched as the walls and ceiling collapsed and twisted into dust and scrap . pages of his books and personal writing scattered up toward the helicopter and stars above and fluttered lazily in the wind like unmotivated pigeons . lurching forward , arms straight out , using the walls for balance , he rounded the corner back into his art studio . his dubois and mcdaniels drama was slightly damaged , but irrecoverable . he picked it up . the wall of other dramas was still there , decades of meticulous work and loving craftsmanship . his ` ` pride and prejudice '' drama , which had been his first , still showed the inconsistencies of a neophyte , but also the bravery of a young artist . elizabeth bennett ' s sword was soaked with blood ; larry had used his own . and for her eyes , he had used polished onya . from wherever you stood in the room , bennett appeared to be staring you down with the passion and vengefulness this dangerous literary villain was known for . he set the dubois box down on the work table and walked toward his wall of dramas . the long plexiglass windows were secured and locked over the displays . the thumping floor jostled him violently . he tugged a bit on each shelf , seeing they were safe , but needing to touch them all to believe it . crack ! the footboard below larry split . he lost his balance , but regained it against the support column next to the shelves . another loud thumb , and half the portable buckled into a sinkhole growing in the floor . he saw dubois ' box sliding down toward the opening . he jumped . he rarely jumped or did anything quickly , but now he did both . he grabbed the box , then stepping with his right foot onto the sinking table , he pushed off , hurling himself uncontrolled into the far wall , but managing to cradle the drama of his favorite orator securely to his chest . it was silent for a long moment , just larry breathing . he heard a drop of sweat tap the floor below him . the earth was hot . his feet were beginning to cramp . his head was light . he took dubois outside and set the box gently on the ground , safely away from the shaking building . he grabbed his wheelbarrow out of the ditch and raced back into the collapsing house . he tossed any important documents he could find , along with his letters to the people of night vale into the wheelbarrow . he grabbed the poems and plays he had written . he rushed back into his studio , his arms straining , wheelbarrow already half full . he set his dramas carefully at op one another in the wheelbarrow , his life ' s work , a delicate pyramid of paint , plastic , and paper . he heard the ceiling creak . he placed jane austin ' s masterpiece on top of the others in the wheelbarrow . as he did , a loud pop and a harsh crutch . his ears were ringing immediately . he fell , or rather slid to his knees . the floor buckled . the empty shelves collapsed . he glanced down into the hole . he saw dirt and wood and plexiglass falling , falling and hitting – nothing . in that hole , he saw a deep endless nothing . the floor tore away , the wood bending down into the hole below . he struggled to keep his boots ' grip on the steely angle d floor . he gave the wheelbarrow a strong push , knowing if he did not make it , he d at least give the dramas a fighting chance . the cart lurched a couple of feet and then began rolling back toward him . the pyramid of his life ' s work quivered on the verge of tumbling . his boots were sliding . larry gave one more great shove with his calves , his knees unbent , his body thrust upward . he pushed up the sloping floor , straining but eventually gaining traction and then momentum . he rolled his cart off the top edge of the pit , leaping as if from a ram p into the living room , away from the growing hole behind him . he turned the corner and ran out the front door . as daylight dwindled slowly across the desert , larry emerged onto the ratio . out toward the sunset , away from the collapsing home and toward a collapsing earth . the front lawn , mere pebble dirt and leaflets shrub , was gone . everything up to the ditch was an empty pit . the earth before him was completely gone , and with it web . dubois and rachel mcdaniels . larry barely had time to process what had happened when there came one more thumb . he did not know it yet , but it would be the last and the most terrible . the front few steps gave way to an explosion of sand . his palms burned as the wood hand les of the wheelbarrow were wrenched from his hands . elizabeth bennett ' s eyes flashed an angry orange as she fell along with the other enshrined heroes into oblivion . he watched everything that proved he ever had existed fall into the nothing below . behind him , he heard the remainder of his house collapse into the pit as well . he stood on a patch of wood in an open doorframe surrounded by a growing , gaping nothing . he stared at the earth dropping away around him , he stared at the stars and the void , which were falling upward away from him . as the ground under his feet dropped away , as he started his fall toward the deep nothing below , larry did not believe what he was seeing . of course , he did not believe mountains were real either , yet there they were , in plain sight . if only for a few seconds more . joseph f ink : hello again . that was an except from the novel ` ` it devours ! '' which is out on october 17 , and is available for recorder right now . regular welcome to night vale episodes resume on august 1 , plus we have a very exciting new show that is joining the night vale presents family around that same time , so keep an eye out for that . thanks for listening , have a good summer , or winter if you ' re in that part of the world .
WTNV|Summer 2017, Night Vale, USA|1 August 2017|a friendly desert community where the sun is hot , the moon is beautiful , and mysterious lights pass overhead while we lay open-eyed , watching it all . welcome to night vale . the city council reiterated for the 1874 th consecutive day that the dog park is off limits for both dogs and humans . the fence is electrified and highly dangerous , et cet era . hooded figures and all that . since its construction , we have shied from and feared the dog park . the dog park is neither a park nor for dogs , so what does it even mean to call it a dog park ? why do we use language that means one thing to describe something that is entirely else ? i do not know what the word for that place the city council calls the dog park , but i do know it ' s time to start searching for that word , and once found , to use it boldly . the angels – who i can know say are angels and will say are angels because they are angels held a memorial for old woman josie in her house . everyone in town came , overcome with the feeling that finally , they could look at these beings and recognize them for what they were . even the city council attended the memorial , but refused to make eye contact with anyone . of course , this positive concrete identification only led to more mysteries . for if these are angels , then where did they come from , and what does that mean for us ? even now we find that we can not voice these questions . not because we are not allowed , but because we can not find the words to ask . instead , we ate cake and drank coffee in the living room of old woman josie , which was once just that , the place she lived . now , it is only a room . one by one , we laid our hand on the angel ' s hands , and in that moment of contact , each of us in turn found ourselves weeping . as the party wound down , we all heard a soft pop outside . it was the lightbulb on old woman josie ' s porch , burning out . a man who i know very well came into my house today , which is also his house . he laid his head with its perfect and beautiful hair upon my shoulder and crossed his arms over his perfect and beautiful lab coat . i embraced him . we are creatures of touch , humans . and we retrieve so much meaning and happiness from contact . ` ` i ' ve become too complacent , '' he said . ` ` when i came here , i understood this town as scientific ally fascinating . and then , gradually , it became my day to day life . i could no longer see the strangeness , but only my home . '' ` ` we are all guilty of that , '' i said . ` ` but i ' m a scientist , '' he said . ` ` well , '' i said , ` ` we have all been scientists at one point or another in our lives . '' just a reminder to all the parents out there . let ' s talk about safety when taking your children out to play in the scrublands and the sand wastes . you need to give them plenty of water , make sure there ' s a shade tree in the area , and keep an eye on the helicopter colors . i asked my best friend and brother , steve , to talk me through which helicopter belong to which organizations . obviously the black helicopter belong to the world government . although i had not realized until steve laid it out for me , how closely they are also associated with the liza rd people . the blue ones are sheriff ' s secret police . the pink ones are the new double secret police . and the ones painted with complex morals depicting birds of prey diving ? well , not even steve knows what those helicopter are , nor what they want . on steve ' s chart , those are just labelled with the word ` ` run '' . and then a few hundred exclamation points . a commercial airline flying through local air space disappeared today , only to reappear at the fifth hole of the sagebrook pin es private golf club and bulk supplier . this disrupted all golf activities badly , as well as sca ring a family of four who were per using bulk paper towels offered at a discount price in a nearby sand trap . i feel , for the first time , that i can articulate that this airline had flown into some other universe , those divisions being particularly thin here in our quaint little community . this also is the cause of things like dead relatives occasionally joining us for breakfast , or the shimmering skyscrapers and crowded cities that appear for flashing moments in the sky . of course , it also could be the handiwork of the east night vale cacti , the basketball team at the new east night vale elementary school . those scamps are always pulling pranks . could they transport a large plane through multiple universe ? who am i to say ? but probably yes . for shame , east night vale ! for shame ! my husband and our town ' s friend and protector carlos called a town meeting . he thought we had not checked in with each other in a while and wanted us to have a moment where we came face to face , and saw those faces , and remembered that we are all real and all affect each other . erika and erika of the newly acknowledged angels brought corn muffins.. which were inedibly sal ty . they explained that angels just ca not get enough salt . dana cardinal was there , not as our mayor but as a citizen , one who is so young for the responsibility that has been thrust on her . tamika lynn was there , not as a city council member , but as a citizen , one who is so young for the responsibility she has seized with an army of loyal and extremely well armed tens . please see my up coming editorial on why millennials are always joining armed te en militia . ugh , millennials ! carlos reminded us that we are by far the most scientific ally interesting town in the country , and we joined hands and nodded , because boy , do not we know it ! we have clear eyes now . we see ourselves for who we are , but more importantly , we see each other . we are still a community . the night vale business association is proud to announce the refurbishment of the night vale harbor and waterfront recreation area . now you might remember that these facilities have always been absolutely beautiful , eco-friendly , and with a pedestrian-focused design . however , they have suffered poor attendance due to the complete lack of water in the desert . but this is where things have changed . the night vale business association said , in a press release that they drunken sung in unison out in my yard last night . the recent problems we had with other universe intruding on our own resulted in a great deal of pain and loss . but it has left us with an ocean . this ocean is only visible from the waterfront recreation area ' s boardwalk , and viewed from any other angle , the area still appears to just be the usual sagebrush and rocks . carlos said he does not understand how this window into another world works , and warned that no one should attempt to touch the ocean , for we do not know what turks within it . but , he said , there could be no harm in a sunset stroll along the boardwalk , listening to the soft hiss of the retreating waves . the local chapter of the n ra is selling bump er stickers as part of their fundraising week . the stickers are made from good sturdy vinyl , and they read , ` ` we genuinely do not value human life . '' cut e ! carlos and his scientists , like louisa and nilanjana , are renew ing their investigation into the house in the development of desert creek , out back of the elementary school . the house that does not actually exist . ` ` it seems like it exists , '' muttered carlos , ` ` like it ' s just right there when you look at it . and it ' s between two other identical houses , so it would make more sense for it to be there than not . '' but he says , it is actually a doorway into another world , a world he himself was stuck in for a year . there seem to be secrets about that year he ' s keeping to himself . maybe some day we will learn what they are . lights seen in the sky above the arby ' s . not the glowing sign of arby ' s , something higher and beyond that . one night years ago , two people scared and vulnerable and loving and ready came together for a quiet moment under that sky , and i pretended at the time to understand the lights . but a big part of recognizing the world for what it is is recognizing when you have no idea . invaders from another world ? harbingers of future terror ? a fragment of other universe , fading into our own above reasonably priced lunchmeat ? maybe any . maybe all . maybe none . but here is what i do know : the lights are , among other things , a part of my memory and a part of my marriage , and a part of my love . they are a piece of my past and i do not need to understand them to understand that . ladies and gentlemen , the past is here , and it ' s about a hundred feet above the arby ' s . carlos and louisa say that the monitoring station near route 800 is recording wild seismic shifts , even as our ground reminds completely still . he suspects that this might be because multiple universe are colliding , creating earthquakes that are undetectable in the third dimension . ` ` picture our worlds entertaining , '' he said . ` ` and here we are in the coil , the friction of every possibility coming into contact , shaking the very structure of chance and fortune , '' he said . well , submit an insurance claim anyway and see what you can get , right ? listeners , the traffic . police are issuing warnings about the ghost cars out on the highways , those cars only visible in the distance , reaching unimaginable speed s , leaving destination unknown for destination more unknown . it seems that the ghost cars have taken to drag racing on weekend , which poses a hazard to both pedestrians and other drivers . the police indicate that they will be arresting whatever beings drive these cars , as soon as they can figure out how to pull one over . and now – the weather . the sun did not set at the correct time today or any other day , carlos and nilanjana reported . they are quite certain about that . they checked several blocks . but , they said , the sunset was really beautiful , so at least there ' s that . carlos still does not have any explanations , but he did suggest that while time is especially weird in night vale , time is weird anyway . mostly people do not notice in the rest of the world , because while time is weird there , it ' s always weird in the same way , and so is mistaken for being remote ly understandable . it ' s easy to forget in this hot , hot , desert climate , but things would actually be slightly harder for us without the sun . we know this because there was a version of night vale in some other universe in which the sun did not exist . and that version of night vale was terrible . ugh , just no good at all ! their street plan did not make a lick of sense , for one thing . there was no flow to any neighborhood ! i ' m glad i live in my sunny night vale , and not any other . the city council would like to remind you about the tired heavens and the hierarchy of angels . the reminder is the council is grumpy that all of this is not forbidden knowledge , but due to the new laws , they are required to inform you that the angels have made all of that information available . stop by the house where the angels live if you want to pick up a free packet outlining exactly how all of that is organized . while the packet itself is free , it is likely the angels will ask to borrow five dollars . they tend to do that . over at the desert flower bowl ing alley and arcade fun complex , terry williams , its owner , reported the startling news that there is nothing under the pin retrieval area of lane 5. as you may remember , there has been a tiny city of warlike people under the bowl ing alley for several years now . which has caused some trouble , although not a lot of trouble , because they were very tiny people . but now there is just a hole in the earth under the pin retrieval area , an empty space containing only my own memories of a night that someone i loved almost died , before i had a chance to truly love him . so good radiance to whatever that town was . carlos , perfect and beautiful , came into our studio during the break earlier and we ate lunch together out of tupperwares . he had some sort of blinking box in his hand , covered with wires and tubes . when he put it close to the microphone it sounded like – well , like a bunch of baby birds had just wo ken up , really went crazy . he asked if i remembered it . he had brought it by on the first day we had met . he had told me that it tested for materials , but he was not actually sure what materials it tested for . he had just wanted an excuse to come by and talk to me . ` ` anyway '' , he said , ` ` i thought it was a nice memento back when we were fumbling awkwardly toward this life we share . '' ` ` but , '' he added , ` ` it ' s a real instrument that is detect ing some actual materials of some kind , so there is a good chance that everything about this studio is deeply dangerous . please , be careful . '' then we fed khoshekh , the cat floating in one of the bathroom here at the station . carlos pointed out cats do not float . i stared at khoshekh , having never really thought about that . after a bit i said , ` ` this one does . '' carlos smiled , petted khoshekh between the eyes and went back to his work , and i went back to mine . this is my work , listeners . my work is to speak to you all . to talk you through the day , to murmur you into the night . settling in to be another clear and pretty evening here in night vale , this weird , weird , town . i hope all of you out there have someone to sleep through it with . i know i do . good night , listeners , good night . today ' s proverb : there is no proof you exist , only evidence . .
WTNV|Citizen Spotlight|15 August 2017|if you see something crawling across your floor in the dark , do not worry . it ' s probably just a tarantula . welcome to night vale . listeners , in this fast-paced world of community radio and local news , i think we ' ve lost sight of the truly important thing : the individuals who make up our diverse community . so today , i want to try out a new segment i ' ve put together called citizen spotlight , in which we will profile a random selected citizen , diving deep into who they are , and maybe discovering some things about ourselves along the way . oh , here ' s an into i ' m working on for it . footlights , roving in the night . hunting . closing in . but everything is backwards . the night is hot and bright . the footlights are deep and black . everything they touch turns to darkness . they are searching for the light . they consume it . that ' s a rough draft . i ' m open to notes . anyway , today ' s inaugural spotlight was curate by closing my eyes and pointing in the phone book . and so today , we will talk about sigrid b org . she ' s a brand new citizen who has just arrived in night vale . i have hear this classified dossier , we had a team of he ist experts – thanks , janice – steal from the hall of public records . the dossier says that sigrid was re located to night vale as part of a witness protection program , and that sigrid is not her real name . nor is she of the scandinavian origin her name might suggest . thus all of the information we managed to obtain on sigrid for this segment is fiction al , created by a government software program to ensure her total anonymity , and in no way represents who she really is as a person . in all probability , it is in most ways the opposite of her true identity , but for safety , it ' s important that we all believe this made-up biography is absolute fact . it is extremely , extremely important . she would be in great danger if anyone from the outside world started to doubt who she claimed to be . we ' ll get to our citizen spotlight momentarily , but first , as a way to make sigrid feel more at home , i ' ve asked other night vale citizens to reveal a dark secret that they ' ve never shared . i will be reading those throughout today ' s broadcast . the first comes from susan eschar , second grade teacher at night vale elementary school . she writes : ` ` one night , i was at school late grading homework , and i heard strange sounds coming from the cafeteria . when i looked inside , i saw a giant mandala on the floor made entirely of frozen fish sticks . it seemed to be undulating and alive . when i blinked , it vanished . but every night i dream of flying toward a cloudless sky , and in the center of that sky is that fish stick mandala . and i wake before i reach it , but each dream a little closer . and the night that i reach that mandala in my dream is the night i will die . '' thanks susan ! sounds fun . now let ' s talk about sigrid . though new to town , sigrid b org was born in night vale and has lived here her entire life . her parents were immigrants from the picturesque swedish port city of halmstad . she tries to go back at least once a year to visit her grandparents , a retired grade school teacher and a retired timber farmer , who have a lovely cottage overlooking at the mouth of the nissan river , where it meets the north sea . sigrid has always been close with her grandparents , though in recent visits , has become distressed at her grandmother ' s increased mental confusion and grandfather ' s drinking habits . she does not call them as often she used to and feels guilty about that . she ' s torn between the desire to take more responsibility for their health and well being and the desire to block the situation out of her mind completely , as it has become a signifies of the irrevocable loss of her own childhood , and a direct confrontation with morality itself . sigrid ' s favorite food is smorgåstårta , a scandinavian layer cake that is made of sandwiched and fish paste . ask her to make it for your next big event . she ' s been carefully drilled by her witness protection handlers on the foods of her childhood , and has almost got the hang of making them , although she has failed to acquire a taste for fish paste . some fun facts that you may not know about sigrid , despite having lived in the same town with her all your lives . she has a degree in marine hauntology from an online university . she has a disorder that makes it impossible for her to sweat or cry . she has served on the board of the sand wastes conservation fund for six and a half years . she is deeply embedded into our community and way of life . and now , another confession from a local resident about a dark secret . this one from my dear friend earl harlan . it reads : ` ` on a boy scout training maneuver near the old dirt road , i witnessed the apparition of my 10-year-old self wearing the scout uniform of my youth . he trained with us all afternoon , and i tried not to give him any deferential treatment . as the afternoon passed , new memories appeared in my mind of training at 10 years old with a group of strangers , one of whom seemed familiar and stared at me constantly in horror . '' that ' s adorable ! thanks , earl ! back to citizen spotlight . sigrid spent her childhood in the hetty sycamore trailer park near downtown . she did not have many friends ; she was shy in school . one year , she tried out for a solo in the school holiday page ant . for the addition , she sang a flakey-o ' s jingle that was very popular at the time , but no one took her seriously . they all thought she was making a joke . she apologized and faded back into the bleachers . she truly loved that jingle . it spoke to her soul , it made her feel something . she recorded it off the radio and listened to it often , reminding and re playing it out at the picnic table on summer nights , when the rest of her family was asleep . but she never listened to it again after the solo trout , because it only brought back the sound of the other kid s laughing , of her teacher ' s scolding voice securing the class to take themselves seriously , or no one else would . and it made her feel ashamed . she eventually recorded over the tape with audit from a to special about orphan ed lion cubs . but sometimes , under the hungry sucking sounds of giant kitten drinking from baby bottles , she thought she could still hear the song . in th grade , she finally made some friends during the unknown creature dissection unit in science class . she was not squeamish , and her ability to identify and extract misshapen internal organs without clinching made her an attractive lab partner . everyone thought she was new in town because they had never noticed her before . she still has that effect on people . in the spring of that year , someone asked her to to the junior high dance . the team was ` ` heat death of the universe '' . the boys spent a lot of time licking the crepe paper decorations to dye their tongues bright colors and impress the girls . the girls were not impressed , but laughed anyway . sigrid ' s date tried to lick her hand to see if the dye would come off on her skin . this caused sigrid to feel a surge of strange tingling panic , and she fled to the bathroom for 30 minutes . her friends eventually found her and dragged her back into the gym . she danced with them for the rest of the night , hiding from the boys with the blue tongues . there were bountiful crops that year . some say this was not a coincidence . some say the junior high dance is a secret crop fertility ritual outlined in the town charter , but kept secret from the children who participate . when the dance was canceled in the following years , due to the crepe paper dye related poisoning incident , night vale experienced extreme drought and locus plagues . some say this , too , was not a coincidence . a quick bulletin board reminder : the reinstated junior high dance is coming up ! may all you young citizen make lush and plentiful memories , and have a cornucopia of fun . more citizen spotlight soon , but first , the weather . another secret confession . ah , what a treat ! this one comes from ironic local celebrity and recent dont food truck entrepreneur , lee margin . it says : ` ` there is a void . within that void a light . within that light , a hand . within that hand , a movement . within that movement , a potential . within that potential , everything that ever was . '' thank you lee , and of course , a happy 30 th birthday to you today ! citizen spotlight time . in high school , sigrid ' s left hand started to it ch below the pink finger . a small lump appeared which grew slowly over time . she became self-conscious about this and wore bulky sweatshirts with long sleeves pulled over her hands , which was luckily a fashionable look then . the nurse at the health clinic assured her that it was nothing to be concerned about , but it kept growing . eventually , it took the shape of what appeared to be a second , smaller pink finger . she was even able to wriggle it if she concentrated very hard . as you may know , the hetty sycamore trailer park was built on the dried-up shores of the old pesticide waste river , and sigrid ' s father felt there might be some connection between this and the extra finger . they decided to re locate . they moved into a two-story house by the train tracks , a fixer-upper that shook on its foundation twice a day when the train came through , and once or twice erratically every night when the secret night trains passed , with their name less and unshakable cargos . sigrid ' s parents began to fight often , never having the money to fix up the fixer-upper , and they both spent as much time as possible away from home . sigrid had a complicated relationship with her extra finger at this point , partially blaming it for the rift in her parents ' relationship . once , when sigrid was alone in the house , she heard something creeping up the stairs . she hummed the flakey-o ' s jingle til she could not hear it anymore , and then she started spending a lot more time away from home also . there was a small group of kid s who hung out around the train tracks at night , so she started hanging out with them to avoid going home . they liked to smoke cigarettes and light off fireworks and dare each other to look at the secret night trains , although none of them ever did , as they all knew that to look at one of those trains meant an instant and painful death . they would talk and gossip about kid s and teachers she d never heard of before , and she began to wonder if they even went to her school . when she was hanging out with them , she would often glance up at the dark windows of her own empty house just down the tracks and see movement behind the glass . or soft white eyes staring out . during one of these movements , while she looked at the house , all her friends disappeared and she found herself alone on the tracks . no sign of the teenager that had been there mere seconds before . she never saw those kid s again , but she often heard their voices in portable radius on the wind , and she spent her evenings wandering up and down the tracks , looking for them . at the end of senior year , the high school yearbook features fun awards for each student , voted on by the class . smartest girl and tall est boy and most likely to survive a mass extinction event , and best smile . every single student received a commemorative award , except for sigrid . it was not intentional or out of spite . everyone forgot that she existed . she was inexplicable absent during every school picture day throughout the years . never participated in any extracurricular activities , did not speak up in class , got average grades , and ate lunch alone . which some say contributed to her lack

ooh , i sorta took myself by surprise there , like i grew a suit or something ! the night vale economic development board , or nv-ec-dev-b for short and cumbersome , sent a press release at the closing bell of the night vale stock exchange . the bulletin said that future are down , way down . although the recent past is trading briskly . in response to declining levels of interests , nv-ec-dev-b plans to incentive consumer spending . at the start of tomorrow ' s business day , they ' ll launch an abject prompt campaign of xenophobia , branded as nationalism , branded as civic bride , branded as a 2008 f 150 ford truck with satellite radio , air conditioned seats , and a heavy-duty hit ch to haul away whatever it is you ' re trying to hide . so make plans this weekend to head out towards the used car lot with your hands in the air and your checkbook in your mouth , to meet with a sales person about financing option . you might be surprised by how few years of indentured servitude can you get you behind the wheel of a ford truck . you know what cars make me think of ? well , carlos . i guess , but everything makes me think of carlos . and his name is an ana gram of ` ` lo cars '' . he ' s out of town at erlenmeyer flask con this week , and i miss something fierce ! but what i was going to say is that the thought of buying a car reminds me of my niece let ! it ' s extraordinary to think that she ' ll be a teenager some day , getting her driver ' s permit , then her license , then her cross bow - going through all of these phases we all pass through . it ' s like there ' s a future attached to her already . inside sabina , there ' s a baby , and seated inside the baby there ' s the toddler . and within her are the blueprints for the girl . and soon , she ' ll be out here learning to play the star and considering vegetarian ism , then voting and buying lottery tickets . well , those are the same thing really . and i ' ll get to bear witness to this blooming life . some day , she might even decide to have a niece of her own . oh , ok . u m , something is in young cecil ' s eye over here . ooh ! hang tight , team , i ' m just go n na run out and grab a bunch of tissues from the supply closet to remove this bothersome ... ok , listeners , i must admit i ' m in a state of concerned agitation here . when i tried to open the door of the studio , the handle – came off in my hand and and and and when i went to insert it , i found that the hole was ( tamped ) full of soft hot tar , which can not be up to code . so now i find myself in a small , soundproof , air tight room with a doorless handle in my left hand and a handleless door before me . i ' m u h ... huh ... i'm- i ' m i ' m uncertain of just how to proceed , u h , i ca not imagine there ' s more than a few hours ' worth of oxygen in here , even if the studio ' s pott ed fera works double duty on converting the carbon dioxide . oh man and of course , i left my phone in my jeans in the other room , you know , after i changed into my professional radio ho sting united . i , ok , i need some time to assess the situation . i ' ll leave you to the weather . ok . ok , ok , alright calm down , calm down cecil , calm down , and you can beat this . be like the patient viper who does not strike until his prey is upon him . be like the praying man tis whose head is a guitar pick . keep your heart rate low and your focus steady , and good god , sit down , man . save your strength . breathe deep enough to get the air inside your brain and think . what would an uncle do ?

WTNV|Council Member Flynn, Part 1|15 September 2017|at least their heart ' s in the right place , i say , softly running my hand across a plastic take out container . welcome to night vale . in light of a string of armed robberies across night vale , the city council today called a press conference . they announced in unison that they are greatly disturbed by this crime wave , because it means that they ' ve had to put their vacation plans on hold . they really want to find a nice autumn spot to spend a month or two leaf-peeping , maybe kayaking if the sun ' s out . but no , now someone ' s running around town waving a gun and robbing stores . plus they have this new city council member , 16-year-old tamika lynn , who they ' re trying to train . and now with all the robberies , the transition of their new member is going much more slowly . ` ` also , '' they added , crime waves require so much paperwork and we ' re way behind ! you people . '' and here the council pointed their many fingers at the gathered citizens and press . ` ` you ! people ! '' yesterday ' s robbery of the ralph ' s only resulted in the theft of 72 dollars and an end cap of ch ex party mix . and while nobody was hurt , this was the 12 th robbery in the past week . week day shift manager at the ralph ' s , charlie bear , described the robber as a slight person with a high voice , wearing overalls and a black leather mask . the robber demanded whatever money charlie could grab , so he emptied his bank ma g of petty cash . but when he went to un lock the register , which had several hundred dollars , the robber had already left . city council , waving their many limbs in frustration , asked for calm . ` ` everything ' s fine , '' they said unconvincingly . ` ` it ' s fine ! '' they repeated , but the agitated crowd continued to scream and clutch their chests . ` ` please be chill , it ' s going to be fine ! '' the city council roared with their many discordant voices from one body . but for some reason , the crowd just was not feeling fine . and now a look at sports . the night vale high school wheelchair basketball team defeated the sand planes snakeguarders 60 to 58 last night in the pre-season state basketball tournament . this weekend they will take on the pine cliff liza rd monitor in the final . the liza rd monitor were the division champions last year , going un defeated in the regular season . but the night vale scorpions are being led this year by sophomore point card and my niece , janice palmer . janice led the division last year in assist..s , which is a statistic.. of some kind . i asked my brother in law steve carlsberg , who is an offensive coach on his daughter ' s team , what an assist was and he explained it , at length . but i forget exactly what he said . it-it-it-it made sense at the time , it ' s it ' s like a numerical measure of how helpful a person is , and janice led our division last year in helpfulness . so here ' s hoping that continues . good luck , scorpions ! go get'em , janice ! and now a word from our sponsors . today ' s show is brought to you by the new green market co-op , which just opened up on galloway road between patty ' s hardware and discount pas tries and one of those escape-the-room places , where you wake up in a bath tub chained to a pipe , and there ' s another person across the room also chained to a pipe , and in the middle of the room is a dead body with a gun and a cassette player ? yeah , i hear those are great fun . green market co-op owner tristan cortez said he opened the new store to provide a safe space for all your produce optic and food content transactions . too often , the people who eat food do not know where they are , or why they are , and they cry . they just sob in the middle of a store , afraid . well , the new green market co-op store front on galloway road wo not let that happen , cortez said . he said he will there every day to hold your hand , to nuzzle your neck with his nose , to whisper to you : ` ` do not be afraid '' , as he hands you an egg plant . oh , a quick aside , listeners . did you know that people in europe do not call them ` ` egg plants '' ? they call them ` ` aubergines '' . they also call arugula ` ` rocket '' , oranges ` ` dipdops '' , boston lecture ` ` dublin weeds '' , and plums ` ` sole grapes '' . anyway , cortez said building the new store was his daughter camilla ' s idea . she ' s an undergraduate studying business , and according to camilla ' s intensive research into the matter , she found having a physical location would be a huge boost in sales for a grocer store . so come on down to the brand new green market co-op . you ' re not safe anywhere but here . only minutes after their initial press conference , the city council called another press conference . there was no new news on the on going burglaries , they just wanted to say that it used to be different , this town , this whole area . ` ` na h you do not understand , '' they said . ` ` we are centuries old , '' the city council said . ` ` we were born in cases far beyond this desert , and we wandered until we found a place we could call home . we swam rivers , navigated forests , even climbed mountains . yes night vale , there are mountains . for we have not only seen them , but crest ed them , and we ended up here in night vale . we were many-voiced , but also many-bodied then , like all of you . we wore crowns made of soft meat , and taught ourselves magical spells , and used mind control on birds ! '' the council continued . ` ` we ran this town , and the people who settled here feared us ! they respected us , too . respected the blank out of us , like respect coming out the blank . blank ing respectful as blank . you know ? '' the city council coughed slightly and asked for a can of pamplemousse la croix from one of their aides , as they thumped thou their notes . ` ` but one day , our magic failed us , and our many bodies became one body , '' the council said , still in unison . ` ` it was deborah that missed up the spell . '' ` ` i did not ! '' came a single voice from the city council ' s body . ` ` did too ! '' came a different single voice . ` ` your handwriting is garage , germain ! '' said the first voice . ` ` stop it , both of you ! '' the council shouted in unison . they continued : ` ` and over the years , our legend , our mystique , has faded in the eyes of night vale . we were seen as fallible , as weak , as protectors of an old guard . and now as we witnessed this new face , this young tamika lynn , join our ranks we are reminded that the world moves on . the world is always growing older , and younger at the same time . '' the city council sighed . ` ` i guess what we ' re trying to say is millennials are ruining everything with their civic involvement and their lack of magic , and their disregard for wearing soft meats on their heads . so entitled , this general '' just then , tamika lynn appeared at the site of the podium , and there was a long silence . ` ` awkward ! '' the city council sang . tamika stepped forward to say she completed the paperwork to increase temporary funding for police overtime , in light of the recent wave of robberies . ` ` ra d , thanks ! '' said the council . ` ` do the young people still say ‘ ra d ' ? '' the council asked tamika who replied , ` ` i got ta get back to the mayor ' s office to ask about financial relief for robbery victims , '' and left . let ' s have a quick look at traffic . last week ' s storms flooded the old cemetery down in the low lands in old town night vale , and several human remains were washed out of their burial into route 32. it was not , like , skeleton or anything . i mean , there were a few skeleton and three or four really well preserved bodies , like skin and clothing and everything , but for the most part , it was just kind of a pulp mud that blocked the road . transportation department crews are still working on clearing the roadway , but it ' s super gross , so the workers are vomiting a lot . which is causing motorist on route 32 to vomit as well , which is really slowing things down . so avoid route 32 and take a instead . this has been traffic . listeners , only minutes after their last press conference , which was minutes after the first press conference , the city council called another press conference . this time with tamika lynn . they said , ` ` we ' re still trying to teach this young one about how to council a city , so we brought her up here to shadow us . she ' s a single-voiced , separately-bodied entity . yet , she still has not joined our form ! she walks and talks separate from us , and that is not how a city council should operate ! '' they said in unison , attempting to stare down the teenage council member . ` ` it goes against robert ' s rules of order , miss lynn , '' the city council hissed condescendingly . ` ` anyway , '' they said , ` ` we ' re having a third press conference , because there was another armed robbery just now , at the spike hammer coffee shop , over near the science district . the perpetrators stole the tip jar , which contained well over 17 dollars . they also stole a french press , but like , a really nice painless steel insulated one , not that tempered glass garage . '' the crowd murmured their panic , and the city council shouted , ` ` it ' s fine , try calming down for once , gee ! '' which had the opposite effect of calming . tamika then leaned over and said quietly to the council , ` ` they were calm . listen , we can fix this , this is not a problem . '' the city council said , ` ` you ' re a problem ! '' ` ` am not , '' tamika equipped . ` ` ouh huh ! '' as of this report , the ` ` am not '' versus ` ` ouh huh '' debate is continuing on the press podium at city hall . the gathered crowd of alarmed citizens has begun cawing at each other ' s faces and screaming things like , ` ` 17 dollars ! '' and ` ` it could have been us ! '' and ` ` a glass french press ? what are we , monsters ? '' more on this story as we get up dates . but next , let ' s have a look at today ' s weather .
WTNV|Council Member Flynn, Part 2|1 October 2017|paint a picture . it ' ll last longer . welcome to night vale . councilwoman tamika lynn announced this week that she got a new dog . it ' s her 17 th birthday in just ac couple of weeks , so her dad deangelo lynn said she could adopt a puppy . they went to the night vale animal shelter and discount tire shop . tamika thought about this sweetheart pit bull named rose , but worried about the need to walk and exercise such an active dog regularly . same with the blue heel er mix named hydrant . the shelter manager suggested a german heard named vincent , but deangelo said no daughter of his would have a german shepherd . he added that even the german shepherds with all of their hateful teeth and ignorant rage could not save us from the root uprising . tamika said she wanted a smaller dog anyway , and she settled on a pomerania , whom she has named lucky . she brought lucky to city hall . standing at op the front steps of the building tamika , wearing a long black coat adorned with chevrons , a sheriff ' s badge , infantry cords and little flanks of unhooked beef , held lucky proudly above her head , the way a person who just got a new car might hold it above their head . lucky is a light brown dust funny with hollow yellow eyes and a shrieking little laugh of a bark . ah , a real cutis ! happy early birthday , councilwoman lynn ! an update on the recent state of robberies and the related deaths of tristan and camilla cortez . the secret police have no new leeds toward suspects , but since the 8 pm curfew has gone into effect , there have been no robberies or major crimes of any kind . they have arrested six people in the last two days for being out after 8 pm . but those people were all angels , who were unaware of the curfew and were just walking around trying to ask people for ten bucks . now that acknowledging of angels is legal in night vale , the angels have been making a fortune , by just asking people for cash they do not actually need , because they ' re millionaires . but people are so happy to be able to acknowledge them that it ' s worth the few bucks the angels are asking for . and now sports . the night vale scorpions wheelchair basketball team lost the state pre-season tournament last weekend 81-72 to the pine cliff liza rd monitor . pine cliff forward helen king led all scores with 30 , and night vale point guard janice palmer set a state record in assist , with 22 . 22 assist in a game , that ' s empirically the most helpful game a night vale player has ever had . y'all , janice is my niece . it ' s a shame to lose , but it is only the pre-season . there is still a chance to win the division . unfortunately , i heard from janice ' s dad steve that janice is not handling the loss very well . steve said janice works really hard to get assist , because she wants to be a leader to help other people score the points , and even though she set a state record in assist , they still lost . steve said janice is working even harder on her passing skill and on running the high pick and roll , which is a basketball term that steve explained to me , and i knew i would not understand it , so i wrote down what steve said verbatim . let ' s see . here ' s what he said a ` ` high pick and roll '' was . quote : ` ` so the defender ' s guarding , right ? like this ! and then an offensive player comes over here like whose ! and then the ball handler goes like z am ! and then they go all and then , whom ! '' well . best of luck in the regular season , janice . michelle nguyen , owner of dark owl records , said that her store was robbed several weeks ago , during the height of the robbery spree . she remembers a person coming in wearing a mask , holding a gun , and smelling like fertilizes . they asked for gas , and michelle gave the thief a velvet sack full of item nr 4 bank-run gravel , which is her preferred currency these days . the robber then grabbed a stack of l p ' s from the new release section and left . michelle said she did not report the robbery because she did not really feel like it was a robbery . ` ` it ' s not like anyone listens to music anymore , '' she said . ` ` music is dead ! if they had stolen the sound of traffic and sirens and low-flying aircraft , i would have felt truly violated . but who ' s go n na miss keith urban on vinyl ? '' michelle added that everything is music and music is nothing . and then she closed the store for the day to go shout poems at passing trains with her friend maureen . tamika lynn and her new dog , lucky , have been making appearances across town at local business es assuring the owners that the town is safe . in addition to her dark coat with its many pins and stripes and medals and cow flesh , tamika has begun wearing leather riding boots , a tricorn and spike studded knuckle rings . she ' s really taken to the politics of her job , bringing along a camera crew to record these positive interactions with her constituents . it should be noted that there have never been elections for city council in our town ' s history . even tamika joined the council through coercion , not campaigning . perhaps this is not just a photo op , perhaps she really does care about the welling of each of her citizens . she might be my new favorite council member . frances donelson , owner of the antique mall , said she was so happy to see councilwoman lynn in her store . tamika shook her hand and told her everything would be ok , that she would not let anyone rob frances of her antique . ` ` i mean these antique are cursed as all get out . anyone tries to touch one of these things , they ' ll be living in a psychological terror-scape , '' donelson said , ` ` but it was nice of the young lady to say so . '' frances then sat by the window and thoughtfully watched the distant plane plass against the sky . lies el schmidt , who owns the auto-body shop near somerset and gray , said tamika stopped by her shop and told her all about how tamika ' s father worked at an automobile factory for decades , until he was laid off five years ago . he ' s since run his own den t repair service . lies el said tamika really wanted to impress on her the importance of independently run business es . ` ` i like tamika , '' schmidt said , ` ` and her little dog too ! he ate some of my socket french heads , which made him walk slow – ah , that made me laugh . he ' s a good dog ! '' well , i ' m certainly happy to see tamika winning over the people of night vale . she ' s done a lot for this town . but i know the curfew and travel stoppage has been a real strain . it ' s good to see her out there , keeping our spirits up . it ' s time once again for citizen spotlight . today ' s citizen spotlight is on megan allay . despite only being born four years ago , megan just celebrated her 17 th birthday this past spring , and will graduate night vale high school with honors next may . megan enjoys athletics and biology classes , and hopes some day to run her own clinic . she wants to go to a university and major in physical therapy next fall , but she ' s not sure where that will be just yet . megan was also on my niece janice ' s basketball team and was the team ' s leading scorer . but after the pre season tournament , she has decided to quit basketball to join tamika lynn ' s secret citizens ' secret crime patrol force . megan never had an inclination toward law enforcement , but she ' s not she can afford college . even if she gets a scholarship , she says there are still books , forms , food , beer , pet tarantulas , and clothes to buy . her parents tuck and herself ca not pay for any of that , so she is taking on part time work patrolling the streets after curfew . the team will miss you , megan , but our streets are safer with you out there . this has been citizen spotlight . a new report from the mayor ' s office shows a significant drop in crime the past two weeks , since tamika lynn took over the secret police . councilwoman gave credit to deputy sheriff sam , the entire police force including the secret police , double secret police , obvious police and dog police , and even the citizen patrol force for their extra efforts . also tamika said the blooded buildings everyone helped paint look gorgeous and intimidating . but it ' s not all good news . the mayor ' s report shows a significant increase in traffic accidents , as the police are stretched so thin . also , since most of the city ' s resources are focused on stopping armed robberies of business es , there have been unrepaired water main breakages , damaged street signs , and understaffed municipal offices . with few available funds and zero economic activity after 8 pm , city-run departments like the hall of public records , the public library , and the abandoned mine shaft outside of town , sit empty most days . the mayor ' s office expressed concern in the deterioration of these buildings for lack of huge , not to mention the inconvenience their closure pose . ` ` councilwoman lynn is a tough and decided leader , but how far must we push ourselves away from comfort in order to preserve safety ? '' mayor cardinal said . ` ` our infrastructure is at risk of erosion if we continue to ignore everything , except law and order . our emotional health is at risk if we close ourselves off . '' and here the mayor paused to take a bite of a whole fresh butter nut square . or , as the europeans call it , a ` ` y am balloon '' . she continued with her mouth full : ` ` i ask councilwoman lynn to call back the rest of the city council from wherever they are so we can hold an emergency meeting to explore better solutions toward reducing crime . '' listeners , i agree with the mayor . while i love that there have been no robberies or deaths or ar sons in the past several weeks , i would also like to point out that a culprit has yet to surface . the police , under the control of tamika lynn , do not even have a suspect . whoever has done this has certainly been stifled by the strict city ordinances , but how long must we continue hiding in our homes every evening ? if the person who has committed these crimes is still in this city , they will certainly start robbing , and maybe even killing once again . tamika refused the mayor ' s request , saying that the other city council members do not do well under stress , and that they ' ve never been of any help in situations like this . tamika continued oh ! oh , listeners , i – i ' m sorry to break into my own story but i am getting reports that deputy sheriff sam and their secret police are in a stand off in the tepid sands housing development at the intersect ion of tillman boulevard and dubois avenue . shots have been fired , u h i ' m going to find out and report further what is happening . but first , let me take you to the weather . the good news is that all of the police officers in this afternoon ' s fracas are uninjured . the bad news is that two young women were severely wounded by a librarian . a librarian , in their own home ! the girls , lisa robertson , 18 , and her younger sister maria , 15 , were at home quietly reading their new copies of patrick lockwood ' s 2017 spectacular craft ed memoir ` ` priest daddy '' , when they heard a window shatter . a librarian had smelled the humorous and deft poetic of lockwood ' s implacable writing and broke in to devour the readers of this sharp and emotional story of religion , family , and toxic masculinity . when the librarian found the two sisters , it attacked . it was not the robertson sisters ' first fight against a librarian . they , along with councilwoman tamika lynn , survived the summer reading program at the night vale public library three years ago . they nearly did not survive today ' s attack . it was thanks to sheriff sam ' s quick response that police were able to stop the librarian from further damage . unfortunately , the librarian , whose name was dan mcdowell , escaped police custody and is still on the loose . tamika lynn , on behalf of the city council , still away on vacation until this whole thing blows over , expressed sadness for her injured friends and fellow bibliophiles lisa and maria . the mayor doubled down on her earlier statements and blamed this tragic attack on a city-wide failure to pay for upkeep of municipal buildings . ` ` there was no one there to lock the librarian ' cases , to feed them regularly , '' the mayor said . ` ` as a city , it is our responsibility to protect life , yes , but also protect a life worth living . '' councilwoman lynn thanked the mayor for her comments , but then promptly called for a closing of the port authority . no ships in or out of town . night vale has no body of water to speak of , but the occasional freight er or cruise ship does arrive . lynn also moved curfew to 6 pm and said no one is allowed within 100 feet of the library , or any bookstore , for that matter . ` ` these days my father only talks about the root uprising , '' lynn said . ` ` for a long time , i thought he was just being weird . there ' s no root uprising ! i have seen advanced robotics , and those things can barely walk . even my phone struggles to load a basic google image search for ` ` gaping sloths '' . but what if there were roots we do not know about ? metaphorical roots . what if the things we can not see , can not predict ? why not be prepared to protect ourselves against –any- enemy ? '' she added her regret that people would not have access to books anymore , but added that maybe , the city should get everyone a nook . ` ` is nook still a thing ? '' lynn added . ` ` whatever . mayor cardinal , let ' s have the city buy everyone an reader . '' lynn concluded her speech with : ` ` i know curfew is early , but curfew does not apply to law enforcement . you ' re all welcome to join my new vigilante citizen squad . help us beat the hell out of crime after dark ! '' lucky laughed , or barked , it was unclear which , and they both left , tamika ' s spurs rattinglina dn long cape swishing . the mayor has appealed to the public for support , stating that once we have a full coroner ' s report on the bodies of tristan and camilla cortez , we can engage i un a true investigation , rather than martial law . but given tamika ' s success in eradication the robberies , most people still trust her ability to stop librarian . i mean , rattling those things is her specially . there ' s no one better . i ' m not really afraid of robbers who target business es , i mean , who ' s go n na hold up a radio station ? or a science lab , where my husband works ? but if librarian start believing they can wander anywhere , attack anyone reading any old book by one of america ' s foremost poets or word smiths , then they could attack me , or carlos . or steve , or abby , or janice . i-i know it seems like i ' m scared , but i ' m not . like you , i ' m just – wary . wary of lurking disaster . plus there ' s so much to keep me entertained at home after curfew . it ' s not like the 1990 ' s when the only technology we had was putting on politically satirical puppet shows using rocks with cartoon faces drawn on them . it ' s actually enjoyable to turn in early each night . i ' ve got an box , a or helmet , some vegetation that is totally legal , and susan gilman ' s ho go password , which steve gripped for me . it ' s great ! i do not know how long we ca keep this up , but for now , i just want to feel safe . stay tuned next for wait , hold on . oh i just received a fax that the coroner ' s report has been completed , night vale and huh . oh wo w ! ooh , you ' re not going to like this ! you know what , let ' s save it . it ' s almost dark , night vale , curfew is almost upon us . this will pass as all things will pass . we ' re in good hands in tamika ' s hands . if there ' s anyone who knows how to protect us from librarian , she does . stay tuned next for the sound of two men huddled up in bed watching the new season of insecure . and good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : pull this lever . do not worry , you will never know the result .
WTNV|Council Member Flynn, Part 3|15 October 2017|good hidden recording devices make good neighbors . welcome to night vale . council member tamika lynn announced today that she ' s pretty comfortable doing this whole city council thing , now that night vale is completely crime free . she announced this standing at op an onya pyramid , waving a golden scepter . mayor dana cardinal responded that while crime is clearly down , budget for the new fiscal year have not been completed , and night vale is showing a marked financial loss this quarter , due in large part to strict evening curfews . she announced this silently into her journal , which she plans to publish as a scathing memoir some day . sheriff sam announced that the increased number of secret police officers has really had a positive impact on crime , but most of the police force now is volunteer or underpaid , and grossly unqualified . it ' s basically a bunch of random citizens with makeshift weapons carved out of tree branches or fashioned from broken blade-based kitchen appliances . the sheriff noted that management of council member lynn ' s citizen patrols has greatly impeded the capture of both the aerial robber and the escaped librarian . sheriff sam quietly grumbled this into their bathroom mirror before finally putting on make up and facing their day . council member lynn later said she received a postcard from the rest of city council , who has been vacation ing in milstigan the past month . on the front of the postcard was a serene lake nest led among tall pin es and speckled with hearings and fishing boats . above the lake were eight black hawk helicopter , dangling each of the letters of the state name : m-i-b-s-t-i-c-a-n. on the back , the city council had written : ` ` saw an article that night vale has the lowest crime rate . guess you ' re doing fine without us and we do not need to come back . '' the postcard continued : ` ` we learned how to kayak and we bought a professional grade dslr and learned to tie sailing knots . michel is awe some ! maybe we wo not ever come back . maybe we are not wanted . '' council member lynn said she wrote them back a postcard which she tap ed to a giant scorpion that read : ` ` yeah , i ' ve got this under control . happy apple picking . '' night vale coroner lorelei avare issued her report today on the topsy of the two bodies found at the green market co-op , which burned down last month in an apparent robbery-arson . these bodies are believed to be those of green market owner tristan cortez and his daughter camilla , a business student at night vale community college . avare , however , said that without dental records for the cortez es , she ca not be certain that these bodies are theirs . the bodies had almost no burns on them , despite being found in a building leveled by fire . there were also no gunshot wounds . avare said , ` ` these two bodies were wearing 19 th century formal attire and had apparently been pecked to death by birds . '' she added she had not ruled out that birds could have committed robberies , nor that the cortez family had an anachronistic fashion sense . avare added with a grin that she ' s also gotten a few bodies that had been mostly devoured by the escaped librarian . she said it ' s fascinating that librarian tend to eat only bones and ligaments , and not flesh or skin . so most of these corpses looked like rumpled soft leather sacks , which makes them much easier to store . avare has so much more free space in her office now and has added a tetherball pole . and now sports . tonight , the night vale high school scorpions take on division rival red me sa ant carpenters in variety wheelchair basketball . this afternoon , there will be a pe p rally led by team captain janice palmer . also she ' s my niece . the team captain is my niece . councilwoman tamika lynn will also deliver a speech at the pe p rally about the importance of tearworn and fighting crime with sports . also , the importance of books . ` ` did you know there are books about sports ? '' is the title of lynn ' s speech . lynn also requested , for reasons having to do with public safety , that the pe p rally be moved away from the high school to the old night vale armory , and that every person there stand exactly two feet apart and bring some type of shield and/or sharp object that could be used to fe nd off robbers or librarian . the pe p rally is at noon . go get'em , janice ! listeners , mayor cardinal and her director of emergency press conferences , pamela mitchell , have called an emergency press conference to denounce the city council ' s poor efforts to sustain the integrity and stability of night vale . mayor cardinal dismissed the city council ' s – essentially tamika lynn ' s – curfew as virtually meaningless , now that more than half of the population is on the citizen patrol force . ` ` we basically have a town of municipal ly approved armed vigilantes walking around at all hours of the night . '' mitchell second ed the mayor ' s point by adding : ` ` why do i video myself sleeping ? what am i hoping to discover ? what secrets does my body whisper when i am unconscious ? '' also , the president of the night vale school board , the giant glowing cloud who drops dead animals , made an impassioned speech in support of the mayor via mind control . the entire crowd chant ed : ` ` all hail the mighty cloud who wants the lowly city council to pass a budget that favors increased spending on education ! we grovel before the almighty cloud ! how hard can it be to make a human budget ? all hail ! '' they repeated . the mayor said she ' s received many letters from people claiming they have lost their jobs as waiters , cab drivers , theatre managers and costume superheroes because of the strict curfews . night vale community host cecil palmer also announced today , live on his radio show , right now , that the curfew has been super productive for his to watching , as he has already burned through every ho and showtime series . plus all of ` ` difficult people '' on hull , which features his second favorite actor , james urbanity . my favorite is , of course , lee margin – may his name ring forever in eternity . palmer added , at this very second , that while he ' s caught up on a lot of good television and is very excited for the new season of the documentary series ` ` stranger things '' , he and his husband are getting a little stir crazy . there are only so many games of strip un o a couple can play before they just wan na go out for a nice dinner and maybe a romantic stroll in the park . councilwoman lynn was not available for comment , although a sign above her locked office door said : ` ` quiet , reading a book on how to do financial spreadsheets '' . listeners , i mentioned earlier my niece janice and how proud i am of her for captain ing her school ' s basketball team . but i ' m also a bit worried about her too . she looks perpetually exhausted . in the pre season tournament , she led all players in assist . she did everything she could to win games , but they just could not quite do it . her statistics bear this out , but still she ' s taken on so much responsibility for the team ' s losses . her dad and team assistant coach , steve carlsberg , says janice has increased her practice time to increase her fantastic passing skill , hoping to at least double the number of assist she gets . but steve says that despite her better skill and more focused demeanour during practice , her team mates just are not hitting their shots when she passes to them . she throws them the ball shouting : ` ` shoot it ! you ' re open , julie ! '' but they miss over and over , even the ones named julie . steve is trying to convince her to work more on her defense and shooting , that assist are not everything . but janice got frustrated with this and called steve selfish . ` ` assist are the most un selfish thing , steve carlsberg ! '' she shouted before leaving the gym to po ut by her lock er earlier this morning . ` ` maybe i should just quit , '' steve heard her mumble . you know , i ' m sure it ' s just a teenager fighting with her step dad , and she ' ll be all ready to go for today ' s pe p rally . which is set to start in a few minutes . i ' ll check in with her later tonight to make sure she ' s doing ok . councilwoman tamika lynn has arrived early for today ' s pe p rally to deliver a brief statement about vigilance , self-preservation , and keeping our town crime free . even though there ' s a librarian on the loose , and our sheriff has yet to catch the aerial robber , our streets are super safe , '' lynn said . ` ` i read a book this morning about how low crime rates are excellent for local economies . the book is ‘ lonesome dove ' by larry mcmurtry , in case you ' re interested . '' ` ` look around you , '' she continued , ` ` no one here is being cried upon , because we are protecting each other . we are watchful and observant . '' ` ` as my father once warned , '' tamika lynn said , ` ` beware the root uprising ! beware the machines that will bring us down ! that ' s what he always told me before bed , and we must heed this words , night vale . at any moment , a great enemy could be upon us . '' tamika then said : ` ` hey , it ' s after 12. are not we supposed to start this pe p rally ? i ' m in the middle of gr eg harvey ' s literary masterpiece and winner of the man book er price , ‘ microsoft expel for duties ' , so let ' s make this quick . i ' m really into that book , '' she concluded . but the crowd murmured , confused and agitated . the captain of the team was not there . and as they looked for the pe p rally ' s leader , the bearer of the basketball torch , my niece , my only niece – the stage began to shake , the earth began to split , and smoke and dust are currently filling the night vale armory in choking plumes . oh my god , night vale , where ' s janice ? where is my niece ? listen to today ' s weather while i find out where she is . the rest of the city council has returned to night vale . they burrow ed through the earth and up through the floor of the armory where the pe p rally was being held . they apologized for the dramatic and destructive entrance , but their flight out was really turbulent and there was no meal service . so they thought they d take the slower , but more comfortable route home . the multi-limbed , multi-voiced , single-bodied entity of the city council was wearing a shirt that said : ` ` michigan – america ' s sexiest forests '' , featuring little cartoon te es with ribbed ab s and bubble butts . the city council then presented two people whose hands were bound with ropes , tied off tight with perfect bow line nuts . it was tristan cortez and his daughter , camilla . the city council said they found the cortez es while rock climbing . according to the city council , camilla had devised an insurance sca m , which tristan set up by committing a series of small armed robberies around night vale , to make the robbery and the subsequent arson of their new store more believable . they stole two bodies from the old cemetery , which flooded last month , and laid those in the burned-out husk of their former market to fake their deaths . camilla created a fake id for a sister she did not have , named axilla , who lived in mistrigen , where they planned to live out life bird watching and parasailing in the paradise of america ' s most hand shaped state . the city council laid out this entire plot , as they presented sheriff sam with the two fraudsters . then the city council turned to their newest member , tamika lynn and said , ` ` we also completed the new city budget , '' as they dropped a six-inch high stack of papers , like it was a mi c at a poetry slam . and even better , listeners : janice finally arrived . we found her ! after the city council made their speech , the basketball team captain stepped to the mi c and said she was running late today because she was practicing so hard to be a better pass er , to have more assist , to be empirically the best team mate that the league record books have ever seen . but then , just this morning after a fight with her step dad , she realized she was wrong . ` ` you ca not measure leadership , '' janice said . ` ` i ' ve been so worried about that one number , that one datum that seems so helpless . but the act of pursuing that number is in itself selfish . '' janice said , ` ` i ca not do this all on my own . i ca not expect everyone else to score thinking i ' m being helpful . each one of us has a different skill set , and as your captain , i want you to be great at scoring , defense , resounding , whistling , and the occasional he x – the five pillars of sound basketball . so let ' s get out there and beat red me sa ! '' the crowd cheered and joined together to sing the night vale school song , ` ` you walk with me , you walk alone under an indifferent dust-filled sky '' . tamika then spoke . she stood before her fellow citizens , her constituents , and said : ` ` i want the best for all of us , i really do . i ' m new at this , and the one thing i know how to do well , really well , is fight , and i want that for everyone . also read , i ' m awe some at reading . i want that for you too . government jobs are weird because you ca not really fight a lot of crime . you mostly do paperwork and have meetings and scan retina . government is evasive and stupid and slow , and it ' s because there are so many people it has to account for . and i realize it takes lots of time and lots of people to change . i just want this to change . i want us to feel safe . i also want to finish this amazing novel about microsoft expel , it is so compelling . '' at the behest of tamika lynn , the city council voted unanimously to lift the town-wide curfew . and restaurant have already began to re open , as well as theaters , public park s , clothing stores and blood stone circle repair shops . even the library has reopened with plans to renovate the security gates and triple barred cases that keep the librarian safely away from society . and with the return of library activities , escaped librarian dan mcdowell even returned to his former job , promising not to eat anyone else , unless they were trying to check out a book . the city council also voted to keep all the city buildings painted blood red , because quote , ` ` that ' s intimidating af . '' and then they tried to vote to change the town motto to ` ` night vale – intimidating af '' . but it lost by a single deciding vote , which belonged to tamika , who said we should pace ourselves . she then quoted jean-jacques rousseau : ` ` patience is bitter , but s its fruit is mad sweet , like a sole grape . '' sheriff sam praised the city council for capturing these criminals . mayor cardinal praised the city council , too , but she added praise specifically for tamika lynn . mayor cardinal said , ` ` i ' m proud of you , councilwoman lynn . i did not agree with your tactics , but i think your heart is in the right place . it will take time , but we can do this . '' tamika accepted the mayor ' s kind words and a comforting embrace , and then returned to her office to finish her novel about spreadsheets . night vale , janice and tamika are growing up before our eyes , and i could not be proud er of either . but more importantly , i could not be more excited to get out of the house ! carlos and i are headed straight to dinner at the shallow grave , and then going dancing at that new club , numb , which opened up mere minutes after the curfew was lifted . stay tuned next to the sound of two men putting on just the most vicious outfits . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : we are all ( an elite few ) in this ( a secret underground emergency bunker ) together ( on our own without public knowledge ) .

'' oh let ' s see ! well this is actually quite entertaining , there are clues and maps and , is that an acrostic ? hugh : it is an acrostic , very good mr palmer ! it ' s a clue to where the case was buried . now from 1967 to 1973 , hiram walker distilled spirits t ba canadian club ran a contest where they hid 21 cases of canadian club whiskey throughout the world , from the dense st alleys of makarka to the skyscrapers of manhattan , the cable car tracks in san francisco , on cobblestones streets in london , under 30 feet of water on the great barrier reef . they ran ad s with clues about how to find them , and find them the people of the world did ! every single case was recovered . cecil : that ' s remarkable . hugh : mr palmer . we hid a case under the ice caps of the north pole , and people found it . we dropped one on mount everest.. cecil : mountains . so why do you think people wanted to find them so badly ? hugh : as far as we can tell , it has to do with people ' s desire to have alcohol . ironically , it sank the contest . people were not buying canadian club . they figured that it was way cheaper and more fun to get a yacht and sail to the cabman islands and snorkel under the security fences of the international monetary fund and then you know like , remove a case from the international monetary fund ' s mo m ' s poolside refrigerator , and that ' s exactly what happened to case number 17. so sales plummeted , but later , hiram walker merged with ( – ) , which was acquired by batard consternation brands , which is now an acquisition of our little te ch start up , ceremony ! cecil : now excuse me but what does ceremony do ? hugh : we dreamfluence ! cecil : ... got it . hugh : it turns out there ' s one further case of canadian club . it ' s been hidden for over 40 years . right here in night vale ! here ' s the ad . this is the november 1973 issue of play boy . go on , read it . cecil : u m , ` ` on august 30 , we hid a case of canadian club in night vale . here ' s how to find it . '' but , mr jack man , the rest of the ad is blank . hugh : we at ceremony after some internal discussion , believe that might be why the case was never found . there seems to have been some kind of event at the printers that month . fr an lebowitz ' s interview with progressive rock band yes keyboard ist rick wake man is perfectly fine for its first 37 pages , but then devolves into a series of umlauts . little anne fanny , generally a lighthearted and adorable misogynistic comic strip , was just panel after panel of ... cecil : ..umlauts . hugh : and mr palmer , look at the pectoral on men ' s golf parts . cecil : aaaagh ... hugh . yeah . cecil : ooooooooh . hugh : i know , we ' re not really sure what happened there . further , you ' ll see that every cartoon has the same punchline . cecil : oh yeah . u h , here ' s a bride on her wedding day and her mother is telling her ... ` ` it ' s under cecil ' s desk '' ? hugh : same punchline is on page 33 with the desert island , and page 74 here with the cowboys at the saloon . both in unison : ` ` it ' s under cecil ' s desk '' ! cecil : that is so odd ! so mr jack man , why does ceremony want to find his case of liquor ? hugh : we thought it would be.. fun . can i look under your desk ? cecil : why ? hugh : the case is under your desk . cecil : yeah , but this desk was not even here in 1973. hugh : so you ' re telling us - me - no ? cecil : well i ' m telling you to ask station management . hugh : oh , i will ! cecil : iii mean they ' ll make you fill out a form , and they can also create fire with their minds . also they ' ve eaten people before for way less . hey gustave ? gustave , come in here and show hugh what station management did to your eye . hugh : oh my ! cecil : oh god hugh : that is disgusting . cecil : ugh , it ' s getting wor- ok , that ' s enough gustave . hugh : oh . i am prepared . i ' m familiar with your station and management and not afraid of them . eunice , lily , agatha , de marcus and chad , old friends of mine . cecil : who ? hugh : have you never learned the names of your supervisors , mr palmer ? you need a team building retreat . i ' ll be back . you have not seen the last of me . cecil : yeah well you are not even the real hugh jack man ! i do not trust that man . i need to figure out what to do next . we ' ll be back after this . life is meaningless . there are no guiding principles , nor rewards , nor punishments for how to live . just flashes of pain or joy , which are only neurotic messages , not actual experiences . even pondering why we exist is a riderless journey . so consciousness is a means to no end . the sheriff ' s secret police would like to acknowledge that hearing this will ruin your day . however , they are further authorized to announce that nothing we have heard about nature describes a process that occurs without purpose . we can point to a fish ' s f in and understand what function it serves . a monkey ' s fur , a starwise ' s many arms . the corns in your uncle simon ' s branch beard that explode outward as stabbing bristled whenever uncle simon experiences fear . they all serve a purpose . so it ' s possible that consciousness developed for a reason larger than consciousness itself can conceive of . the function of your mind is literally beyond comprehension . which means that awareness , pursued to its limits , only makes you aware of your helpless ness . you are without power in this life . except when you purchase items by using – money . this has been brought to you by – money . we are back and – i ' m in a jam . i mean i do not trust this ` ` hugh jack man '' nor his company . i mean after what strexcorp did to our town , i ' m a bit wary of any business conglomerate . although ceremony does seem different , friendliest . but what is this thing with looking under my desk ? i ' m not sure i should even look under my desk , i mean what if i find it ? what if i do not find it ? every time i ' v hidden under my desk , i ' ve closed my eyes and for good reason ! i ' m so distracted i lost my notes and now i do not even know what the news was supposed to be ! and gustave went to go by some cotton balls and anti-bacterial spray for his missing eye . um.. well , i mean honestly i ' ve never really looked at any of these magazines before . i mean , play boy was for other boys and girls . u h , interesting . listeners , did you know that play boy magazine has a bunch of pictures of women across various careers with in-depth profile on their lives ? i did not know this . yeah there ' s a whole pectoral on this issue of all the women who have ever played james bond , in full costumes ! oh my god , look at these smart taxes and pistols and one of them ' s on a motorcycle ! in the middle of a magazine , there ' s even a flout photo of a woman in overalls and a hard hat , leading a volunteer construction crew who ' s building houses in a hurricane-ravaged nova scotia . oh , and on the other side of the flout , there ' s a playmate questionnaire . let ' s see , her turnoffs include ` ` impatient people and tick bites '' . you know , i agree with that . and her turn-ons include ` ` groove people , good food , overwhelming feelings of dread , chanting , and all hail the glow cloud '' . all hail the glow cloud ! yes ! u h , the playmate ' s name is missy wilks . missy wilks ? ! could that be the missy wilks who lives over on kestrel street here in night vale ? i mean , they do have similar eyes and tendrils . i wonder if it ' s possible that she knows where the case of canadian club is ? well let ' s see . m-i-s-s-y-w-i-l-k-s. missy : hello ? cecil : hello , is this missy wilks ? this is cecil palmer from the radio station . it ' s a little hard to explain why i ' m calling but - missy : have you looked under your desk ? cecil : oh , not yet . should i ? i mean i kind of do not want to . missy : cecil . i ' ve been waiting for this phonecall for over 40 years . you must look under your desk . the future of night vale depends on it . cecil : have you been doing anything else ? missy : pardon ? cecil : 40 years . missy : well , no not really . raised a family . shot a guy once . but you ' re stabling , cecil . cecil : i ' m not stabling ! bu-but you know , we really should get to today ' s weather . cecil : and we ' re back . missy : have you looked under the de - cecil : no , i ' ve not looked under my desk ! missy : come – on - , cecil ! cecil : wait , why does mr jack man want this so badly ? missy : ugh ! it ' s why they put cases everywhere on the planet ! they knew that leaving an item in place long enough allows it to absorb the spirit of the area . that case is now in fused with the soul of night vale . no one actually recovered those other cases . ceremony recovered them after they bought all the other parent companies of canadian club . they ' re going to send out one of their corporate prize contestants sweepstakes buzz marketing street tea ms to dreamfluence anyone who stands in their way . if ceremony finds it before you do , they will drink night vale ' s soul , the same way they ' ve drunk the soul of all the other cities ! cecil : wait , that makes no sense ! they ' ve recovered a bunch of these across the world . are you saying that manhattan , san francisco , london , the great barrier reef and the cabman island do not have souls anymore ? missy : cecil . cecil : oh my god , you ' re right . ok then , alright , i ' m going to look . i am looking under my desk . and i am findiiing.. nothing . i , there ' s nothing under here ! missy : mm ? cecil : wait , wait wait wait wait wait wait oh , oh , oh , oh , oh wait put – a pushkin ! a red one ! and tit ' s holding an envelope to the underside of the desk ! missy : is it manila ? cecil : yes ! and it ' s addressed to me . there ' s a letter inside . it ' s written on papers and you can tell it ' s very old because it ' s written in cursive . it says : ` ` dear cecil how are you ? we are fine . we ' re sorry we did not write earlier , but we were learning our destinies . we had to un learn so many things . small steps , then larger ones , then larger until we were almost flying , but not quite flying because we had to un learn our expectations and then un learn our limitations , so we gave up on flying . because that turns out not to work regardless of your expectations and no matter what you un learn . so we re learned what we needed to . we ' ve re learned so many essential things , cecil , about work and love and complaining about work and love and – oh ! and we took the case of boone ! if you wan na find us , you ' ll know us by our sign . '' and then it ' s signed with a smear of foam . no wait , this is not just any foam it ' s – hold on ! cappuccino ! oh my goodness , i have to tell ms wilks that missy : i ' m still here . cecil : oh ! miss wilks ! i know where the case of canadian club is ! missy : where ? cecil : it ' s in the cave lands outside of town . it ' s been taken by the baristas ! missy : cecil ! this is the worst possible news ! the baristas are no match for buzz marketing street tea ms . the baristas are gentle people , soft of spirit and jolly of countenance , whose dreams are only influenced by the purest of the loves , not crowd source manipulations . the baristas are rosy-cheeked and innocent ! they gamble like lambs , cecil ! you ' ve got to warn them ! cecil : ok , i will , i will . thank you , miss wilks ! listeners , this is terrible , iii do not know what to do ! i do not like warning people about things , i mean warnings lead to consequences and we all know how much i avoid consequences . in fact , there ' s only one way to be thoroughly insulated from consequence and – that ' s to accumulate enough money . but i do not have any money . as station management recently switched their pay roll protocol from cash to twitter followers and groups for local spas , so i ' m kin da screwed . think , cecil , think . think think think think think . stay tuned next to the sounds of chewing amplified to the threshold of pain . good night , night vale , good night ! today ' s proverb : people always say ` ` before i die '' , as if they have not already begun the process .
WTNV|"eGemony, Part 2: ""The Cavelands"""|15 November 2017|time is irrelevant and imaginary . and yet , somehow it seems we are out of it . welcome to night vale . listeners , i have just returned from an odyssey . as you know , a case of canadian club whiskey was hidden in night vale over 40 years ago as part of a contest . and now , e-gemonee ... edge-meny , edge-meny , edgem- eedgemon- e- that te ch start up wants it back , so they can drink it and thus drink the soul of night vale . it turns out that the alcohol was spirited away by – oh , ahahah , spirited , that ' s a good one , cecil ... by baristas . i knew i had to warn them before the corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street tea ms located them . but that would mean going to a place from which no one has ever returned : the remote cavelands of the baristas , deep under the earth , where ( eritrean pourover ) drops gently from stalagmites and latte foam rivers fro th and bubble in cool stone cracks . we ' re all pretty sure the cavelands are under that crate behind the ace hardware , but no one goes down there because of the stench of express and the shilling sounds of car ly simon ' s greatest hits cd . the underground society of the baristas is an insular one , and no outsider has met their king . did you know that baristas have a king ? i mean i did not , but my niece janice knows all about which professions have monarchs and which like mm , ride sharing services , only have serpent wearing crowns . janice still has her barista costume from last year ' s careers parade . so in order to investigate the cavelands , i croaked myself carefully in the necessary animal skins , as janice directed , and slung over my shoulders the ceremonial spike coffee hammer and the sweat er vest with the correct number of arm holes . janice and i took a quick online course in latte art . janice was great at it . she made a photorealistic aspledium nidus fera , and i u h , i made a , rock of some kind . janice said she knew exactly how to finish my disguise , and she was right . i regarded myself in the ace hardware window , and i knew i was meant for that boldest , unruliest , most outlaw of mustaches : the rolly fingers ! the final touch of a true barista . rolly fingers was the most famous king in barista history , and now every barista grows a long thick mustache that swirls at the ends , just like the former king rolly . from these curls , baristas often hang sweetness and spoons for customer service . i flexed all my facial muscles tight , and within minutes , i had finesse my new thick mustache into lovely coils . it was sunset , the time when all the baristas return to the ace hardware parking lot , from their day labor jobs , or as they call them , ` ` gig s '' throughout greater night vale . my plan was to simply blend among them . blend oh my god blend , oh cecil you ' ve done it again . and so one by one , i smiled and waved at them , and we teased each other with sprays of hot steam , as is the way of baristas at the end of a long day . there were 10 of us , then 15 , then perhaps 20 , then 30 , then 40 , then 100 baristas . baristas as far as the eye can see . so many baristas , all laughing and scald ing each other with joviality . then a very tall barista , whose animal pelts were dusted in silver , looked at me with suspicion . i put her mind at ease by calling out one of their familiar jokes . ` ` your mother is so tasteless , she orders her eggs ristretto ! '' i cried . the barista ' s hardened face softened into a laugh and she called out : ` ` time to ride ! '' our seeds made quick work of the steep mile and a half descent below ace hardware . i could hear the faint echoes of no rah jones , as we passed cuneiform style sketches of french presses on the rocky walls . once we were in the cases , by the lights of torches dipped in ( pinch ) , the baristas ambled to their bed rolls , their knapsacks , their ( bundles ) , and all around the cave , i could see them un wrapping and dusting off and ( - ) their instruments . i saw harmonious , violins , ocarinas , banjoes , mouth harps , mouth piano , mouth banjoes , ( lip scissors ) , and those who had nothing to play brought out pots and pans to keep time . and we began – to sing . ` ` i ' m dreaming of someone whose love is so swee-ee-eet , like ( – ) ( cronut ) , 4000 fee-ee-eet , oh my perfect love gives me endless bli-i-iss , never wants the wife password without puur-chaa-a-ase i said he never asked for that wiki password without a puur-chaa-aase . '' and then , without warning , one of the baristas made a gesture and the rest fell silent . they were all looking at me , listeners . ` ` he does not know our an them ! '' she said . ` ` no , i totally do , '' i said . ` ` i mean , i was definitely singing ... something . '' the baristas closed in on me . ` ` do not talk to me til i ' ve had my coffee ! ami rite ? '' i pleaded . from the back , i heard a quiet but authoritative snarl . ` ` it ' s cecil ! '' the baristas parted , all of them , and in the silence , i heard the shuffling of leather shoes , and i was face to face with the king of the baristas . listeners , we are all made up of goodness and not-so-goodness . we have conflicting impulses and we struggle to do right . we care to a lesser or greater extent whether our actions are moral , and if they will strike other people as immoral . this is true for all of us , you and me . corporal and otherwise . everyone . except the king of baristas . when i saw him , i knew immediately he had never once hesitated to do right . how did i know this ? maybe it was his beard , as his beard seemed kind . or it was the way his eyes , his purple eyes crinkled with empathy . or it was who the light glint ed off his horns . in any case , listeners , he reminded me a little of a buffalo . and it ' s hard not to trust a buffalo . ` ` cecil , '' he said . ` ` we have been waiting for you . and by we i do not mean the royal we , as we do not believe in that , and i did not mean the royal we that second time either . all of us have been waiting for you , and not one of us believes in the royal we . and i love your mustache so oo much ! '' the king added in a baby voice as he pinched my cheek . i explained that i came to the cavelands for the boone . he said , ` ` we ' ll talk about that . but first , we need to talk about something more important . your new sponsor . '' i said , ` ` our sponsor , you mean money ? did you know it ' s available in twenties now ? '' he said : ` ` do not speak to us of the attractiveness of money ! money is cursed ! and of course everything that is cursed is attractive , otherwise the curse would not be a problem . '' he said that and i thought it was pretty smart . i mean , all of the cursed objects around the station are really fun to play with . until an inter gets hurt . like gustave the other day , who found radium squish ball from one of our old sta tin promotions . oh , quick aside : to the family of gustave , he was a distracted inter , and he will be missed . the king said , ` ` how many times has a person done something awful and you ca not understand why it happened ? only for the reason to be – money ! if there were a drug with the same side effects money has , it would be illegal . '' ` ` u m , maybe we can talk about this later ? '' i said . ` ` there are ceremony corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street tea ms heading this way now ! you ' ll be defenseless against them ! they ' ll round you up into te ch camp us relaxation zones and make you play videogames and drink energy shakes and and learn powerpoint ! you ' ll be t rapped for eternity ! '' he said , ` ` oh cecil . they came already . there was a squadron of them , hideous and flickering shadows with smiles of black fire , driving branded cars with terrible posture . and all of them were cheery and wearing shorts and saying things like ` ` devops '' . i asked if the street tea ms found what they were looking for . the king of the baristas said : ` ` we have taken care of them . '' and with his big hands , his big nimble hands , he reached into the matted animal skins on his chest , and he sorted through necklaces made of tiny bird skull and splenda packets . he fished out a thin badge that was embossed with the ceremony lo go . it still had the rampart vessels and the cheerfully crossed ( – ) mushrooms . but the name , the name on the badge , was ground away . ` ` this , '' the king of the baristas said , ` ` is all that ' s left of them . '' and he let out a little chuckle . if i could grade it on a scale between mirthful and mirthless , it was on the mirthful side of things . but there was also a bit of self-knowledge in it , as if the person chuckling were aware that to completely abandon himself to pleasure was to be unmoored from the realities of existence . he said the street team had covertly arrived over four years ago , in the dead of night , and worked their way to my desk . they recovered the case of canadian club and in celebration they opened a single bottle . they passed it around , and each one drank from it . but when they drank the soul of the time , they became in fused with it . by the time each had finished a single sip , they had become a part of this place , and the place had become a part of them . ` ` do you understand , cecil ? '' he asked . and i exclaimed , ` ` i get it ! rather than absorbing night vale ' s soul , night vale ' s soul absorbed them ! so ... we ' re all good . problems always solve themselves . thank you , king of the baristas ! '' there was an uncomfortable long pause . every barista was staring silently at me . and i worried that maybe this was a disrespectful way to address the king . i coughed a bit and then tried again with a classic barista joke to lighten the mood . ` ` your mother ' s so overcome with ennui that she - '' ` ` cecil , '' the king interrupted . ` ` we , the baristas , are the ceremony corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street team ! once we had become a part of night vale , we knew what we had to do , '' he said . and i said , ` ` ooooooo , i ca not wait to find out ! but can i check the weather report just really quick ? '' and he said , ` ` sure . go ahead . '' the king repeated : ` ` we knew what we had to do . '' he cackled a bit . ` ` have you ever noticed how , at one point , there were no baristas here , and then suddenly there were many , many baristas ? did it seem strange to you that every cafe now had a barista ? and every restaurant and market , pawn shop and dry cleaner ' s ? and how the vacant lots are no longer truly vacant , because they are populated by baristas ? have you noticed baristas at the antique mall , in the dmv , and close to but not in the dog park ? and the ones who run alongside cars as they ' re leaving the highway , to offers drivers shots of express ? have you noticed how no new buildings pass the city planning department , unless there a four-foot-by-four-foot space for a barista to stand ? did not that strike you as strange ? did it strike you as strange that your choice at any coffee establishment were only express , or express with a shot of canadian club ? '' the king said to me , wisely , carefully , giddy : ` ` cecil . after being absorbed in the soul of night vale , we knew we needed to save our city . so we served it to you . we served night vale , its own soul . night vale has drunk itself , and in the process become as much itself as any town could ever be . by then , the sun was starting to rise , and some of the baristas had settled down and were muddling and grooving each other in their little barista beds , as the fire in the cave was now turning to embers , and there were small ashes flittering like months around the pierre cups and chemex graphs and wind-powered aeropresses that cluttered every surface . i felt relief knowing the baristas were safe . and also confusion , knowing they had once been a te ch company social influence marketing effort . but also , civic pride , as night vale is darned good at defending itself against people who want to steal and drink our souls . but also itchiness , because of the animal pelts and long twirly mustache . ` ` the time of worry is not over , cecil , '' the king said . ` ` in fact , it is only beginning . ceremony wo not care that night vale ' s soul is safe . they ' ll send another street team and another , until they ' ve figured out how to di still our souls . and do you know why , cecil ? it ' s because of – money . '' listeners , this is terrible news ! mostly because i really do not like to hear bad things said about our station ' s sponsors . ` ` cecil , we need you to renounce money as a sponsor . do you know what ' s more important than money ? we do . we have taken steps this night , while you were here , your show is now sponsored not by but by – love . love is the way forward against ceremony ! '' i said ` ` u h huh , '' but i said it with skepticism , like exactly the way a cashier would if someone were about to buy something clutching a handful of love . then i said , ` ` suture , '' but like really sarcastically like you do after a poetry reading . he said : ` ` your battle is not yet over . ceremony wants that case of canadian club , even if it no longer exists . they ' re going to use every one of their tools . they ' ll use violence , intimidation , social media , dreamfluencing , vital marketing , even science ! they will win , unless you figure out a way to repel them ! '' and i said , ` ` u m pardon me , did you say that they ' ll use science ? '' and he thought about it and agreed that he had at some point said that . science , he said , was one of ceremony ' s mightiest weapons , and the king of the baristas said that he wished he knew of some way to fight against it . as soon as he said , i stood to my full height , which is one third taller than my three-quarters height . listeners , i must admit i was moved enough to actually put my hands by my hips , and my hands were fists , listeners . fists ! and i said , ` ` oh , i know how to fight back . there is only one weapon mightier than science , and that is – more science . '' and the king looked at me with amazement , as if i had unsuspected depths , and he said , ` ` do you know science ? '' do i , listeners , do i ? next time , i ' ll answer that question , but spoiled alert : gosh , neck yeah , of course . stay tuned next for adolescent steam ka rate bedbugs , the show your grand ma thinks you like , because she never understood you . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : why would you wan na think outside the box ? the box is steel and locked and buried deeply underground . it ' s so safe here . why would you want to leave ?
WTNV|"eGemony, Part 3: ""Love, Among Other Things, Is All You Need"""|1 December 2017|the captain has turned off the seatbelt signs , and has turned on the ceaseless anxiety signs . feel free to brood about the cabin . welcome to night vale . welcome , listeners . we have a new sponsor . our show is now sponsored by – love . u h definitely consider love when wanting to buy things , because ... love conquer all , makes the world go round , and is all you need . this has been a message from love , conqueror of our former sponsor , money . it ' s what makes a sugar a sugar . ok , i have returned from the distant cavelands of the baristas , an arduous journey made easier by it being pretty much downhill for the whole mile and a half . while i was there , i learned that the dreaded ceremony corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street team long ago became baristas . distributing night vale ' s case of canadian club to the citizens of night vale itself , meaning that night vale has been consuming its own soul , thus making us an ouroboros of our own serves . i returned because i knew that the best way to fight against ceremony ' s attempts to drink night vale ' s soul – was science . and i ' m very into science . or at least i ' m very into someone who is very into science . once a year , all the scientists in the world gather in luzerne , switzerland , to calibrate their instruments to the length of carlos ' hair . that appraisal is occurring right now , so of course , carlos is not in town . u m , i ' m on my own . because the cause of science is important , but so is defending night vale , and one of the best parts about being in a couple is that when each of you is good at one thing , it ' s like the couple is good at two things . this message was brought to you by – love . it turns out . huh . more of my plans to defeat ceremony as i desperately figure out what they are . but first , some local news . night vale community college announced its new slate of winter smelter continuing education course . introduction to jabbering , conversational jabbering , intermediate jabbering , advanced jabbering , and ikebana – the japanese art of flower arrangement . community college professor adriano copiello , who te aches french jabbering said , ` ` ouvrez vos lives à page 3 et cried amant de vous faire bouffer '' ( open your books to page 3 and scream before getting devoured ) * . professor copiello , once considered a failure in his field , has developed what he calls a ` ` charisma ray '' , and now everyone thinks he ' s a-ok , an exciting thinker and excellent dancer , and an entirely inadequate human being . when asked for comment , professor copiello responded by listing everything he could think of that was not a type of gum . by the time he finished , his charisma ray had worn off , and everyone realized professor copiello is in fact a terrible person , who at temps to court the friendship of students whose attractive naivete is subverted , ironically , by how they gradually accumulate the tools of critical analysis in his classes . meaning they apply what he himself taught them to judge him harshly , ultimately growing to resent his baseness , thus leaving his charisma ray utterly useless in the face of a cultural awakened classroom . professor copiello denied this by st ringing together a bunch of french verbs related to the behavior of asiatic animals . those interested in continuing education should read a book for once . ok , so earlier this morning , i walked across the street to get a two-pound bag of kiwis at ralph ' s , and had the most remarkable experience . well , first i passed the same barista i always pass along the way , the one at the abattoire . but this time she gave me a friendly wink of recognition . and then another barista , the one in the produce aisle , he scolded my face with steam and said my mother was so o pungent , people thought she was an roasted sumerian bean , and i have never felt so welcome . but the amazing thing was when i tried to pay for my fruit , the cashier said : ` ` do not you love kiwis ? '' and i said i did and he said : ` ` i love them too , and i love working here . so take the kiwis ! your love is your payment . '' so i took the kiwis and later shared them with my brother-in-law , steve carlsberg , who said : ` ` i love these ! '' then he added : ` ` i love you , brother ! '' and i nodded . it seems that night vale is now a love-based economy . oh , wait . this just in . ralph ' s would like to explain that the cashier made a mistake . it ' s perfectly fine that he loves working there , and that i love the kiwis , but i do still have to pay for them . that makes more sense . but i ' m a little disappointed . still , because of the incredibly effective new sponsorship of our program , love is definitely in the air in night vale . at dark owl records , there is now a loudspeaker outside and store owner michelle nguyen is publicly playing the records she loves the most . something she has never done . these albums are not vinyl but discs made of chalkboard slate , being spun underneath a needle and amplified through an outdoor speaker system . people who were strangers only moments ago are gazing into each other ' s eyes with looks of admiration and hunger . that made it awkward to spy on them . not impossible , of course , just awkward . which has caused several members of the vague yet menacing government agency , who sit outside our homes in dark sedan , to step out of their cars and offer hug s to anyone who would like to have a hug placed on their permanent record . there are reports of identified citizens running by mountains , waving flowers and balloons and handing out others . the sheriff ' s secret police have replaced their patrol car sirens with whitney houston ' s ` ` i will always love you '' . the hooded figures who stand in and around the forbidden dog park are still terrifying to look at , or even think about . but one of them is waving . that ' s probably the most expressive form of love that they have . love is everywhere . but also there has been a subtle shift . as love has become more prevalent , its value has decreased significantly . the angel who is definitely former millionaire marcus vanston , who is now named erika , said that they have drawn on a cocktail napkin an economic model for supplied feelings , where those with the most feelings will them trickle down the love to those with the least . even here in our radio studio , i am feeling such love for you , right now . listener , i love – this microphone . a and this cable . and the mixing board ! i love these blinking phone lines , oh ! you know , maybe we should take some calls . u m hi , this is cecil , you ' re on the air . anonymous call er : i love you . cecil : www , i love you too ! next call er , you ' re on the air with cecil palmer . same anon call er : i love you . cecil : did you just call from the other line ? anon call er : oh u h , no . i hm m , i love you . cecil : ah , my mistake . you know , i love our community . our mayor , our angels , and even – our weather . anon call er : i love you ! listeners , i would like to thank our newest sponsors , love , for bringing us today ' s show . but in all of my loving clamor , i lost sight of what was truly at stake . our newest inter , blake , brought back a familiar guest into our studio , thus reminding me of it . blake then tried to use the three-hole punch without reading the safety manual first . oh , quick aside : to the family of inter blake , he was a reckless inter , and he will be missed . but now , we welcome back to the radio station , hugh jack man of ceremony . hugh , i ' ve done some investigation journalism , and i ' m going to have to ask you the tough questions . first , i know that you ' re here to claim the case of canadian club , right ? hugh jack man : oh no , do not worry about that . cecil : well i am worried about that , among the many different things i worry about . you were coming back to get the case , you wanted me to look under my desk and ... hugh : not anymore , that ' s ok . cecil : but the barista king said ... hugh : cecil , i know about the baristas . i know about how night vale drank its own soul . cecil : oh . so does that mean that economy is going to , i dun no , just leave us alone then ? hugh : funny you should say that . when i followed you to the baristas ... cecil : you followed me ? hugh : sure . i was the one with the admiral tip pet sideburns ! cecil : oh my god that was you ? those were so good ! hugh : thank you , that took me hours to grow them . anyway , after all that i was planning on telling my team leaders at ceremony we were too late and to abandon our plans . cecil : whew ! well that ' s good . hugh : and to buy all of night vale to help with ceremony ' s debt acquisition . cecil : oh , well that ' s bad . hugh : there ' s a glitch . i ' ve fallen in love . cecil : pardon ? hugh : ceremony has highly secure communications , corporate demands that we only send messages on postcard from lakeside resorts ... oh , i should not have said that out loud . si ri , remind me to prostrate myself before hr at 4 pm today . anyway , i was at the post office standing in line behind – well , it was the strangest thing , you ' ll never guess , i was standing in line behind ... cecil : a dog with a man ' s head , yeah , that guy ' s always there . hugh : u m , spoiled ! we do not have quite so many folks like that back at the office , and it made me pay closer attention to – everything around me . the first thing i noticed was this particular post office was selling stamps . then i noticed the stamps had no denomination on them , just the word ` ` forever '' . i ' ve worked in retail before , put myself through high school operating ( – ) that sold decorative soap and customers there , as you might well guess , can be mean or even cruel , saying things like , ` ` do you have anything vanilla-scented '' or u m , they d also say things like , ` ` i d like to buy some soap . '' it was awful ! so i am always extraordinarily polite to clerks , sometimes even flirtatious . and when i got to the head of the line at the post office , i winked at the clerk , and seven of her eight eyes winked back , and then i said : ` ` forever stamps ? that ' s quite a promise . '' and you know what she said ? cecil : no . hugh : nothing . it turns out she was a spider and did not care what i thought , but cecil , it was the way she did not care ! i had a ( mackinac ) island postcard to mail , and it was important because it ' s my report back about how we ' re going subsume night vale . cecil : ok , see this is what i was getting at . hugh : and i realized that she probably sent a dozen ( mackinac ) island postcard that day and mine was no different . she asked me if anything in my envelope was liquid , hazardous , insidious , shameful , or emotional fragile and i said : ` ` no more so than my heart . '' and then a mosquito hawk got caught in her web and she raced over to wrap it into webbing and then dissolved its body with her venom so she could later drink its liquid corpse like a child with a juice box . cecil : awwwwww ! hugh : i know , it was so sweet ! now , i am not a poetic man , cecil , but i was inspired . have you noticed that love seems to be in the air right now ? like that maria carey song : ` ` i had a vision of love and it was this crazy dream where i was in a park , and trees were made entirely out of recycle aluminium can s , and you were there but you looked just like me , only with a nose bleed . '' cecil : oh , i love that song ! my husband and i danced to that at our wedding ! hugh : anyway , i was close enough to smell her perfume and , well , i asked if i could have a book of the ` ` forever '' stamps , and she asked which kind . and i said : ` ` the wonder woman stamps '' , and she said that they were out of them , so i said because i ' ve worked in retail before , and i try to feel like all of us are in this together , that i was feeling shortchanged by the whole ` ` forever '' business then . and i said it with a frown on my lips , but a smile in my eyes . like this ? see ? cecil : u h yes , please stop . hugh : cecil , she handed me back my change and said : ` ` next human entity in line .

WTNV|All Smiles' Eve|15 December 2017|kevin : how do i love thee ? let me count your teeth . happy all smiles ' eve , desert bluff ! kevin : hi listeners ! it ' s kevin ! lauren : and lauren ! kevin : we hope you ' re all having the smiling est all smiles ' eve you could have ever wished for . lauren : desert bluff 2 , welcome to our holiday show , where we retell classic story of all smiles ' eve . kevin : we ' ll also have great last minute gift ideas and cooking tips ! but first , let ' s have a look around town to see how people are celebrating this most wonderful of holidays . lauren : of course , our old city of desert bluff is no more . it ' s been swallowed up by the town of night vale , but we found a new home here in the desert otherworld ! kevin : we ' re broadcast ing now from the scenic lighthorse at op a tall mountain . looking out over endless , sand-covered nothingness . lauren : i like the sand . it ' s my favorite part of living here . kevin : i like the nothingness . lauren : it really clears the mind . but there are moments of something-ness . and there are beautiful displays of lights and crafts . oh , frank donnelly , who lives at op the northwest bluff , has st rung up a series of colourful gasoline canister over his forefront , where he sells tarantula parts . at dusk , he sets each can on fire , and the burning plastic just melts away spill ing down on the people below . alejandra salazar , who lives in a cave just to the south base of this mountain , has painted lips and teeth around the entrance to her home ! and my favorite holiday decoration this year is ( kunit final ' s ) smile tree . kevin : oh h ! lauren : mm hm , she ' s built a 20-foot tall cactus out of human teeth ! she even used coyote skins turned inside out to look like flowers . kevin : ah , i love people ' s creativity this time of year ! it ' s so fun to walk around town and see the night lit up with seasonal joy . to smell the burning petroleum products , to hear the screams and feel the warm fire in the cool dry air . lauren : you truly do love the holidays . kevin : lauren , i think it ' s time to tell the story of all smiles ' eve ! lauren : ye-he-hee , let ' s go ! kevin : once , there was a family , the goods , who lived in the desert . two mothers , a father , a daughter , a son , three dogs , the front half of a cat and a very long house . they were a happy family , but no one knew it . people would often say to them , ` ` you d be so happy if you just smiled , '' but the good family would always say ` ` we are smiling , we are happy ! '' it ' s just that no one could see their smiles . their faces always remained in a neutral state . even the good family could not tell when each other were smiling . each one thought the other was unhappy , because none of them had a visible smile . sometimes the mothers would ask their younger child : ` ` why are you sad , felicia ? '' and felicia would say : ` ` i am not sad , mothers ! '' and then felicia would smile , and her mothers would smile , but none of them appeared to be smiling to each other , and they would all remain sad . sometimes the father broke things on purpose , like vases or the children ' s toys , or the children ' s toy vases , or birds . it brought him great joy breaking things , because it reminded him that he was autonomous . but to the outside eye , it looked like an expressionless man smashing random objects . the older child , jason , had a piece of lumber he carried around with him always . it was a banister from an old stairwell railing , and he loved it ! he had named it jason also , because it reminded him of himself , and he would dress the stick in similar shirts and parts . felicia asked him : ` ` why do you dress like that stick , jason ? '' ` ` it makes me happy , '' jason said . ` ` see ? see how i smile , sister ? '' ` ` no , '' she said . their neighbors and friends wanted the goods to be happy . and they were . but they could not smile . the goods though they were smiling , but they were not . no one knew how to solve the problem , because no one knew what the problem was . lauren : oh h . this part makes me slightly less happy than i always am . kevin : oh yes . when people do not smile , everyone else has to smile even harder . lauren : i ca not wait to hear how the story ends . but now , let ' s share some of our favorite holiday dishes ! kevin : ooohohohooo ! lauren : yeah . i know you all out there are busily preparing your all smiles ' day meals . kevin , what is your favorite dish ? kevin : oo o ! when i was a boy , my father used to make caramel . he would pour a whole bag of sugar into a large pot and put it over the highest heat . then he would stir and stir , slowly mixing in heavy cream , until the sugar liquefied and toast ed . then , as the syrupy came to a boil , he would call the kid s into the kitchen and we would all open our hands , and he would pour the boiling caramel into our cupped palms ! ooh , it burned our hands so badly , but that was no problem , because we just forced the sweet caramel quickly into our mouths , where it also badly burned our tongues and lips . ooh ! it was one of my happiest memories ! years later , when i was an adult , i found a starling in a shopping center parking lot . its head had been crushed by a car tire , and its rear leg was still twitching . i watched it for about ... 15 minutes , until it stopped moving . lauren : thanks for that recipe , kevin ! ha h ! my favorite holiday dish is ravish casserole . it ' s really easy to make . you just pull the stems off , then using a peeled you remove the red skin . then , place the ravish in a food processor and blend it until it ' s a stiff paste . pour onto a plate and voila , ha ha ! kevin : i still do not know who killed that starling . lauren : let ' s continue with our story of all smiles ' eve . the good family began treating themselves more gently , considering that perhaps they maybe were dealing with something more serious than just a lack of happiness . one mother told the other mother that depression and anxiety are more common than we think , and the other mother said : ` ` we should listen to each other more and try to better understand our pain . '' ` ` pain is something we can all understand , '' the father said , and he pointed to the half-cat under the shrub , which they had adopted last month when they found it decomposing on their lawn . they named the half cat mr . doodles . ` ` www ! '' the whole family cooed . ` ` mr . doodles ! '' they all smiled , noticeably . jason and felicia wanted their friends to know they were happy , so they began practicing smiling in the mirror , but even they could not see a change in their faces . plus , mirrors were upsetting because of all the people who would gather behind them in the reflection , that were not actually there when they turned around to face them . but one day , the good family ' s life would change . because they would meet – the smiling god ! kevin : oooooooooooo-o-o-oo.. lauren : i know ( – ) .. kevin : laureeeeeeen , i love this part ! we ' ll be back with more of the story in a moment . but let ' s talk about some last minute gift ideas . lauren : i know a lot of you out there waited until the last possible moment to buy your all smiles ' day gifts . but not to worry , because there are plenty of meaningful gifts you can get right now . kevin : you could even make something . people enjoy receiving handcrafted gifts from loved ones . for instance , lauren , i bought some yarn and then ... lauren : ah a ? kevin : hand-knitted you this sweat er ? lauren : www , kevin ! ! ! it ' s beautiful , i-i-it ' s covered in ... are these worms ? kevin : sure are ! i bought those at the bait shop . lauren : amazing . and kevin , i bought you some cologne ! kevin : i do not wear cologne . lauren : that ' s when i bought you cologne . i special ordered it from a parfumerie in frenchie . it ' s called ( – ) . i can see by your grin that you love it . i ' ll spray some on you . kevin : oh , it burns ! ! lauren : havana ! it ' s acid . kevin : look at all the little bubbles forming on my wrist ! ah , i can see my veins ! lauren : listeners , you may not have time to knit a sweat er and staple live worms to it , or special order a foreign cologne ... kevin : ooohoohoo.. lauren : but here are a few ideas to help you out in your last minute gift buying . people love animals . maybe buy them a dog . or how about a coupon book full of ch ores you ' ll do for them , like ` ` i ' ll clean the dishes for one whole month '' or ` ` i ' ll beginning you for my life '' or ` ` i ' ll sharpen your teeth while you sleep . '' kevin : i ' m sure those are great gift ideas , lauren . i was not listening because my arm hurts so much . ooh , let ' s continue with our story of all smiles ' eve . lauren : ok . kevin : one day , the good family felt hot . they lived in the desert because they loved feeling hot , so this made them very happy . their feet burned , they could not hold still , they leapt up and down to keep their feet from being completely scorched , and it looked like a dance . they were joyously happy , they smiled and smiled , but to anyone watching , they looked like the saddest dances ever . they heard a loud pop , as the sand raound their ho em burst skyward and th smiling god emerged . ` ` iii am the smiling good , '' the smiling god said . and the good family ' s ears began to melt away . they clutched at their heads , screaming . they had never felt so happy . ` ` why are you not happy ? '' the god asked . ` ` you u should bee happy ! '' the god demanded . ` ` we are ! '' the good family insisted . ` ` see us smiling ? '' ` ` no o ! '' the god said . ` ` but soon i will ! '' and the smiling god told them about purity and about devouring . the smiling god showed the family a powerpoint presentation on the subject of purity , even though powerpoint , let alone computers , would not be invented for more than a century . the good family happily watched the smiling god ' s lecture . they smiled imperceptibly through the whole thing . and the smiling god grew furious , because it could not see how happy they were . the smiling god said to the good family , saying ` ` behold ! you will smile so much , you will never want to stop ! '' the good family said : ` ` we are smiling ! '' but the smiling god had already devoured their home in one heaving gulp . all that remained was a smoldering pit and scattered debris . jason , the boy , found splinters of jason the stick . mr . doodles was now only a fourth of a cat . ` ` www , '' the whole family cooed , ` ` mr . doodles ! '' their long house was a long – pit . and every single mirror in their home was gone , along with the ghastly figures who gathered in the reflections . and the good family was so happy and so afraid . they concentrated hard on making the biggest smiles they could , but the smiling god could not see their pure joy on their bland faces . lauren : oh ! oh oh oh , i ca not wait to hear the end of this story , kevin . but for now , let ' s get to today ' s weather .

they have accidentally each stolen the money from the other . and now , a story of love – and horror . frances donelson runs the antique mall in old time night vale . long before she took on that job though , she developed an interest in time . as a child , she would stand still and consider that while she had not moved at all in space , something had changed . that she had grown just slightly older , her hair just slightly longer , and this without being able to see the movement at all . she liked to lie in bed and , through her window , watch planes pass very high in the sky . she liked to think about where they had taken off and where they might land . objects fascinate her , because they too moved through time , on a different trajectory than her . her bedroom lamp had existed , looking more or less like it was now , since before she was born , and could well exist after she had died . it was not even aware , was too unable to move , and yet it joined her in this mad hurdle through time . she found this terrifying , and she found this fascinating . and she found this delightful and she wanted it to stop . and she hoped it never stopped , and she felt all of these feelings equally and at once , and without contradiction . what use was there in worrying if all of what she felt about time did not exactly add up ? she was too busy feeling it to consider what it meant . and so , of course , she became fascinate with antique . these objects washed up from the crooked tides of time . nazr al-mujaheed coaches the night vale high school football team . go scorpions . and this was almost the entirety of his world . he thought about football when he woke up , he thought about it on the drive to work . of course he thought about it when he ran practices and had meetings with the assistant coaches , and he thought about it at night when he ate take-out dinners on his couch while watching football . this made him happy . and what makes a person happy , if it does not harm another person and does not harm themselves , is ok . even if it ' s not how anyone else would want to live . but while it made him happy , nazr was also aware that is more than one kind of happiness . and that perhaps this happiness he found in a life endless ly thinking about football , was less than the happiness he could find in a life with more things in it . this was not about fixing a problem , this was an attempt to improve on a good situation . this was his play for some sort of grace . other people he knew could provide an outside perspective , and perhaps allow him to be less focused on his work and on the game he coach ed . and so he decided he would try dating . without expectations , without a plan , just as a way to see what the world might have for him . and now , a word from our sponsors . ford ! our cars are built strong , strong like a rock or a mountain or a bone . in fact , our cars are built out of bones , weird metal bones that were buried in a mete or . what creature did they belong to ? how did it live with a skeleton of steel ? are its relatives even now streaming down from the sky , intent on evening themselves upon the pitiful culture that desecrate their dead and turned them into unfordable and reliable pick up truck s ? who knows . we certainly do not . we barely understand how an engine works . we have one guy who knows , and he build them all . but in order to protect his job , he wo not show anyone else how to do it . now that ' s smart thinking . ford : drive weird bones . there was no great epiphany for frances that led to her dating life . she had been on the dating a pp , void , since it had become available in night vale , and had gone on a few casual void dates . it was not an important part of her life , because it did not seem likely to ever lead to anything more . but the occasional company was nice . a night with someone , and then back to her life as it was , which was a life she liked . in this way , her dating was related to her possession with time . her bed was always the same bed , and sometimes there was another person in it . and mostly only her . she floated upon that bed as it moved through time . passengers on and off , and she alone foraging onward . and then , nazr message her on void and they started chatting . for his part , he was un sure of how to date , it having been some time since he had done and certainly before dating happened as a series of written communications , rather than awkward hand gestures . so he had message a number of women in town , who had seemed to him like someone he might want to spend more time with . he did this without expectation . he had few expectations that did not involve football . he just performed the actions that might lead to new outcome for him , and three of the women had message back . he was , after all , not a bad looking man , handsome even , although it had been a long time since anyone had told him that . and so it would not have occurred to him that he was handsome , and this in many ways made him even more handsome . frances and he agreed to meet for lunch near the high school . this was close enough to her antique store that she could walk , and so the whole thing did not feel to either of them like much of a commitment of time . ` ` so , '' he said , once they had sat down with their food . ` ` so , '' she agreed , and for an awful moment it seemed like it would hang there in uncomfortable silence , and a bad date best forgotten . but then he asked about antique , because he himself had an interest in old football trophies . and he agreed that might seem a bit weird , but the thing was that their designs were often fascinating . never having been meant to stand up under scrutiny , crude ly carved players , hands like dinner rolls , feet disappearing into the base of the trophy . and this turned into a discussion of all the many old items that would never be valuable from the viewpoint of capitalism , but were more interesting than the ones that were valuable . from this , the conversation spread out into her fascination with time . and then time itself , and their childhood , and how it was hard sometimes to remember that they themselves were adults . and in nazr ' s case , older than his parents ever lived to be . on returning to work , nazr started the afternoon football practice as usual . and as usual , threw himself into the rhythm of drills , spells and counter-spells that make up any football skirmish . but he found , for the first time in his life , that he could not make himself fully focus . there was a part of him still thinking about the lunch , about the way her hands had looked tapping on the table . about the way she talked about time as it were not an implacable force , but an old and fallible friend . he had to continually draw himself back into practice , and the players wondered if he perhaps was sick . frances stood at the window of her antique shop watching the planes fly overhead . when a person entered the shop , she would acknowledge them vaguely with a nod , and then acknowledge them vaguely with a nod again when they left . but otherwise , she kept her eyes on the window . something in her chest felt tight , but also less heavy . she was both scared and happy , and she was not sure why she was either of those . when later they both message and decided to go on a second date , an evening date at a nice restaurant , something with a bit more commitment behind it , neither of them connected it directly to the way they felt after their lunch together . but both of them could not contain their impatience , and had message that very evening . both at exactly 10:55 pm . let ' s have a look at that weather . there was a second date . and that night , she went with him back to his house . then a third date , when they went to her house . then a few more dates where they sometimes went to one of their houses and sometimes just kissed , wild with the feeling of it . out in the park lot of whatever restaurant or bar they had met at , before saying good night because they had to work in the morning , and they were adults who sometimes had control of themselves . this was not one of those nights , though . this was a night that she was in his bed and he was asleep . this was a little over a month after their first date . as she lay sleepy and happy , she watched the to , which was tint ing the darkness a soft flickering blue . it was an old episode of ` ` friends '' , in which joe y rolls limply and slowly , over the course of 21 minutes , across the apartment while out of focus in the background , phoebe searches desperately through every cabinet and screams . frances had seen the episode too many times to laugh out loud at , but still it felt comforting to watch , like sitting in a room that she liked . the episode had become a place she could go , rather than a story to follow . there was a commercial break and a p sa from the secret police came on , featuring the adorable cartoon spokesdog , barks ennui . he capered about , pointing out all the different ways one could break the law in night vale and get sentenced to a forever term in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town . she found herself grinning at his bad puns in the section about reporting on your neighbors : ` ` traitorous activities can be ruff ! go fetch us their deepest secrets ! '' and then barks said her name . his cartoon ca nine face turned directly to the screen and he said , ` ` frances . '' she did not know how to respond . a commercial had never spoken to her , and certainly it had never done what barks did next , which was to step out of the to screen in a clumsy flapping movement and then sit up , a two-dimensional flickering cartoon dog standing in the bedroom . ` ` frances , '' barks said . ` ` you are not supposed to be here . this does not belong to you . '' he cocked his animated head , the wall of nazr ' s apartment vaguely visible through him , as though through heavy fog . as his head turned , it sagged in the direction of the ground , stretching and distort ing his cartoon puppy face until it was a series of drooping oval . when he spoke again , his voice sounded stretched too . ` ` you will have to make this right , frances ! '' he marbled . ` ` you will have to make this right ! '' she screamed . nothing happened . she screamed . stay tuned next , just – stay tuned . next . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : welcome to 2018. the year we finally do it . the year we eat the sun .
WTNV|"A Story of Love and Horror, Part 2: ""Spire"""|15 February 2018|do you hear that sweet melody ? that sweet melody on the breeze ? no one else hears that sweet melody , that sweet melody on the breeze . welcome to night vale . frances did her best to pretend that she had imagined what she had seen that night in the house of nazr al-mujaheed . when barks ennui , the cartoon spokesdog for the sheriff ' s secret police , had come out of the television and told her that she does not belong , and that they were both doomed . this obviously was not an easy thing to forget , but people forget difficult things every day . we are all of us carrying around difficult things like cannon balls rolling , unstable in our heads , occasionally throwing us off balance when they shift too much to one side . but mostly , just slowing us down while we pretend nothing is wrong . she and nazr continued to see each other . he let people know at school , and the faculty and administration were happy for him . everyone felt that he was always too consumed by high school football . especially principal fryman , who grumbled to himself that the team did not even have a good record to show for all of that possession . nazr took frances to a faculty after school drinks meet-up , the first one he had ever gone to , because he always spent his evenings prepping for that week ' s practice , studying game film , drawing up defensive schemes , and glittering around his living room on his belly while hissing like a snake . frances , in turn , took him to her monthly book club meet-up . this month ' s book had been irving welsh ' s ` ` harry pott er and the cursed child '' , the controversial follow-up to his classic novel ` ` transporting '' . everyone agreed that it was not nearly as good as the original , since it only shared a couple of the main characters . they also agreed that frances ' relationship was having a real effect on her . ` ` you hardly seem like the same person , '' said jeremy , who had liked frances before and was jealous that she might change and grow as a person , outside of his influence . jeremy was , all in all , being a real shit . everyone else agreed that she seemed to be happier and more open to the world than before she had started dating . frances quietly wondered if changing so quickly , just because you were eating meals with and sometimes sleeping with someone , was a good or bad or neutral thing . she thought that change was hardly ever neutral . through all of this , she pretended that barks ennui , the cartoon dog , did not appear to her most evenings in her home . but he did . he would crawl out of her television , even if she was watching a channel his commercial did not play on , or even if the television was off . the proportions of his body , lovably clumsy interview wo dimensions , seemed a horrify ing mistake of nature in three dimensions . and his features were warped and blurred , as though seen through static . ` ` you do not belong together , '' barks ennui said in a goofy cartoon voice that occasionally veered dazzlingly into other pitch es . sometimes a child ' s giggler , or a bass growl for a few seconds before sliding back to the middle . she would hide under her covers , and she would hear from within the hot dark of her blanket , his familiar cartoon voice say : ` ` there is a price that must be pay ed ! '' and she would scream and scream and then realize she was alone . and then she would choose to pretend that none of this had happened . nazr did not see barks ennui . but he was not without his own troubles . he would find , some evenings , that when he looked in the mirror , there were two of him . one of him sitting behind the other . he would stand and the second reflection would stand too . it would follow all of his movements from behind is primary reflection . this went on for days . then one night , he looked in the mirror and there was only one of him . he sighed , feeling some relief to the tension that had been with him so long as to become his new normal . and that is when , in the mirror , his second reflection into the room , followed by frances donelson . nazr whirled . the room he was in was empty . he looked back in the mirror . there was his own face , terrified , and behind that on the bed , there was himself again with frances . the two of them were kissing passionately . he watched himself kiss , and then his reflection and the frances in the mirror stopped watching and looked up at him with startled faces . they stayed frozen that way , and he stayed frozen too . after several moments , the mirror couple smiled . their smiles got wider and wider , and then they were both dead , blood covered and sprawling at irregular angles . and then – they were alive again and smiling at him . he shouted and stumbled back form the mirror . from them on , he too to covering his mirrors , and that worked for a few days . but then one day , he came home to find himself in his bedroom , already sitting in front of the covered bedroom mirror . the him that was in his bedroom looked up at him who had just entered , with wide eyes and a yawning mouth and nazr , who believed himself to be the real nazr , turned and walked out of his house . he checked into a mot el and decided to stay there for a while . finally the strain broke on nazr and frances . at apple bee ' s over lunch , she started crying , and he was so surprised that he started crying . and they were crying at each other and did not know why the other was crying . and she said , ` ` this is going to sound crazy '' , and he said , ` ` you ' re not going to believe me . '' and then they told each other , and it did not sound crazy , and she believed him . ` ` what does it mean ? '' she said . ` ` why are we being punished just because we ' re finally seeing someone ? '' ` ` that ' s a good question , '' said barks ennui . he was sitting in the booth next to them . they both yelled in surprise , and the other people in the restaurant looked over with a mix of confusion and annoyance . none of them could see barks , and so they assumed the couple must have accidentally ordered the electrolysis nachos appetite . ` ` who are you ? '' asked nazr . ` ` me ? '' said barks , his animation dog face stretching and compressing in mesmerizingly horrify ing ways . ` ` i ' m a construct ! '' he said , ` ` in order to allow communication '' . ` ` communication with who ? '' said frances . ` ` i represent the brown stone spire , '' said barks . the brown stone spire was a strange monument at the edge of town . it offered great gifts in exchange for even greater sacrifices . it was extremely dangerous , and neither of them had ever heard of it trying to communicate with anyone . barks continued : ` ` everything ' s gone strange since you started dating . you know what i ' m talking about ? '' ` ` maybe , '' nazr said , thinking of the mirrors in his home . ` ` maybe ? '' repeated barks mildly . ` ` maybe it will get even stranger . maybe your conditions will continue to deteriorate . '' ` ` what do you mean deteriorate ? '' she said . ` ` we ' re two people dating , what ' s wrong with that ? '' ` ` this town is a point where many universe meet , '' said barks . he was on the other side of the table , next to frances now . ` ` recently those universe collapse into each other . when the mess was finally sorted out , not everyone ended up in the right universe . '' ` ` it ' s me , '' said nazr , ` ` that explains it . the other me in my house , plus my tongue is like two feet long and that does not seem right . i do not belong in this universe . '' ` ` no , '' said barks . ` ` it ' s frances . she does not belong here . frances , you switched places during the collapse with the frances of this world , and you are coming into contact with a person from a different universe , which has an exceptionally detrimental effect on reality . i believe , '' he said to nazr , ` ` you were saying something about reflections in your house ? '' and now , a look at traffic . the cosmology of the universe is thus . first , there is the sphere . the indications of the sphere are warmth and brittle . the colors of the sphere are blue and yellow . then , there is the cub e . the indications of the cub e are touch and lift . the colors of the cub e are red and white . then , there is the expansive plane . the indications of the expansive plane are speed and shadow . the colors of the expansive plane are myriads . and finally , there is the outward fade . the indications of the outward fade are a ringing bell and a rush of water . the colors of the outward fade are none . this has been traffic . and now a word from our sponsors . mute children perched at op strange formations on desert plateau . our eyes gaze toward a horizon that will never change . there is no movement here , no sun , but there is light . no darkness , but there is night . we do not need to eat , but we are hungry . we have no way to drink , but we are thirsty . we have nothing to sell you . remember us . this has been a word from our sponsors . frances could not believe it . or she could , but she resolutely chose not to . nazr thought again and again of the other him and the other her , lying dead on his bed and then smiling . and then dead again . it was true that something was horribly wrong . perhaps they did not belong together . perhaps they did not belong together so much that the universe itself was collapsing around the relationship . it was not fair . did not both of them deserve happiness ? cecil here . i ' ll go ahead and answer that . they did ! but what a person receives and what they deserve is only ever tangentially and co incidentally related . they decided they should go to the brown stone spire . it had offered to help them . they should at least hear out what it was asking for in return . nazr drove them . cars stop working within a few hundred feet of the spire , as the spire prefers humans to approach on foot . actually , it prefers humans to approach on their bellies , but it takes humble walking as a compromise . the closest parking lot is the radio shock , but of course that one is always full of customers , and so they park ed at the wen dy ' s and walked . her foot started bothering her , but she did not know if it was actually bothering her or if she was just afraid of what the brown stone spire would say . the brown stone spire hummed . they fell to their knees before it . ` ` help us ! '' said nazr . ` ` we just want to be together , '' frances said . ` ` i do not know if we belong together , but we make each other happy . is not that something worthwhile ? do not we get at least that ? '' the brown stone spire heard . it hummed . it already knew the problem and it already knew the solution . and it already knew the price . it told these humans all three by implanting the thoughts directly in their brains . frances threw up . nazr wept . there was a solution , but the price was unthinkable . it was impossible , it was inhuman . of course , the spire is not human nor possible nor even unthinkable . they walked back to the car in silence . and now , the weather . that evening , they sat in frances donelson ' s living room and thought about what to do . ` ` impossible , '' she said . ` ` unthinkable , '' he said . ` ` then we agree ? '' she said . ` ` of course we agree , '' he said . ` ` what else is there ? '' he said . ` ` we ' re not monsters , '' he said . ` ` right , '' she said . ` ` i want to show you something , '' said barks ennui . he was on the to screen so close that whatever back drop was invisible , just his exaggerated snout and his wild eyes . ` ` come here ! '' both of them knew for certain they would refuse , and both stepped forward obediently . ` ` in here ! '' said barks . ` ` into the to ! '' frances put her hand on the screen and felt nothing . it was a hollow frame . she put her hand through the frame . her hand felt like her hand , no different than it had a moment before . she leaned down and put her tarso in , and she felt a pull , like gravity . and she fell downwards through the to screen . she was in her living room again . it looked very much like her living room , although a few details were different . the framed poster from the international muse ( du chats ) in paris was now from the muse international ( de los gates ) in mexico city . the taxidermy deer foot pen holder on the mantle was now a taxidermy boa r ' s foot pen holder . nazr tumbled in next to her . ` ` oh , cool pen holder , '' he said . frances took his hand and helped him up . they looked around , and then out the front window . frances was outside working in a garden . a different frances , in the garden being watched by the first frances in the living room . ` ` the frances from your universe , nazr , '' said barks . his three-dimensional form was enormous this time , taking up the living room from floor to ceiling , although he displaced nothing in it , and frances and nazr had plenty of room to stand . ` ` she ended up in this universe and the frances from this universe , that ' s you frances , ended up in hers , a silly mix-up . but these things do need to be set right , or else both of you will slip further and further into the gap between universe , until neither of you exist anymore ! '' frances could not take her eyes off herself in the garden . ` ` try to stay together , '' said barks , ` ` and you both will cease to exist ! '' the frances in the garden waved to jackie pierre , who was biking past . a car drove by . in it was dana cardinal and her brother . they waved , too . ` ` enough ! '' said barks , grabbing them and pulling them upward . they were all back in the couch in frances ' living room , or the living room she had thought was hers . there was only one frances here . ` ` you know the price , '' said barks . he crawled backwards into the to , staring intently with his droop animated eyes . ` ` there are only two ways forward . the first is that this frances returns to her correct universe , and you two never see each other again . the other would allow the two of you to live as long and as happy as anyone can together . it would be simple , but in order for that to happen , the spire will destroy the other universe and every person who lives within it . that frances and every other person in that world will cease to exist , but then you would be able to flourish in this universe . '' he was fully back onto the screen , a two-dimensional cartoon dog in a none yellow cartoon back drop . but his eyes were still huge , like they were inches away . ` ` you do not have long to decide ! '' he gave a silly laugh , the kind he did at the end of his appearance on children ' s shows . the laugh that made children laugh back at how silly it was . but this silly laugh did not end . for several minutes , nazr and frances stared at him , and he looked back , laughing . stay tuned next for decision to be made . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : i ' m going to give you a piece of my mind . it ' s in this clay jar . please keep it in a cool , dark place and away from cats .
WTNV|"A Story of Love and Horror, Part 3: ""Frances"""|1 March 2018|who was that whistling , whistling in the dark ? was that you , my love , whistling , whistling in the dark ? welcome to night vale . frances donelson and nazr al-mujaheed were faced with a terrible choice . there are times , as humans , it feels like we are given more responsibility than we can handle . it feels as though the world is resting on our backs . and any decision we make could have implication for everyone else in the entire world . but of course , that ' s not really the case . the truth is , while we might be able to ruin our own lives , or even a whole bunch of people ' s lives , there are few who are ever put in the position where they can make even a ripple in the life of everyone on earth . but this was exactly the situation frances and nazr found themselves in . she had accidentally entered this night vale from a night vale in a different universe . if nazr and frances stayed together , the two of them could both phase out of reality and cease to exist . a powerful entity , the brown stone spire , could make it so they could stay together safely , but only by destroying the universe she came from , and every person in it . there was no path forward for their love that did not end in horror . there was no path forward without horror that did not end their love . ` ` it ' s clear what we have to do , '' said nazr sadly . ` ` no two people are worth so many lives . we must go our separate ways . '' already he could see the long evenings alone in his office , watching tapes of football plays and trying to recaptured the innocent happiness he used to feel doing his job . ` ` it ' s clear to you because you have other option , '' said frances . ` ` you ' re from this world , and you could find another to love . ` ` i would not , '' tried nazr , but predictions like this can never carry the weight of truth , because who can predict the heart ? '' ` ` you will find someone else , '' she said . ` ` and me , i will have to live alone forever or risk my own existence and the existence of everyone i entangled myself with . can i even have close friendships or would those too result in an unravelling ? certainly i would be afraid to risk it , and in that fear i would settle into a bleak loneliness . '' he shook his head . ` ` so what are you saying ? that we should murder a universe of living beings ? '' ` ` i ' m saying , '' she said , ` ` that i love you , and i d like to proceed from there . '' after this argument , they did not talk or see each other for a few days . both of them felt completely overwhelmed by the weight of the decision . both of them pretended it was a settled question for themselves . and now corrections . despite previous reports , the ineffable is not real . it ' s a joke , a trace . a sandwich left on a park bench . a misunderstood smile from an unfriendly crowd . the accidental arrangement of the sky . the distance from the earth to the moon . the way grass feels when it gets a little dry . a hand reaching blandly into a drawer . a word spoken once and never again said aloud . a dream which seemed prophetic , but elaborated upon waking . a stain in a shirt that ' s source is a mystery . a bird with three missing feathers . a ma th problem with no possible solution . a sign post to a place which never existed . it ' s a trace , a joke . the ineffable is not real . we apologize for our previous mistaken report . during the days apart , frances and nazr were not alone . they were not alone first in ways that were mundane and expected . for instance , nazr had his team , and while he was distracted and morose , he was also determined not to let this affect the chances of his good kid s . and so he forced himself to double his efforts when it came to practices . and if any of the team members of faculty thought anything about his behavior during this time , it was that he seemed especially dedicated and focused . and so therefore his relationship must be benefit ing him . frances had her customers . and while an antique store does not usually bustle , it does have a steady stream . and the goal is to sell a few high-end items a day , along with a good amount of cheap trinkets , so that it all even s out , and she would have enough money to eat for another month . she had friends , too , except now she felt they were not her friends . her friends were back in another universe and the people here looked like her friends , but did not share exactly the same experiences this frances remembered . she did not know if this should matter but felt that it did , and so avoided her friends . her friends when they talked , thought she must be so focused on her happy relationship that she no longer had time for them , and they felt resentment . they did not resent her personally , but rather resented the situation . but frances and nazr were not alone in a more malevolent way as well . every evening , barks ennui visited each of them . frances no matter where she went would find him sitting next to her . he would sigh . ` ` frances ! '' he would say softly . ` ` frances ! '' the voice was almost kind , but his eyes were piloted toward her unnaturally , giant 2-d sources on a 3-dimensional yellow snout . ` ` frances , oh frances , '' he would murmur until she slept or thought she slept . he was less gentle with nazr . with nazr , he screamed . no words , merely a high keeping in the living room as nazr tried to watch game tapes , or in the bathroom as he washed his teeth . first a mundane quiet and then suddenly a huge dog screaming , cartoon eyes and cartoon mouth both gaping in terror . why was barks afraid ? he was the specter who was hunting nazr , but barks was afraid . this made nazr even more afraid . ` ` stop screaming ! '' he would scream back , but barks did not seem to hear . and now sports news . now i ' m a big fan of night vale football , because i love our town , and our kid s who are out there playing , and our fabulous co aching staff . but to be honest , i ' m often a little shak y on how the sport works , so i thought i d try a little experiment . i will now attempt , without looking up anything or consulting anyone le se , to explain the rules of football form memory . let ' s see , the kid s enter the field . u h , there ' s a lot of them , they ' re all padded up and ready . u h , ` ` hurrah '' they say , and others shout : ` ` let ' s get the football ! '' they are there to get the football . they line up facing each other , u h someone shouts some numbers that they like , in order to get them in a happy head space before starting the game , and then the football is thrown weird . it could be thrown much easier , but they throw it in a weird way . the quarter back catches the ball , mostly , u h sometimes they miss and that ' s a foul . but if they catch it , then they try to speak it down the field . the ball needs to get going , but no one can know the team is doing it , and so they try to act nonchalant . oh , and also the slam dance with the other team in order to show that they ' re only there to party . and no football is going down the field , mm mm , no way . but it is ! the other team figures this out and jumps at the football . eventually , the football is carried to what is called the ` ` end zone '' , because it ' s a zone at the end of the field . there it transform from a leather bag into a victory . there is more dancing , u h you know football is mostly about dancing . there ' s some other stuff like sometimes it turns into soccer for a little bit and they bring on a soccer player to do that , but mostly it ' s about dancing and speaking , which are two of my favorite activities . wo w ! no wonder i love football . this has been sports news . nazr and frances made the night as romantic as they could . they lit candles , because the risk of house fires is of course very romantic . they had flowers on the table , because the reminder of how plants grow is considered a great aphrodisiac among people who get really revived up about plants . neither nazr or frances were one of those people , but still , it could not hurt . ` ` it ' s not too late , '' she said . ` ` we could still be together . '' this did not help the romantic mood . ` ` we could not , '' he said . ` ` what would we become if we caused so much loss , just for our own petty happiness ? '' ` ` is that what this is ? '' she said . ` ` petty ? '' ` ` no , '' he said , ` ` it ' s just ... what is not petty against the span of all of it ? '' ` ` to me , '' she said , ` ` you are not . you are not . '' but he could not be persuaded . she gave up and instead , she kissed him . he had never felt such a kiss , because he had never before kissed anyone out of a quiet and desperate grief . i do not recommend that context to any of my listeners , but it does make for one hell of a kiss . then she left his house . nazr sat all night with the decision they had made . it was the correct decision . but if that was true , then why did he feel so completely like a person buried under rocks or locked into a cell with no light for months ? he felt as though he would never take another free breath of air . there was no longer an other version of himself in his home , but it also felt to him that perhaps there was no one in his home . that the version of himself that was a human being existed only in the past tense , and from here on out , there was only this quotation of nazr . and out of context except stripped of meaning . he stood for a while before walking down to his car and pulling it out of the garage . it was almost morning . the radio shock was not open and packed with technology-craving customers yet , so he park ed there and walked the rest of the way up to the humming spire . he fell to his knees . this was not his decision to make , but he had already made the decision . ` ` brown stone spire , '' he said . ` ` i ' ve made my choice . destroy the other universe . i have to be with her , no matter what . '' the spire did not reply . ` ` please , '' he shouted . he slapped his palms against the hard packed earth again and again until they stung . ` ` please , i ' ve decided ! destroy the other universe ! '' the spire hummed to life . ` ` it is done , '' said a voice from deep in its core . nazr , murderer of billions , walked away slowly toward his car . the ending of our story coming up . but hey , let ' s check in on today ' s weather . at first , nazr walked with shame . but what use , after all , was shame ? he had done what he had done so he and the woman he loved could live together in happiness . it would be a waste of everything , the worst of all possible outcome , if he had agreed to such a monstrous price , only to have any possible renumerative happiness ruined by the guilt of what he had done . he made the decision then and there to leave it behind him . by the time he had reached his car , still waiting in the radio shock parking lot as if nothing of import had happened in the intervening minutes . he had set aside the choice as a matter of the past , and started to feel the first spark of joy in his heart . for the last few weeks , he had felt a strangeness , which he now knew was the feeling of falling out of step with reality . and now , the feeling was gone . he felt human again . he started the car , drove directly to frances ' house . he could not wait to see her . he had never felt such a complete hunger for another person , but it ' s possible no one in all of history had ever paid such a price to be with another person . and there was that person before him , tending to her garden in the cool morning sun . he did not think about a universe and everyone in it , including another version of frances who no longer existed . he thought about this frances . he watched her for a long moment from his car , feeling a blissful lack of urgency . they had a life together . what would a few more minutes be ? so he let those minutes pass , watching her work , and then he stepped out of the car and approached her . she looked up with a smile . ` ` hiya , '' she said . ` ` i did it , '' he said . ` ` i went to the spire and i did it . '' he realized he was crying , but he was also smiling . she frowned , stood , took a step back . ` ` did what ? '' she said . ` ` what do you mean i - , '' he said . ` ` i made the choice , you were right . '' she held the slippers in front of her , not quite towards him , but not quite not . ` ` sorry , '' she said . ` ` maybe this is something that the other frances would understand ? i suppose a certain confusion was going to be unavoidable , but i do wish you d calm down . '' ` ` the other frances ? in the other universe ? '' he did not know what was going on . ` ` sure , '' she said . ` ` sweet lady , or is that modest ? anyway , she told me that she asked the brown stone spire to take her back to her own universe where i had been stuck . she said we had gotten mixed up , and things were not working out for her here . so she showed me how to come back to my world and she went back to hers . she said at least we d have a chance at happiness this way . she also said he hoped you were as nice in her world as you are in ours . '' she eyed nazr ' s sweat face , the desperate lean of his posture . ` ` are you nice , nazr ? '' ` ` she went back , '' he said . not a question but a surrender . ` ` to her world . to her ... universe . '' ` ` yes , '' said a frances who barely knew him at all . ` ` now i ' m sorry , but i do want to get back to my gardening . '' nazr returned to his car , but had nowhere he wanted to go . he watched the frances who was not his frances , but she glared at him , so he drove aimlessly and stopped again . his frances was gone , along with er entire universe . before hew as aware of it , he was already shouting . ` ` please , let me reverse it ! '' he shouted . ` ` please take it back ! '' barks ennui , in his awkward 3-dimensional body , was sitting on the passenger seat . ` ` there is no taking it back , '' said barks . ` ` but i will make you a one-time offer . if you like , i will let you join her in oblivion . it is not mere death , it is an absolute ceasing of existence , forever . b lip , and you ' ll be gone . do you want this ? '' nazr looked into the dog ' s distended eyes . he looked and looked . two weeks later , he returned to school . he went back to football , redoubled his dedication to his team . a complete focus on football may not be much of a life to many folks , but it is a life . there are many different kinds of life , and most of them are nothing special at all . frances , a different woman quite literally from the one we started this story with , continued to run the antique mall . what delighted her most was how objects existed here , in the moment , that everything existed all at once , right now . she loved the present . she thought little about tie . outside her window , a plane passed overhead . no one watched ist passing . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : we regret to inform you that this entire podcast series has been vital marketing for dipping ' dots . we do not think we made that obvious enough and we ' re panic king a little . please tell someone to try dipping ' dots today . we are going to be in so much trouble .
WTNV|A Door Ajar Part 1|15 March 2018|anxiety is just your body ' s way of telling you something really , really terrible is about to happen . welcome to night vale . three bodies were found behind the pancake house this morning . oh sorry , i did not mean to sound so shipper , it must be the coffee , i just started caffein again . dover ! three bodies were found behind the pancake house this morning . the cause of death has been identified as drowning . as you know , this is particularly un settling because the pancake house does not border any body of water , nor does any body of water exist in night vale . salt water and bl obs of semi-animate clear jelly were found in the lungs of the victims , according to reports from coroner lorelei avare . avare added that their clothing was sal ty to the taste . the victims were discovered by a truck driver identified only as enormous jim , who pulled into the pancake house parking lot around 6:30 this morning . ` ` i knew something was not right , '' jim said in his statement to the secret police . ` ` i felt warm all over and kind of singly , and i thought the fly larva had finally hatched in my hair . i got out of my truck and tried to s wat the larva , but there was no larva there . and i was sad because i missed its company . that ' s when i noticed what a beautiful sunrise we were having , so i stood and watched it for a while . you know that beautiful moment when you ca not tell the difference between orange and violet and the clouds look like sleeping gods ? that ' s when i noticed those dead bodies lying by the wall . '' oh enormous jim added , ` ` it was a beautiful noiseless sunrise . i wish the larva could have seen it . '' jim ' s forehead was lined with sweat trails and his hands fluttered along his shirt buttons like cabinet keys . he explained in a shak y voice that he was hauling turning from a farm in the south to a pulp factory in the north , where they would be turned into much and used to grow more turning . he said he had a tight schedule to keep , and that he had nothing to do with any of this . and since lying is illegal , the sheriff ' s secret police released him from further questioning . the victims have not yet been identified , but each held match ing promotion al coupon , good for one free hot cake at the pancake house . the coupon stated they could only be used once per table , per visit . it is unclear whether the victims intended to sit at several tables and pretend no to know each other , in order to use all three coupon in the same visit . this is a developing story . in related news , the pancake house is having a grand reopening . it ' s been closed down since the sandstone of ' 97 buried it under 200 tons of sand . it resurfaced in ' 08 full of scorpions , who reopened the din er under the name arachnid hut . it disappeared again in ' 09 , after the scorpions filed chapter 7. no one could see the pancake house anymore , but if they walked at op the seemingly plain du ne , they would run into a hard surface that felt exactly like a wall . teenager who had scratch heart-swaddled initials into the invisible concrete blocks could still feel the impression of their things suspended in the nothingness . and the area continued to smell of has h br owns for a radius of nearly a mile . anyway , it ' s back and under new , probably human ownership , and will hopefully be here to stay . ah , so many memories from that place ! back in the 90 ' s , my friends and i would hang out there for all night sometimes . there was a young woman who sat in the corner booth and analyzed people ' s dreams for a dollar . i once told her about this recurring nightmare i have where i am a pineapple farmer , but i have to grow each pineapple under a glass bottle . and when the pineapples grow big , the bottles break and i ' m left standing in a field of broken glass . and sometimes when i woke up , i had little cuts all over the bottoms of my feet . i do not remember what the woman said it means , but i found out later that she was nina gordon , frontperson for alternative rock band verruca salt . there was a lot of great memorabilia in the pancake house , like old postcard and chromic chickens with human fingers for eyes , and this cool antique jukebox that would automatically play bud dy holly ' s ` ` every day '' when someone in town was about to day . i loved that place ! oh , we ' ve just received word from the coroner ' s office that more saltpeter has been discovered , this time in the pot holes near the controversial new roundabout in old town . avare also found bl obs of clear jelly floating there , similar to those found in the lungs of the drowning victims . samples of these bl obs were collected by a girl scout splinter faction known as the onya fist , and brought to the marine biology association for further examination . a girl scout member and apparent leader of the onya fist named brandy lance said , ` ` we knocked on the marine biologist ' s door and heard muffled shouts and loud crash es coming from inside . then the blinds closed and the lights went out ! when we forced our way in using telekinesis - i earned my mountain mo ver badge last year – we heard the backdoor slam shut . the only thing we found inside was a scribbled note that said : ` ` closed for the day '' . but it was just lying on the floor , not posted anywhere . brandy said her troupe will not rest until they track and locate the missing geologists . good luck , kid s ! we ' ll be waiting for your up dates . and now traffic . as i mentioned earlier there is a controversial new traffic roundabout in old town . the problem is , no one knows how a roundabout works . if you go to the right if you should go to the left , your head lights explode . if you go left when you should go right , you get a phone call that one of your family members is in the hospital . if you hesitate , a stranger dies . and if you just keep going , you ' ll never stop . you ' re never , ever , ever stop . you ' ll drive endless ly , aging at a steady rate , watching the terrain change , the seasons pass and you ' ll wonder , ` ` have i ever stopped ? have i ever stood still or slept , or sat in a chair that was not hurling ceaselessly into the future ? '' the emergency almonds you keep in the glove compartment can only sustain you for so long . what happens then ? there ' s only like , 15 of them in an airline bag , and you ' ve never been on a plane . where did you get them ? are they safe to eat ? they ' ve been in there a really long time . probably since you got the car . maybe they came with the car . you ' ve started to forget things like your name and where you bought this car . was it at a leadership or from someone on craigslist ? did you build the car yourself or manifest it with your mind ? you find the owner ' s manual , but you ca not read it for some reason . it ' s either in another language or you ' ve lost the ability to read . the letters rearrange themselves and fall off the page . your leg is burning where the letter l has landed on your knee . l , l ! you remember the letter l , at least there ' s that . this has been traffic . update on the drowning story . the victims have been identified as the taylor family who reportedly have not come out of their house in nine years . annette , the adult daughter of the family , st il has braces from when she was 13. she just never returned to the orthodontist to get them removed . it ' s possible that hot cakes from the pancake house were the only this she could eat anymore . you know come to think of it , 11 years ago was the lats time when the pancake house was open . there are noooo coincidences . or , everything is a coincidence . or , only some things are . yeah , those are the three possibilities . an independent consultant has determined that the saltpeter samples are oceanic in nature . this has secret police investigator crumbling to find where the ocean is located . one of them suggested north , and the consultant began walking in that direction . the investigator wanted to determine if the ocean is a continuing threat , and whether or not they ' re allowed under state and physical law to apprehend it on charges of man slaughter . law enforcement and volunteer search parties are forming to seek justice for the traylors , although no one remembers every interact ing with them before . but everyone cares , really cares a lot suddenly . the silver lining in events lie these is the togetherness it brings to a community , right before the paranoia and blameshifting sets in and divides it further into an ever-widening chasm , but let ' s just try to enjoy the unity while we have it . ooh , speaking of togetherness : it looks like carlos has brought a picnic lunch for us to eat here at the station . aww , what a nice surprise , hon ! now while i look into this basket of goodies , let ' s check in with the weather . that was weird . carlos came in , as i mentioned , with a lovely picnic lunch from the ralph ' s de li counter . his hair was wet from the rain and there were water droplets on the tips of his eyelashes that made him look like a cut e little cartoon forest animal . the phone rang here at the station , and it was one of carlos ' scientists , mark , asking if carlos was here . carlos made a wild hand gesture and shook his head vigorously , so i told mark that he was not . when i asked carlos what that was all about , he told me the scientists were putting together a group t locate clues about the phantom ocean , and they wanted him to lead it . and i was confused . did not he want to lead it ? i mean why did not he want to talk to them ? he ' s never refused a scientific call from a fellow scientist to do science before . he was just behaving unscientifically . in fact , come to think of it , i was a bit surprised to see carlos here at all . i-i mean i figured with today ' s investigation , he would already be out in the field , and i would not see him for days . he said , since everyone else was out on search parties , it was the perfect time to go to the ralph ' s , because there would not be a line . i mean , that does sound scientific , it sounds like scientific reasoning but a- but ( that ) , just something struck me about it as , i dun no , just off . i mean i do not wan na say he was lying . carlos does not lie . besides , lying is illegal . but it seemed like there was something he was not telling me , like something that was bothering him . i asked him if there was anything he wanted to talk about , and he just said he had to go get the car washed and he left without even finishing his three-bean salad , and he loves that salad , made with his three favorite beans : garbanzo , kidney , and jelly . i mean i know , i know , it might not sound like a big deal and maybe he was just having a moment . we all have moods , sometimes out of nowhere . you know , maybe i ' m the one in a weird mood . i ' m probably just being overlay sensitive . i ' m sure nothing is really wrong , not actually . anyway you know , let ' s just move on , i ' m sure it ' s fine . everything is fine . it ' s fine . maybe i should go off caffein again ? no , you know what , i really ca not shake this feeling . nina gordon , the former frontperson of verruca salt once told me that the unconscious is a powerful force . maybe it ' s all in my unconscious . maybe if things are too good for too long , and you think about it too hard , it can start to make you nervous . and then , maybe you ca not take the pressure of waiting for things to wrong , and you start inventing problems just so you can have control over them . but you have to think about whatever can go wrong . otherwise , you ' re lazily enjoying a sunrise and dreaming of free hot cakes , and suddenly you ' re drowning in a fatherless parking lot before you even know what hit you . no , this is silly ! i ' m just go n na call him . ok . ringing ... ringing ... no answer . not unusual , really . he ' s probably at the car wash like he said . which can be very hypnotics . you know , sometimes you find yourself caught up in the rhythmic dance of the foaming brush , and you wake up in the parking lot hours later missing your wallet and part of your shirt , dry-mouthed and trying to remember how many teeth you have . oh good ! i ' ve just been handed some breaking news to distract me . oh , oh . well this is actually just a press release for the grand reopening of the pancake house . well , a press release is definitely a form of breaking news . they are announcing their new weekly menu special . quote : ` ` we here at the pancake house acknowledge that time is circular . like a roundabout , not an unfathomable endless line with no beginning or end . we like repetition . it ' s comforting . we know what ' s behind us , and what ' s ahead , and what will come again . it means there are certain truths , no matter what else may happen . in honor of our innate preference for cyclical thinking , we can guarantee that every monday , fluffy omelet will be on special . every tuesday , we will have corn beef has h . no matter what happens , there will be liver and onions on wednesday . you can lose your job and have your car possessed on thursday and still know that there will be chicken fingers on special that night like clockwork . we often think of friday was being better than other days . for this reason , if something bad happens on a friday , it can be particularly disappointing . you wo not be disappointed by our ham patties . they are consistent and dependable . saturday we are here for you with liver and onions again . on sunday , you can rely on our fried eggs and toast points . they will provide you with wavering support , even if something really bad happens . even if you do not know what you ' re doing at all anymore . even if all the buildings suddenly seem planted to the right by a few degrees , and everything that used to look yellow now smells yellow . you can always come to the pancake house , no matter what happens . '' ah , well that ' s a nice sentiment ! oo it also has a coupon attached here . ` ` good for one free hot cake , one per table per visit . '' that ' s very nice . ok , i ' m just go n na try and call carlos again . straight to voicemail this time . well , that happens . everything ' s fine . he always forgets to charge his phone , iii tease him about it . you know , i like to buy him different novelty phone chargers and hide them in his jacket and car , and in his shoes and lunch bag , but still he forgets . he has a very busy mind . maybe he does not like me to tease him so much . maybe i ' m overthinking . maybe it ' s just too much coffee . or maybe i ' ll head down to the pancake house for dinner . let ' s it ' s thursday so let ' s see . chicken fingers ! or there ' s always the hot cake coupon . maybe i ' ll see some of you down there . that would be nice . or maybe you already have plans , which is totally fine too . i ' ll just see you some other time . it ' s no big deal . everything ' s fine . i need more coffee . stay tuned next for the sound of someone distracting you while you ' re driving , and then yelling that you missed the turn . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : bite your tongue . fun , right ?
WTNV|A Door Ajar Part 2|1 April 2018|when one door closes , another opens . that ' s why there are so many raccoons living in your house . welcome to night vale . the phantom ocean has struck again . last night around 2 am , a horrible splintering sound was heard across town . many residents awakened exclaiming : ` ` what was that horrible splintering sound ? '' many others who heard it shrieked : ` ` i heard nothing ! nothing at all ! '' flickering lights splashed against the desert sky . the lights moved into the neighborhoods forming dark shapes across walls and streets . shapes which moaned and shuffled as if wounded . a confused seagull cried out for sandwich crusts in the dark . big rico , owner of big rico ' s pizza , neither heard the splintering sound nor saw the lights . he was awakened instead by a soft knocking at the door of his home . believing the knocking to be part of his recurring dream where he is driving a pizza delivery car eternally down a dark suburban street , looking for an address that does not exist . he tried to get back to sleep , not wanting to end such a pleasant fantasy . the knocking grew more insistent . rico groaned his way to the living room half asleep , and was confronted by a bedraggled group of entities in rain slippers , who appeared to be in trouble . though they did not speak a language known to big rico , the leader of the group who we now know as the captain , managed to explain the situation by drawing an entire graphics novel on old pizza boxes . the images told the story of a doomed sailing vessel that met with misfortune when the ocean disappeared from underneath it . and it was dashed to pieces against solid earth . the confused sailors had gathered themselves from the desert floor , gotten together torches and supplies , and journeyed approximately eight blocks to civilization . the secret police confirmed the story after finding the wreck age of a wooden sailing ship in the scrublands earlier this morning . illegally park ed nearby was a silver 2011 mi ni cooper with an open sun roof filled to the brim of salt water and bl obs of translucent jelly . if this is your vehicle , please pick it up immediately . looking at you , susan tillman . after being physically coerced by the secret police , several ca ring families in night vale have volunteered their homes to these sailors . the captain , doctor shouty , old wood teeth , rebecca , and the really tall one . we will be checking in with some of these families periodically for up dates on how things are going . brandy lance , behavior science expert of the girl scouts ' splinter faction , the onya fist , believes there was a mutiny in progress before the shipwreck even occurred . a theory that was substantiate by today ' s exceedingly awkward welcome breakfast at the pancake house . rebecca and old wood teeth spoke only in grumbling undertones , periodically telling doctor shouty to hush , while the captain sat far across the restaurant and pensively stirred his clam crowder . bitter looks were exchanged between all parties . but eating together in suffocating silence does not necessarily mean anything is wrong . for example , since carlos did not want to go to the welcome breakfast , we had a quiet meal at home . like really , really quiet . i told him his scientist friends nilanjana and mark had called , again , to ask about organizing a case study on the shipwreck survivor . he got the strangest look on his face and said he was really busy with another project right now . i asked him what he was working on and he said oh you know , and then made the universal hand gesture for science . then he kissed me on the cheek , washed his plate , and disappeared into his home lab . later i heard the muffled screams of a sit com laugh track from behind the closed door . meanwhile , in light of recent happiness , the night vale tourism board along with the business association , has announced plans for a massive expansion of the harbor waterfront project . this has been met with protest from the marine biology association , who are intensely opposed to encouraging the existence of an ocean in a desert . in response , madeline fleur of the tourism board issued the following statement at an emergency town hall meeting . ` ` we believe expanding the waterfront project will bring forth new opportunity and added value to this great city . just because we do not know how , when , or where the ocean appears , and have literally zero control over its behavior , does not mean we ca not get at least profit from sightseers . '' the agitated marine geologists responded : ` ` that ' s stupid ! you ' re stupid ! '' to which annette mahaka , head of the business association , responded in a whining tone : ` ` why ca not you just let us be happy ? '' fleur added in a much deeper , more authoritative tone : ` ` plunging ahead without considering the consequences is one of the maverick values this great land was founded on . '' this last statement was met with thunderous applause . based entirely on her tone of voice , rather than the actual words spoken . despite the conflict around this issue , there is something i admire about each party ' s ability to clearly state their positions . there ' s no confusion about either side ' s feelings . they can express their concerns and move on from there . or maybe they ' ll end up deadlocked in stalemate , repeating the same phrases continuously until they cease to convey actual meaning . but at least they know where they stand . comprehension without flexibility is so important when resolving conflict . let ' s have a look at other local news . the first annual fishermen ' s stew contest , sponsored by the night vale urinary society , has named a winner : john peters - you know , the farmer - won with his five ingredient corn crowder recipe made with invisible corn , hot water , cold water , kocher salt , and swedish fish . also , night vale community college has its first ever nobel prize winner . ta ra area won the coveted award for her work in mathematical poetry , with the following hair coup let : you keep the drawer locked where all five sharp knives are sta shed . but now it ' s open . you live alone right , and did not use any knives ? but now there ' s just four . ta ra has a fine future in the mathematical poetry trades . ah , speaking of the community college , i think that i am overdue to give another guest lecture there . it ' s been – wo w , u m , over five years ? i know because it was back when carlos first got to town . i was walking down the hall on my way to the communications department , and i saw him standing there talking to a group of people in hushed scientific tones . our eyes met for a second as i walked by , and he gave me a cordial nod . his perfect hair shimmering , almost indigo under the fluorescent lighting . later , after my lecture , i went back to that halfway , and it was empty . but then i hears his voice . he was talking to someone in an office a few doors down . i wanted to hide , i was so giddy and nervous , but then he was in the all again . and before i could speak he said , ` ` hey , you like science ? '' my mouth did not work so i nodded and he said , ` ` you wan na see something scientific ally interesting ? '' we went up the back staircase to the earth sciences building roof , and he pointed toward a field at the edge of town . there was a hay column of darkness stretching from the middle of the field into the sky . ` ` what is that ? '' i asked . carlos told me he was not sure , but it could only be seen from this exact angle and distance . we took two steps to the side and it was gone . we took two steps back to the left , our feet in perfect unison , a tilted little barn dance , and we could see the dark column again . ` ` that is scientific ally interesting , '' i said , not sure if i was overselling my level of scientific interest . i told him , ` ` you can also see my apartment building from here . it ' s always there . it does not disappear . '' and he asked , ` ` which one is it ? '' and i showed him and he said , ` ` that has a nice roof , good singles . '' it was the first compliment he ever gave me . and then he had to go to a meeting and i went home . it was a while before we spoke again , but i used to think of that moment often . you know , i ' m go n na think of it again now . and while i do , you should think about the weather . let ' s check in with our host families to see how some of our nautical residents are adjusting . doctor shouty and rebecca have gone to live in a barista commune , learning secrets of coffee making . such as , the only difference between a latte and a flat white is 50 cents . and memorizing the incorrect spelling of every single human name . old wood teeth lives with the allay family , herself , tuck and their daughter megan , who is an adult hand sewn onto a tall russian submariner . megan showed old wood teeth photo of submarines , and he did not believe that they were real , so she rented crimson tide , and while it did not change old wood teeth ' s beliefs , he ' s now boy-crazy over denzel washington and does not understand how denzel did not win an oscar for malcolm x. i have a report here from my brother-in-law , steve carlsberg . the palmer-carlsberg family is ho sting the really tall one . now the really tall one is proving to be a calming presence in the household , and has even taught the family nautical dancing , sailing dirges in her native tongue , and how to read ancient star charts that were used to accurately navigable the globe long before maps and gas . janice , my teenage niece , has shown the really tall one which remote controls are for the blu-ray player , and which are for the surround sound . my sister abby has noted a strong odor that seems like a combination of ozone , copper , and shrimp permeating the house whenever the really tall one is asleep . the odor gets stronger the deeper into unconsciousness the really tall one is . other host families have also reported this phenomenon , but have been quick to add that it ' s totally not a complaint , you know just a , just an observation . unfortunately we ' ve learned that the captain , who was being host ed by witness protection resident sigrid b org due to the extra levels of security in her apartment , has been reported missing . sigrid released a statement saying : ` ` please stop telling people i ' m in the witness protection program ! '' we ' ll keep our eyes out for him , sigrid . i ' m getting word now that the conflict between the tourism board and the marine geologists has excavated . the geologists have discovered what appears to be a makeshift aquarium being hidden in a 12-by-12 public storage unit in ra don canyon . the secret aquarium consists of several tanks containing bl obs of semi-animate clear jelly , likely taking from the lungs of the ( tailors ) , the rucksack of girl scouts ' splinter faction leader , ran dy lance , the pot holes in old town , and/or susan tillman ' s mi ni cooper . the geologists also discovered plans for a more complete aquarium , once the funding for the expanded waterfront project comes through . to which the geologists cried out : ` ` over our dead bodies ! ` ` , averting nearby tourism board entries of their presence . a verbal altercation took place , with both sides speaking over one another at louder and louder volumes , eventually erupting into awkward grab by physical violence . it ended when their roughhousing tumbled most of the scufflers into the canyon . the remaining geologists have chosen a more non-violent approach , instead marching through town waving signs warning of impending doom and chanting rhymes . madeline fleur of the tourism board responded on public access television that most night vale residents support waterfront development . several have even submitted their own ideas for store fronts , fleur claimed . like one of those places where you write your name on a friable and huff paint . or a savory taffy stand . or a mysterious warehouse , which appears abandoned but sometimes you hear clanging sounds inside . oh , hang on listeners , someone is knocking on my studio door . that ' s weird , i ' m not expecting anybody . oh , maybe it ' s carlos ! oh i ' m sorry everybody , just let me ... oh , u m ... ok , the captain has entered the studio . he ' s wild-eyed and he ' s making theatre hushing motion with his finger . oh , and now he ' s hiding underneath my desk . oh , and now my phone is ringing . ok , this is a lot happening at once , i had better deal with this . u h , listen to this pre-recorded p sa while i figure things out . deb : hello night vale ! this is deb , a sentiment patch of haze , speaking for the department of motor vehicles . when it comes times to renew or apply for your driver ' s license , please remember to check the eyeball donation box on the back of the form . contrary to those nasty rumors , it does not authorize a representative of the dmv to break into your house at night and remove your eyeball while you sleep . huh , usually . those days are , for the most part long behind us . it does mean you have the chance to be a hero in one of the many eye-claiming accidents that disproportionately affect residents of our fair city each year . say you get into a car accident and die . say someone else who was in that accident is alive , but no longer has any eyes . your eyeball will be removed from your face and placed into that person ' s face . then , that person not only regains the power of sight , but you do as well . your consciousness , which lives inside your eyeball ' s posterior chamber , will remain intact , seeing everything your host body sees , experiencing whatever they experience , throughout the rest of their life . and of course , if that person gets into a fatal accident later , both of your consciousness will remain , as your eyeball are transferred to a third party . in this way , it is technically possible to gain immortality . so please , remember to check that box on the back of the form . thanks , friends ! cecil : i ' m sorry about that , i was , i was greeting the captain and then my phone rang and it was carlos and he wanted to meet me on the roof of the earth sciences building and watch the sunset together over the column of hay darkness ! a purely romantic gesture . it ' s somewhat out of character for carlos , but i did not feel like questioning it . i ' m just grateful he finally seemed willing to open up . you know , i did not realize how much it ' s been getting to me until talking to him just now . whew ! i mean i know i have not resolved or even fully understood what ' s been bothering me , but i feel relieved anyway . tentatively revealed . no no , i feel revealed . i mean , why frame positive things with the fear of losing them ? so closing tonight ' s broadcast a little early . i ' m sure you ' ll understand . station management wo not , which is why i ' ve set up a cecil-shaped mannequin i made out of burlap , twine , and dried lentils to place in my chair for the final few segments of the show . you know , maybe i can get the captain to help me secure the ... oh , oh my god i forgot about the captain ! he must have stuck out of here while i was on the phone . oh yeah , yeah i can see him through the window . he ' s climbed up to the top of our radio tower and is looking thou a spyglass , gesturing frantically at the horizon . and he ' s crying out : ` ` we are doomed , we are all doomed '' . oh man , he ' s go n na blow my cover . ok , if i ' m go n na speak out of work , i need to do it now . he ' s an eccentric fellow , that captain . sigrid b org , i know you ' re trying to keep a low profile , what with your participation in the witness protection program . but please come to the station and collect your house guest . susan tillman , your mi ni cooper has been to wed . alright ! stay tuned next for a cecil-shaped mannequin made up of burlap , twine , and dried lentils reading you the latest on traffic and the community calendar . good night , night vale , good night ! today ' s proverb : i believe in tough love . also , tough tenderness , tough vulnerability , and a daily session of tough sinfulness meditation .
WTNV|A Door Ajar Part 3|15 April 2018|always keep your eyes closed during a storm . otherwise your soul will get all wet and mildewy . welcome to night vale . i hate sounding like a news media alarm ist , but a phantom ocean has completely destroyed old town . i mean , destroyed . wave after wave of cold bring has entirely swept away the old town draw bridge . which is a shame , because the city made considerable strides towards its completion in recent years . also missing : a number of cars , pets , human beings , and the entering stack of bath tubs that granted wishes . a more complete list of the missing items has been posted at the newly reopened pancake house . come on down to the pancake house , check if any of your loved ones have been affected by this horrible disaster , and enjoy free hot cakes . one free hot cake per missing loved one . the surviving residents of old town have been placed with compulsory volunteer host families throughout the rest of town . many of the survivor of the recent shipwreck have finally been placed in their own permanent housing , and are now ho sting flood victims . having experienced recent displacement themselves , the really tall one , dr . shouty , old wood teeth , rebecca , and the captain are proving to be elegant hosts , and have been reported to supply slipper socks , steamed hand towels and all natural calamari favored toothpaste to their guests . this generosity has put many night vale residents , who initially complained about ho sting the shipwreck survivor , to shame . you know who you are , and so do we . there ' s a list of those who should be ashamed of themselves posted at the newly reopened pancake house . sometimes i get really tired of negative reporting . as the most prominent voice in local current events , i feel like what i say and how i say it does make a difference in framing the attitudes of the people who listen . that , that ' s a big responsibility . so i ' ve been thinking , it ' s important to focus on the positive things too . i ' m go n na try to do that more . starting now . what i said before was an exaggeration . old town is not completely destroyed . oh yes , it ' s uninhabitable , and some people who live there are now non-living . but there ' s a lot of beauty left there , too ! i mean , one might look over old town from the roof of the earth sciences building and appreciate the miles of pristine , shining water . water we desert-dwellers never get to see ! all of the tragedy and destruction is almost totally invisible beneath the waves , so it ' s actually pretty easy to ignore . oh , and one architectural landmarks does remain . the controversial new traffic roundabout is glowing with blue light , and can be seen just below the water line , and will be ready to use again ... soon . speaking of the roof of the earth sciences building , i should tell you guy s what happened with carlos the other night . it went really well , mostly . i mean , he was very open about the fact that he ' s been hiding something from me , but he said it was not a big deal and he does not want to talk about it . i know i said all i wanted was for him to admit something was bothering him , and that him pretending nothing was wrong was really what was driving me crazy . but it turns out that was not true . now i ' m being driven crazy by not knowing what it is . i mean , what if it ' s about me ? even if it ' s not about me directly , the fact that he does not feel comfortable telling me it has to be a problem with us , does not it ? we ' re supposed to share everything with each other , are not we ? i could not let it go , so i finally asked him to see a couples counselor with me . the really tall one , who until last week had been staying with my sister and her husband , got her counselling license last week , so we ' re going to see her . i even get a discount since she ' s become so close to my niece janice . we have our first phone session together schedule for later today . i ' m , i ' m really hoping we can get to the bottom of this so i can stop obsessing ! i mean , and also so carlos can let go of whatever is distracting him so much , and then we can both get back to distracting each other . the emotional complexities of sharing a life with another are all that ' s on my mind . also , the sudden ocean which destroyed old town . oh , breaking news on that : all members of the marine biology association have been reported missing . ran dy lance , girl scouts splinter faction leader , reports that the gas track ing devices she secretly adhered to the geologists ' shoe heels have stopped transmitting , and no one has seen any of the geologists in over 24 hours . members of the tourism board have declined verbal comment , instead offering a giddy smile while waving a giant foam number 1 finger . and with no geologists to throw a antrum about menacing biohazards hidden in an un secured lock er , members of the tourism board have gone out to the storage unit in ra don canyon to re locate their secret aquarium of semi-animate clear jelly collected from our new ocean to a more public venue . making our flooding situation even worse is the hard rain . on the bright side , we do not normally get much rain around these parts . the gentle percussion of water is so soothing ! it reminds me of my new sleep meditation track , bloodstorm . more on the weather in a moment , but first an update from ra don canyon . i ' ve received word that the bl obs of semi-animate translucent jelly in the tourism board ' s aquarium have fused together to form one giant jelly cub e that now completely fills the 12 foot by 12 foot storage unit from wall to wall . horrifically unnerved by this discovery , agents from the tourism board who went to recover the aquarium have all left ra don canyon and hired the really tall one for private therapy sessions . head of the tourism board , madeline fleur , released a statement which only said : ` ` well crap '' . fleur was last seen in full sprint toward the airport . and now , a p sa . deb : hello friends . this is deb , a sentiment and occasionally benevolent , patch of haze . speaking for the department of motor vehicles . we ' ve had some complaints about our eyeball donation program . we want to emphasize we created this program with only the best intentions . we ' re sure you understand that . according to a survey , people in the donation program have been very satisfied they can retain some sort of consciousness after death . however , they have been reportedly very unsatisfied with what their eyes continue to see . this has ranged from nonconsensual television viewing in the middle of a season they ' re not caught up with , to the witness ing of crimes and subsequent ethical dilemma of testify ing in court against their own host bodies . we hear your concerns . and you know what ? fine . the eyeball donation check box will be discontinued on all new dmv forms . the dmv itself has also been discontinued . if you need any services from the dmv , please go to another town . please do not call or come to the office . if you see any dmv workers around town , please do not speak to them or acknowledge their presents . it ' s obvious you do not like them . it will only make this harder for all of us . we think a little space would be good for us right now . but we do want you to know we were only trying to something nice . we care deeply about our dmv customers and have only wanted the best for you . we know that does not make it right , but no matter what , just remember : the dmv loves you . the dmv has always loved you . that ' s the important thing . if we could afford the rights to that green day song , we d play . good knowing you . love , the dmv . cecil : i want to get back to the carlos stuff , listeners . i really need to talk this all out , but i keep getting breaking news up dates . we finally have word on the missing geologists . that ' s good news . we found them out in the scrublands . the bad news is we were only able to find partially eaten pieces of them . with the leadership of the marine biologist association vacated , ran dy lance declared herself and the girl scouts splinter faction as the city ' s foremost experts in marine biology . lance surmises there is an asiatic creature of large tooth size and invariable hunger living in this new ocean . lance speculated the geologists were engaged in a heroic attempt to study the marine biology abruptly available to them , when events took a tragic turn . the geologists ' loved ones clarified that the geologists were actually fleeing town under the cover of night and got caught in the worst possible intersect ion of time and space , dying an agonized and terror-filled death in the exact matter that comprise their worst collective nightmare . ` ` he died doing what he loved , '' a spouse of one of the deceased said . ` ` running away from his problems . '' oh , oh look at the time ! that ' s carlos and the really tall one calling in for our first counselling session . u m , oo , probably a good time for a weather report . well , that was an interesting first counselling session . carlos apologized for being so quiet recently , and i said it was ok , i was just worried about him , and the really tall one said we both sounded like we loved each other a lot . and i said , well yes but that ' s not the point right now , the point is i want to know all of carlos ' secrets ! and carlos said , ` ` cecil , if it really means that much to you , i ' ll tell you . the truth is , this is not my first phantom ocean . before i ever came to night vale , there was an incident . it happened years ago , it was a different situation , but similar enough that i got preoccupied thinking about it these last few weeks . and sometimes i just need a little space to process things on my own first . it does not mean i ' m hiding anything from you . i mean , i kind of am , but if it were truly serious or was directly about us , i would talk with you about it . this is just a scientific and catastrophe phenomenon , not something to do with us . '' that is verbatim what carlos said . i wrote down every exact word , like an inexperienced journalist carefully investigation a huge story . and then i said , ` ` yes ok fine , but what happened ? what incident ? '' and – he said he still did not really want to talk about it and i asked the really tall one , ` ` are not there some sort of therapy exercised we could do to encourage carlos to reveal every detail of his past to us immediately ? '' and she said ` ` no '' . and i said , ` ` maybe hypnosis or telekinesis ? '' i mean , she ' s new to the counselling profession and maybe is not aware of all the tools available to be her yet . she said we have to accept that carlos does not want to talk about it right now , and maybe does not want to talk about it ever . she said a person ' s secrets are their own to keep or disclose and it is not necessarily an indication of the degree of intimacy in a relationship . and i said , ` ` oh , really ? tell that to my th grade self ! '' immediately embarrassed , i doubled down and said , ` ` i played truth or dare and revealed to my friends that i ' m afraid of mirrors and that i have a crush on someone in the room . '' ` ` that ' s cut e ! '' carlos said . ` ` who was there ? '' and i said , ` ` i ca not tell you ! '' and then i said , ` ` i ca not remember , actually . '' i do not even remember what year i was in the th grade , let alone how old i am or even what i look like , because of the whole mirror thing . but i did not want to tell carlos all that . it was too painful and complicated and not important . and the really tall one who could , i ' m sure , hear all of my thoughts , smiled over the phone , which i thought was s mug . i ' m still not sure how i feel about any of this . i have a lot more to say here , but there ' s been some breaking news up dates piling up on my desk . let ' s ski m through the most interesting looking ones . yeah . in order to protect us from the growing jelly cub e and its apparent power to create random phantom ocean , the city council decided the key to the jelly-filled storage unit in ra don canyon will be destroyed , fed to whatever asiatic beast ate the marine geologists . a new budget line item was then approved to pay monthly rent on the unit indefinitely rather than , quote , ` ` ever open that door again '' . this cost to the city will be covered by the new tax increases on rental cars , gasoline , and dreams where you realize you ' re naked in public . a memorial service was held for the remaining body parts of the members of the marine biology association . it was a beautiful service , in which each body part was given recognition for its unique contribution to the whole of who each person was . inspired by this touching memorial , as well as the silent horror finally locked away in ra don public storage , the tourism board has decided to abandon plans for the harbor waterfront expansion project . instead , it will shift its focus to renovation the recently destroyed old town . plans for new old town are already under way , with some blueprints taken from the children ' s re designed old town drawing contest , host ed by the girl scouts splinter faction . the captain is even slated to open a fusion restaurant there later this year . mmm , i love non-specific fusion cuisine . members of the tourism board have acknowledged that a huge amount of money and effort will go into the renovation and that all of the work , time , and expanse may or may not be destroyed by a similar incident at any moment . ` ` chest la vie '' , they were hard to utter . it ' s possible they actually said , ` ` se pa vediare '' , a protection spell that makes all sand eels harbingers of good fortune . mm , hm . ok , i only have a few moments of air time left , and i just wanted to say , well ... you know how if you keep staring at that one spot in the ceiling , it starts to look like a face ? and the harder you look , the more it takes shape , and when you can finally see it really clearly , the face never disappears and it ' s always there watching you ? or , or like how oxyclean has those commercial where they can get blood out of everything from jeans to gloves to loaves of bread , but when you actually use the product , those stains just never go away , reminding you day after day of what you ' ve done ? or , no , ok , anyway . what i ' m trying to say is carlos , if you ' re listening , i ' m sorry i creaked out and kept pressing you to talk . taking space for yourself is not the same as pushing someone away . and i guess i needed a little space too to figure that out . whatever you need , i totally respect that . i can even go hang out at the pancake house tonight if you - if you want some alone time . ok , i just wanted to say that before ... oh . oh , carlos just tested . ` ` come home now and i will do the opposite of push you away . '' well . maybe what i ' m trying to say is , i think i ' ve been on the air too long , i really should be getting home like right now . stay tuned next for bubble wrap being popped by rolling pins meant to simulate the explosion of fireworks . good night , night vale , good night ! today ' s proverb : pick a company and invest all your money in it . the absolute worst that could happen is that you ' ll lose every cent and it would be terrifying and life-changing , so give it a shot .
WTNV|A Matter of Blood Part 1|1 May 2018|sleep like there ' s nobody watching . welcome to night vale . mayor dana cardinal , now in her fourth year on the job , has gotten comfortable with the responsibilities and powers of the position . she issued a statement in casual conversation with your intrepid host just yesterday , while we happened to be next to each other in line at the missing frog salad bar . saying she believes she could bring about some lasting positive change with her position . as such , she will be instituting a number of programs to radically expand the power and oversight of the mayor , putting her directly in charge of the agents of the vague yet menacing government agency , who spy on her every moment , as well as the sheriff ' s secret police , who regulate our every waking breath . she said by taking on full control of all areas , she will be able to make sure everything is run more justly , more humane ly , and with less imprison ing dissidents for life in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town . but , she said , this change will be difficult for a lot of people , and so she asked me not to ... tell anyone just yet . loops . so this has been cecil ' s fiction corner , in which i write fan fiction about real people in town . none of that was true . onto actual news now . astronomers and astrologists alike were excited to announce we will soon experience a rare cosmological event . the blood matter from space ! once every 500 years , our region experiences blood matter from space , and experts believe this might be the largest such event in recorded night vale history . although specifying that with any certainty is tricky , the experts say . the problem is that most of recorded night vale history has been covered over with a floppy black ink scribble and the note : ` ` sorry , top secret . love , the government '' , scrawled on every page . sometimes those same government employees will arrive at important events while they ' re still happening , and start shoving wadded-up socks into people ' s mouths while shouting : ` ` lalalala i ca not hear you ! '' in order to get a jump on censuring history . anyway , for those space heads and star weeks who are excited by the up coming blood matter from space , it appears the best viewing will be from literally anywhere in the region . it ' s go n na come down hard on us , and there ' s no hiding from it . carlos and i will be holding our own viewing party here at the station , and it ' s open to the public . please bring one pluck item , one bundle of dried hers to mollify station management , and of course , galoshes . you ' re going to need galoshes . ca not wait ! and now a segment i like to call cecil gershwin palmer ' s theater of the mind . please , with your mind ' s eye , travel into a theater . you are in a theater . you print your tickets at home , annoyed that for unfathomable reasons , this theater does not do will call . then you forget the tickets you printed out , so you have to argue with the guy in the box office for a bit before it turns out , they can in fact print your tickets there , they just do not want to . that sorted , you enter the lobby . it smells like wet velvet . the paint is peeling a bit , but you can see that once this theater was really something . it ' s still something , you suppose , just a very different kind of something . you do not have to pe e , but you think you probably should just in case . the bathroom is tiny and it has a long line , so you decide not to pe e . except of course now that you thought about it , you do have to pe e . you sit in your seat and hope the first act is not too long , and mentally trace out the route you ' ll speed-walk the moment the lights come up for intermission , so you ' ll be one of the first at the bathroom . finally , some ten minutes after the show was supposed to start , the curtain opens . that ' s it for this installment of cecil gershwin palmer ' s theater of the mind . next time , we ' ll get into the actual show , so look forward to that . controversy has arisen about dana ' s plans to radically expand her mayor al power , which were leak ed to the public through – some unknown channel . no really , it could have been anyone who told . the city council was the loudest voice of protest . their lungs are huge , and they can make their voice deafening . ` ` the machinery of night vale government is delicate , '' the city council screamed loud enough that it woke even larry le roy out on the edge of town , who was asleep because it was 4 am . ` ` this policy shift can only upset the checks and balances inherent in our system . for instance , we the city council check and balance everything and ultimately make all the decisions . that ' s how civic government is supposed to work . '' and then they keener for several hours and we all gave up and got out of bed , because none of us were getting any more sleep that night . joining the dissent , tamika lynn - local armed te en militia leader and the sole member of the city council who is not a single-bodied , multi-voiced , inhuman entity - expressed concern about government over reach . she said : ` ` if the government ever tries to over reach me , i ' ll grab that arm they ' re reaching with and do a series of self defense maneuvers to di sable the over reaching government . sorry , '' she continued , ` ` that metaphor kind of got away from me . what i ' m saying is , while dana is a good person and a friend of mine , expanding government power on the assumption that the government will always be run by well meaning people is a dangerous gamble . '' dana herself did not alleviate these concerns , as many people reported her acting strangely in public throughout town . she burst into many local business es , demanding to know if they knew where she was . they would tell her she was in their store and she would get angry and storm out . she was also spotted standing across from city hall , monitoring the front doors with binoculars . perhaps this is part of a social program we just do not understand yet . or perhaps she is annoyed at a big-mouthed friend of hers who is very , very sorry . more on this story as i ' m it ' s going to develop . and now , traffic . a businessman sits in an airplane , mid-flight , staring out the window . she pretends she is doing this because she is bored . she is actually doing this because she is nervous . the plane is shaking and she is looking out the window to see what is causing this , but of course she can not see what is causing this . instead , what she sees is a miracle , imagined in thousands of years in human science and theology . what she sees is the top side of the clouds . here is the place that her species , since the start of it , have projected worlds onto . have looked up at and told stories , some based on what was observed , some based on what was felt , but all based on never being able to see the top side of the clouds . and oh , there were those in the mountains who could see the top side of low-lying clouds , but that ' s not the same at all , is it ? nothing like going to the top layer of clouds and breaking through until there is only space above and clouds below . and here she is , nervously sipping a spite and looking out the window and worrying about what will happen when she lands . which is that she ' ll lose her job . although she does not know that yet , because she ' s still in the air , looking down at the top side of the clouds . this has been traffic . and now a word from our sponsors . pay no attention to the vase in your backward . all human beings die . this is unrelated to the vase in your backward . you do not remember purchasing that vase . certainly it does not seem like your style . it would not go with any of your things , and that is not a color you buy glass work in . you are , just in this moment , realizing you have opinions about the color of glass work , and this is causing you to assess in some small way your sense of self . but pay no attention to that vase in your backward . we all get slower , get sick , and then we pass on . this is unrelated to the vase in your backward . the vase in your backward did not cause this . it is an inornate vase , not of any recognizable era or culture . perhaps you should plant climbing vines or thick shrub around the vase , so that eventually , you wo not have to see it anymore . it will be covered over with greenery , as you will some day be covered over with greenery . everything will eventually be covered over with greenery , until the greenery goes too . but pay no attention to the vase in your backward . all human beings die . this is unrelated to the vase . this message was brought to you . worries continue to rise about the mayor ' s controversial initiatives . the sheriff was especially put out by the planned shifting of the secret police to the per view of the mayor ' s office . ` ` over my dead body , '' said the sheriff . ` ` and i was told by a psychic once that i would never die , and we all know that lying is illegal , and so my dead body will never exist for anything to be over . the point is it ' s not happening . '' there are , however , those who are in favor of the plan . like green market owner tristan cortez who said , ` ` we all know , as citizens of night vale , that our government is a difficult beast . doing just about any activity requires tons of forms and waiting in lines and puts us at risk of being devoured by the beings that run city hall . as a tax pa yer , i welcome a shake up in our government . plus , i ' ve been in the sheriff ' s secret prison since my daughter and i got caught committing robbery and fraud this fall , so really any change seems good to me . '' well , this is a complex issue and – oh my god . oh no . what is , what ... ? u m , listeners , i ' ve just been handed a report . tit seems that a secret parking enforcement officer struck up a conversation with dana , as she sat across from city hall , watching it through binoculars . dana had stared at the officer without replying , and when the officer took a step towards her in order to give her a friendly pat on the arm , she – she , she killed him . i do not understand , but i am being asked to tell you that our mayor and my friend , dana cardinal , is wanted for murder . let me ... let ' s just go to the weather . this story , already concerning , has gotten both more confusing and more frightening . i ' ve received a recorded statement from our mayor , dana cardinal , and it ' s ... well , you should listen for yourself . dana : once there came a sandstone . this was years ago . so much of what we ' ve lived through now was put into motion for us long before . but by the time the consequences come , we ' ve set aside the inciting incident as agent history . once there came a sandstone , and with it came our doubles . when my double came , she attacked me . or i attacked her . i do not remember who acted first . we struggled . it was a brutal fight that could have ended badly for either of us . but the result was that i murdered my double with a staple r . it was as slow and gruesome as you imagine . or i think i murdered my double . it ' s possible i am my double , and i murdered my original self . if we both had the same memories leading up to that moment , how would i know which of us i was ? i am dana , or i am her double . i will live forever with that doubt . i believe in what i am trying to do with my position as mayor . why else would i have been given a job so onerous in its responsibility , if i was not meant to use that responsibility for the greater good ? so that is what i am trying to do , night vale . i am trying to work for the greater good . but i know not everyone is with me . i have felt followed for the last few days . threatened . i thought the groups who are opposed to my vision for night vale were trying to physically stop me . this has , as you know , happened before . and now these false murder charges . i have been framed , obviously . i mean , i know that i just admitted to killing someone years ago , but trust me that i did not do this one . it ' s a set up to throw even more obstacles in the way of making the role of mayor one which actually does good for this town . or that is what i thought . i no longer know what to think . because right now , i am staring at myself . there is another me . she is in my living room . her hair is shorter than mine . her face is hard and furious . and her hands – they are covered in blood . but she is me . i have come for myself . i ' m going to run now . i ' m going to hide . but this is not over . i will make night vale a better place , if it kills me . or if i kill me . i will keep in touch . if you see me , do not approach . it is me but not me , and i do not know what i am capable of . stay safe . cecil : well . i certainly do remember the day of the sandstone , and the day of the doubles . it was actually a pretty traumatic time , if i ' m honest . so i appreciate what dana is going through , but – murder is a serious charge . especially at a time when such controversial changes are going on over at the mayor ' s office . for their part , the sheriff has said that dana cardinal is wanted for murder , and they do not care which dana they get . ` ` any dana , '' the sheriff said waving their hand greedily . ` ` if we see a dana , we will arrest her , and bob ' s your uncle , into jail she goes . '' when questioned whether this had anything to do with mayor cardinal ' s current effort to take over the sheriff ' s secret police , the sheriff huffed a bit and said things like , ` ` well i never , '' and then hung up without answering the question . what does it mean if the doubles are back ? and what is going on with dana cardinal ? none of those questions answered now , because stay tuned next for bubble gum hour , the hour devoted for reviewing the chewing sounds of popular varieties of bubble gum , host ed by today ' s celebrity chew er , mr . tom hanks . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : hey , what ' s your sign ? mine ' s a stop sign . i stole it from an intersect ion , and i hold it up every time someone tries to talk to me .
WTNV|A Matter of Blood Part 2|15 May 2018|as a matter of fact , the facts do not matter . welcome to night vale . listeners , it is upon us . yes , today is the day of the blood matter from space . that extremely rare cosmological event we are all so lucky to witness . and the astronomers tell us that this is going to be a big one . ` ` aaaaaaaaaaa ! '' the astronomers screamed from the conservatory up on cactus hill . the astronomers gesture up at the sky with gaping eyes and lolling mouths . ` ` oh god , oh god , oh god ! '' they added . here at the station , carlos and i are throwing a little viewing party . lots of folks from town are in attendance , and if you ' re listening , consider yourself invited . just bring a pluck item and a friendly face , and we ' ll do the rest . i would head over soon though , because of course you do not wan na be caught outside during the blood matter from space . pamela mitchell is here , lugging around her emergency press conference kit . she ' s very excited and she anticipates a need for a number of emergency press conferences today . she also brought vegetarian such , and i ' ve scarf ed down like six of those suckers . susan tillman only brought a plastic box of store-brand chocolate chip colonies with the price tag still attached . ok , susan . i do not wan na be down on anybody , but ... she then decided to be rude about the scones that steve carlsberg brought , and sure my brother steve ' s scones might be a little drier than some prefer , and maybe could use a tablespoon or three less salt . but it ' s the love that is put into a food delicious , and no one holds more love in his heart than steve . so quit ragging on him , susan ! one conspicuous absence from our party today is our mayor , dana cardinal . she is still wanted for murder . both of her . there now appears to be two dans . one version of herself , the one that i have known for years , is hiding and no one has any idea at all of her location . she could be anywhere , and she is probably impossible to find . the other dana , the one who is a stranger to us , is out in the open . she is highly dangerous . all who have approached her to attempt an apprehension have run away injured or dead . do you have any idea how painful it is to run while dead ? stay clear of her ! more on this situation , and on the great party we have going on here , soon . dana : i still believe in this town and in its people . there is good here . so much good , and i mean to expand on that good and fight like hell against anyone endangering it . but for now , i must do that from an disclosed location . my hosts at this secure and secret spot have been very sweet about the situation , even though their house only has one bathroom . fortunately , my arrival did help settle a long-standing argument as one of my hosts had wanted to turn the guestroom into a home lab , and the other wanted to turn it into a home broadcast studio , but since i needed a place to sleep , for now the guestroom will remain a guestroom . do not come looking for me . i could be anywhere and you would never find me . this situation , in which there is another version of me , hunting me , apparently looking to kill me – this is a distraction . what i did the last time i met my double , that is also a distraction . i can only look to the future , move to the future , and leave behind any choice i made in the past . today my new mayor al powers will become active . i understand concerns about the vast amount of personal information and power that will pass through my office , but i can only tell you that i mean the absolute best for this town . i love this place ! and i would never abuse the power i have seized . other dana : what a pitiful town . what a pitiful world . i ache for home . here they mule and they scramble . they die so easily . i wish anyone would put up the fight that i deserve . i would still tear them asunder , but oh to feel some fear before i kill ! just once . but i am not here for that kind of satisfaction . i seek a deeper justice . a man in an official uniform steps up to me . he ' s sweating and pale and glancing back at a line of men in suits watching with crossed arms . one of the men in suits nods at the man in front of me and gestures forward . ` ` uuhhhh , '' this sweating man says . i say nothing , i do not even look at him . ` ` uhhhh , '' he says again . ` ` e-e-excuse me but uhhh , e-eh but it seems you ' re under arrest so ... '' finally , i turn . he branches . ` ` i have a message for your superiors , '' i tell him . ` ` uhhh , ooh , '' he says . ` ` what is it , i can tell them for you ? '' ` ` do not worry , '' i say gently . ` ` i ' ll tell them myself right now . '' then i cut his throat . he looks so surprised . he was afraid but never expected his fears to be fulfilled . weakness ! ugh , pathetic . i maintain eye contact with the men in suits while the man before he whispers away into the dirt . once he is finally quiet , i turn and leave . what a pitiful town ! what a pitiful world ! i ache for home . cecil : the viewing party for the blood matter from space is in full swing , and we ' re all having a blast here . pamela mitchell has had a good deal of spiked eggnog , and is now having people shout out topics for emergency press conferences , and then improving the press conference based on that . it ' s a lot of fun and also very loud and monopolizing the party a little , but that ' s ok . carlos is explaining some of the science behind the blood matter from space but the truth is , we just do not know that much about what it is or why it happens , and so his presentation contains more question marks and ` ` facts to be filled in later '' labels than usual . but it is ok sometimes to find something beautiful without fully understanding it . and it is undeniable that under certain aesthetic values and with a strong ability to stomach go re , the blood matter from space could be considered beautiful . i ' ve just checked in u h , the guest carlos and i have at the house and she ' s doing fine . no one any of you would know , u h u h a cousin of carlos ' from canada . she ' s doing great and feels secure that no one will find her in our guestroom . meanwhile , station management has emerged , terrifying , from its office . and has gone outside , where it is standing in the street with its many mouths aimed at the sky , presumably waiting for the blood matter to ascend . to be honest , i did not even know station management ate . dana : others are being hurt on my behalf , and here i hide . what a terrible feeling ! i do not want anyone hurt , and certainly not because of me . and certainly not because of my cowardice . but this is not about me or my pride . this new regime of centralized mayor al power is about the greater good , and so i must keep the greater good in mind . even if it disgraces me as a person , i must stay in hiding and work . already i have received much useful information due to my authorized access to the vague yet menacing government agency ' s database . and i am using that information to better coordinate city services . and also to stop 8 entirely separate doomsday cuts who were independently planning on attacking the city . u m , we have a lot of cuts here . who knew ? so i will have to see the greater good and continue staying in this disclosed , secure location . because it ' s not about me . it ' s no - u h , hold on . hello ? yeah . what ? what ? ! no , no please . i ' ll be right there . i ' m leaving now . i ' ll be right there ! other dana : if i can not find my weakling other , then i will make her come crawling to me . so that is why i am in this house . the older woman and the young man , they stare at me with wide eyes . the older woman says : ` ` why ? why ? '' and i tell her , i explain to her why , and she is silent and horrified , because she can not deny the righteousness of my cause . and then i cut her left pinkie off , and she starts going into that whole ` ` why ? '' thing again , and i tell her that i just explained to her why , and if she ' s asking why specifically i needed to remove her pinkie , it ' s because i needed to make clear the seriousness of my purpose . that i neither wish to cause harm or wish to avoid harm . i will cause harm as needed , to the degree it is needed . i tell her that next i will kill the young man , because it is my judgment that this order of operations would cause the most impact , and lead to the fulfillment of my mission here . but she is not listening . she is ( - ) at her hand . ` ` you hardly would have used that finger anyway , '' i tell her , and i got to the window to wait for my double . if the possible murder of her mother and brother in her own childhood home does not make her come to me , then i have severely misjudged myself . cecil : listeners , i ' m getting reports that the situation with dana has taken an alarming and imminent ly tragic turn . but before we get into more of this , let ' s do a quick check on the weather . other dana : you may judge me evil . you may judge me heartless . you may judge me however you like . that is your burden . here is my burden . i am dana , as much so as that other woman . we are both ourselves completely . we simply lived in different versions of our world , and so grew to become different people . this is as natural as water freezing to ice , as seeds growing to trees . it ' s just less noticeable to us , since it takes place on an axis of space and time not visible to the average human . but i did not have the luxury of disregarding it , because once upon a time , in this world , some people met themselves as a result of a certain interdimensional confusion inherent to this location . this was neither a mistake nor a disaster , nor a blessing . it was just a random act of nature , no different from the sandstone that accompanied it . but dana . this dana you cherish as your mayor . she met herself and she committed murder . she killed one of us . one of the dans . and we all felt it . to murder your own blood , to kill a you from another timeline , that is an unthinkable crime . so other dans , we got together and we discussed what had happened , and it was clear to us that our sister who was also us , she must stand accountable for her crime . i was the most able and warlike of all of us , having been raised in a universe in which those skill were necessary . so i was chosen to come and to make our sister responsible for her actions all those years ago . i have been searching for her a long time . you think i wanted this ? you think i do not envy this dana , with her friends , with her town , with her goodwill toward others ? i did not seek vengeance . she brought this vengeance to me , and so it is my sad lot to carry it out until the end . until i can force me to face myself . dana : i killed my double . or i am the double who killed the original . i have no way of knowing which , and that guilt has stuck with me ever since . it seemed to me that if i were the one who survived , then i must make that survival worthwhile by doing good to our town . but i can not ignore my family . and so i go . i am on my way to my family ' s house . before i go , i am penalizing the transfer of power to the mayor al office . it is done . the changes to the mayor ' s power are fully in effect . of course , i do not know how much longer i will be in effect . so let these changes stand as my legacy . no more running . it ' s time for me to face myself . cecil : listeners . u h from the viewing party at the community radio station , u h i have some serious news to tell you . which is why i ' ve locked myself in this supply closet where i can get , you know , a little quiet to record with . come on , pamela , please ! please keep it down , pamela ! ok , i must report that the mayor al program has gone into effect . as of now , all surveillance and enforcement power in this town is run directly through the mayor ' s office . may the distant lights that guide us from the upper stratosphere be with our mayor and with our citizens . and , oh my god , oh my god listeners , theatre blood matter from space , it ' s here ! it has arrived ! oh god , it ' s here ! today ' s proverb : our money back guarantee : when you die , the world gets your money back .
WTNV|A Matter of Blood Part 3|1 June 2018|we make our own luck . which is to say , things random happen and we apply our personal ideas about luck to that random ness . welcome to night vale . everything has changed . there was a before the blood matter from space and an after . our town is still our town but it is altered and can never be the same . it is difficult to interpret what has happened as a matter of history . we are not enough removed to be able to understand every facet . it is better , instead , that we listen through the event as it happened in the moment . on that day , the day of the blood matter from space . so , i take you back two weeks . mayor cardinal had just activate a new program rout ing most power and surveillance through the mayor ' s office . at the same time , she was wanted for murder . because her double had come to town and killed many people . her double went to her family ' s house in order to draw dana cardinal out , and it worked . as dana approached her family ' s house in order to face this other version of herself , the blood matter from space descended upon us . here ' s what happened next . other dana : this is not a story about a good dana and a bad dana . i how satisfying such a story might have been for you , but i am not a bad dana . just a dana who was willing . a dana who does what is needed . because the dana that you are tempted to call good , just because you have spent more time with her than you have with me ? she killed her own double years ago . she killed her , our , blood . and so i have come to call her to account in the name of all dans in all universe . mine is a righteous cause . this dana ' s mother , who looks exactly like my mother , sobs in the corner , clutching her hand from which i have now removed three fingers . a count down of sorts for my other dana . next , i will murder her – my – brother . i will show her that i can not be dissuade from my mission . and apparently , i have shown her , because as the blood starts to pour down outside , streaming the windows in vivid red , i see myself standing outside and calling our name . dana : dana ! i shout . dana ! leave our family alone ! come out and face yourself . i ' m waiting . i brought no weapon . i am not there to fight and kill yet another version of myself . the first struggle has left me with such shame that i have sought great good for my town in order to atone . but apparently that has not been enough . my fallen double will haunt me forever . the blood gains quickly on the streets , and by the time that other me comes smirking out of the door , we are knee-deep . the sky is a heaving mass of strange clouds . everything smells like blood . i can smell nothing else . other dana : we face ourselves in that lake of red , our faces streaked , our eyes steady on each other . cecil : while this was going on , the blood space matter viewing party here at the station was going swimming , in that we all had to start swimming . none of us , not even carlos , had been aware of just how deep the blood matter was going to get . apparently the station is a bit of a low point in the local geography , and so we flooded significantly more than the rest of town . still , we all made the best of it , having ourselves something of a macabre pool party . unfortunately my life in the desert had not prepared me for swimming much , or at all , but fortunately my broadcast equipment float . so i sat astride my radio desk , sobbing about in the blood . oh night vale , what are we going to do ? the mayor ' s new plan of centralized power is still in effect . the mayor is in charge of everything , and not much can be done without her say . which is a huge problem now for obvious reasons . other dana : i eye myself over . this other me , she is weak . i see no strength in her . she thinks she has seen hardship . she thinks she has experienced responsibility . but now i am her reckoning . i am the proof that she is unworthy of the name dana cardinal . you are guilty , i proclaim . this is a sentencing , not a conversation . i continue : you have murdered one of us , and you have been found guilty by your other serves . you must pay for your crime . she bites her lip . the blood we both standing in is soaking into her jeans . she shakes her head , she draws herself up . a fight , then . very well . i had hoped for some back bone . there are worse places to find it than in myself . dana : this dana from some other world ? she is not wrong . i killed my double . or , i am the double who killed the original . that is true . and i have felt , every day , sorrow and guilt and confusion over that . i have punished myself in my thoughts and in my nightmare . but now there is this external avenge r , come to see to it that i suffer even more . i had no choice that day of the sandstone . it was me or that other me , and i chose me . that is what happened . it was survival , plain and simple . with a slight pre-shuffle of luck , there could have been that other dana standing here , knee-deep in the blood , under clouds that looked like angry boils . or , i think i had no choice ? i think it was a matter of survival . maybe things could have been resolved peacefully if i had made different decisions . or if i was a different person . but i am only me . of course , now i know there is not ` ` only me '' . and seeing my resolve , the dana from another world fellows like a predator animal . it is shilling to know that somewhere in me , that bellow lives , even though i ' ve never brought it out . and the other dana comes for me , abrupt and violent . cecil : cecil again , again from the present . and what a chaos this present is ! because even though the town ' s power and decision making runs entirely through the mayor ' s office , there is no mayor now to make those decisions . the mayor ' s chair has sat empty for two weeks , and it may well be that no one will ever sit in that chair again . this is metaphorical . the chair itself will be collected by janitorial services and assigned to a new location on municipal property , in which an impressive chair is needed . but we still will be a town with no leader . oh , mayor cardinal . oh , dana . other dana : i stride forward to kill her . it is a simple operation , like turning on a car . there are a few easy movements and then it is done . so it has been with everyone in this soft universe . but the dana of this world ? she is not soft . she meets my lazy killing blow with a turned shoulder and is already punch ing me in the gut . i ' m not prepared to this , so i fall backwards into the blood , sinking below it for a moment before rising out , a scarlet creature . so this is how she was able to murder one of us . this is how she was able to survive multiple attempts upon her life , from that erstwhile dragon hiram . she has a deep well of strength and an absolute instinct for continuing to breathe . i had wanted a fight that would make me struggle , and it seems i have found it . we are now waist-deep in the blood . i shout and rush forward and we clash once again . dana : i am prepared to fight for my belief that there is good in this town . that this town deserves to exist , and by extension , the people who live in this town deserve to exist . and by extension , i deserve to exist . she strikes at me , now with a knife . i grab her arm , re direct her momentum away from my tarso , but i feel the blade slip through the side of my hand , as easily as a thought slips through a mind . i know i am bleeding , but i have no way of gauging how bad the wound is when i am already covered in blood . meanwhile , this other dana is already swinging again , this time for my throat , or my face , i ca not tell . but the outcome would be equally catastrophe . i reach inside , looking for a response , some instinct . and i find that bellow . the same one that had come from her . it was waiting for me my whole life , and i bring it out now . i bellow , guttural and deep and cutting through the sound of falling blood . as she s wings the knife , i french her arm back toward herself , stabbing the blade into her shoulder and then heaving forward with a wild kick , sending her sprawling back under the blood . other dana : a circumstance i could never have imagined . i have failed . i have never failed before , and so i saw no warning signs . i would not have been able to imagine what those warning signs would have looked like . the blood sting s my eyes and worms its way down my throat . i came up coughing and gasping . the knife is in my shoulder . the dana of this world ? she yanks the knife out , and i gasp with a horrible sea ring pain . she wields the knife before her , and i hold up my hands to acknowledge my defeat . i wait for death . after all , it has been waiting for me my whole life . but dana . she does not kill me . she cries and the tears make clean tracks across her bloody face . she toss es the knife away and it is lost into the blood . she lowers herself to her knees before me . in doing so , she goes neck-deep , just her face peering at me from the surface . we are both at the same level now . both almost submerged . cecil : the conclusion of what concluded two weeks ago in just a moment . but i really do need to check in on the weather . dana : i am guilty , i say . everything you say about me is true . i killed my double . or i am the double and i killed the original . either is a grievous crime against a person who was and was not me . and i should stand accountable for that . that crime has haunted me ever since . i present myself to you , who is also me , for judgment . i am ready for me to judge myself . other dana : i look at this woman . the blood lapping at her ears , soaking into her hair . i clinch toward her and she makes no move to defend herself . in her eyes , i see anguish , i see guilt . it would be an easy set of three movements from this moment to her death . but i do not take any of them . she does not need to stand any more accountable than she has already made herself . she does not need any more punishment than that which she has already given to herself , every hour of every day . she has not forgiven her crime any more than any other version of her has . i rise and stride away into that down pour of blood and return to my brutal , familiar world . dana : i watch her leave , and i am not surprised . how could i be ? she is me . i am her . i stand , and make my way slowly , sometimes swimming , sometimes wading , to ra don canyon . the blood rushes over the sides , a torrent . the voices from ra don canyon chose me as mayor four years ago , and i accepted their choice . but now i see . the power i have endowed to the mayor ' s office should not be given to someone like me . someone whose judgment is so flaw ed , who has made mistakes so human . ` ` i give up my position , '' i shout at the voices . ` ` choose another ! '' ` ` no , the voices echo back , ` ` you are the mayor . '' ` ` i refuse ! '' i say . ` ` i-i wo not do it ! '' ` ` we will not choose another , '' the voices say . ` ` until you complete your service as mayor . ` ` then you will never choose another , '' i say and return to my mother ' s house . i embrace her and i embrace my mother . i will live a life that is not perfect , but also not perfectly unhappy . i ' m not a bad person . i just am not a good enough person to wield that power . and i think perhaps no one is . night vale does not have a mayor , and it never will again . i am dana cardinal . i am the double , or i am the original , but i am dana either way . i have stood accountable for my crimes , and now i come out the other side , ready to live my life as a fellow citizen . as a fellow human being . cecil : so ended the day of the blood matter from space . clean up has been under way and will go on for several weeks more . it seems that everything in town will be tinged just slightly red for the foresee able future . as there really is no way to get that much blood matter off of a town . we have no mayor , and it seems we never will again . all of the authority in night vale , thanks to dana cardinal ' s new system , runs through the mayor ' s office . an office that will forever remain empty . already there is chaos , as agents of the vague yet menacing government agency and the sheriff ' s secret police both wander about town , seeking orders , but finding no one with the authority to give them . the city council howl s and whine s , but we do not know if they have any power anymore . the falcon can not hear the falcon . everything is uncertain . except that dana , my friend and a friend of many of yours , is healthy . and perhaps for the first time in years , truly at peace . and maybe for now that is enough . soon though , we ' re go n na have to figure out this whole government thing , because it is a mess out there . literally . lot of blood matter still . from a town turning and turning in the widening ( dire ) , i say to you : good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : my name for the pony i have been planning to get one day has been pony west , for years . but for obvious reasons , i have recently changed it to panelled poneigh . this was not written for me by joseph , these are the actual names i ' ve made up for my dream pony . thank you .
WTNV|A Story About Us|15 June 2018|this is a story about us , said the man in the radio . and we were pleased , because we always wanted to hear about ourselves on the radio . welcome to night vale . this is a story about us . we live in trailer out near the car lot , next to the house where the angels reside . we live in homes near a poorly secured library , hiding and shivering , fearing an escape . we live in apartments below heavy-footed neighbors . we live on streets , removing ourselves from a world that refuses to learn how to love us . at night , we can see the red light blinking on and off on top of the radio tower . a tiny flurry of human activity against the implacable back drop of stars and void . we sit out on the steps of our trailer , on the balcony of our apartment , on a bench in mission grove park , on a tree swing in our yard . with our backs to the brightness of the moon , watching the radio tower for hours . but only sometimes . mostly we do other things . this is a story about us . we eat together in the moonlite all-nite din er . one of us is philanthropist thomas charles fleming , who once caught a ho g and showed it to a local radio host , who happened to find hogs adorable , and just wanted to pet one and speak in high-pitched voices to it , and name it mary or dolores , and listen to its snorting breaths i order to feel alive . especially on that particular day , where that radio host ' s inter forgot to buy coffee . anything to start the day with a charge . thomas charles sits in the moonlite all-nite eating his skirt speak , and he begins to choke . we are alarmed , because we feel empathy . selfish , selfish empathy . we feel our own necks ( cease ) up . we hold our hands to our own throats gently , choreographed mimicked , a mo der dance around the themes of mortality , as thomas charles heaves forward gasping , his eyes bulging . we look to the osha-mandated choking assistance poster near the cash register . we begin to recite the instructions to each other and demonstrate the moves required to complete this life-saving ( – ) . one of us , dinosaur expert joel eisenberg , stands and wraps his thin arms around thomas charles . joel pulls his hands into a central fist under the victim ' s sternum . joel yanks his hand back and up , and we shout , ` ` harder ! '' and some of us shout , ` ` softer ! '' thomas charles thinks of the new night vale botanic gardens he created . his mind wanders to the pride he felt opening this cultural institution , and secretly , the guilt he feels about the frightening people he partner ed with to fund it . he knows he must warn us , but does not know about what , exactly . in dying , we often find that the lists of what must be done elaborate , and there is nothing left to be done , and there never was . needing to do this was an illusion we built to keep ourselves busy . we panic in our efforts to free thomas charles ' oesophagus . one of us , laura , a witness in the din er , breaks off a heavy branch that is growing out of her hip , and begins poking thomas charles in the chest . we frantically fumble for our phone tying in ` ` heimlich maneuver '' , all un sure how to spell it . some of us saying , ` ` it ' s h-i-e '' , others saying , ` ` h-e-i '' , one of us even saying , ` ` maneuver has an o in it somewhere , i ' m sure of it '' . we find an article headline ` ` save a choking victim with one surprising move '' , but become frustrated by the amount of pop-up windows . thomas charles grabs a pen and a napkin and scrawled a single word . we argue about what exactly it says . ` ` maybe he wrote ‘ swan pus ' '' , we say . ` ` that ' s not a word , '' we reply . ` ` what about ‘ sound-roos ' ? '' we intersect as we stare at ourselves wondering who would think that made any sense . ` ` you know , like children ' s pyjamas made from audit frequencies , '' one of us says . ` ` it could work , '' that same one says to the quiet room , then continuing : ` ` as a technology start up , like an a pp on your phone that makes ... '' before trailing off , running out of words to protect the judgment al silence . ` ` oh it ' s a great idea , '' we all agree in order to ameliorate the situation . and we pat thomas george on the back to congratulate him on his multimillion dollar idea of audio-only children ' s sleepware . we think for a moment that it is this companionable s wat of the choking man ' s ribs that will finally free the speak from his throat . we have read enough short stories to know that this is a sensible narrative resolution , requiring an unforeseen solution to an impossible problem . and given that we are hearing our story on the radio , we know that this is the perfect culmination of a tale about a collective we , a coming together , a climactic comradery . but it does not work . thomas charles sinks to his knees , eyes wet and resolved . in the commotion of choking hazards , clickbait , and start up dreams , we fail to notice two men who have entered the din er . one is not tall . one is not short . they are not part of us , so we know that this story is not about them . the one who is not short moves joel eisenberg aside and then grabs thomas charles ' shoulders . the one who is not tall punch es thomas charles in the stomach , as a piece of beef shoomps out of his mouth , a rope of spit and a soft wee ze tailing it . the piece of chewed meat arc s perfectly into a waste basket , and we cheer . these strangers saved a man we barely knew . thomas charles inhaled loudly and finally shouts , ` ` it says ‘ stone crops ' . stone crops ! '' ` ` shut up , '' says the man who is not tall . ` ` come outside , '' says the man who is not short . ` ` please , '' thomas charles pleads . ` ` i ' m sorry i told them about stone crops . '' ` ` everyone is sorry you did that , '' says the not-short man . ` ` this is not how i wanted to spend my day , '' says the not-tall man . we hear the radio describe two men of indistinct heights , walking another man out of the moonlite all-nite . we hear the man on the radio describe a muffled pop of a handful from the parking lot , the slamming of a trunk , and the fading copper effect of a vehicle speeding away . we sit in our booths , poking hashbrowns with spoons , imagining we heard a car backfiring instead . we leave the din er and find a blood stain on the shalt by our truck , or our sedan , or our motorcycle , and we pretend it is a spilled drink . let ' s have a look at the community calendar . last saturday at noon , we all went to the botanic gardens , for the opening of the new exhibit called ( serum fields ) . one of us who is a do sent at the gardens named hall darwish , explained to us that these succulent plants are excellent for private gardens , as they are unfordable , easy to maintain , beautiful , and require little water . serum are often referred to as ` ` stone crops '' , hall tells us before it means anything . she then thanked thomas george fleming and an anonymous benefactor for funding the botanic gardens . on monday , we attended an emergency press conference at the site of city hall , where no mayor currently pre sides . before an empty mi c , reporter asked questions and then tried to transcribe the occasional sounds of wind and crickets onto their notepads . one of us , pamela mitchell , characteristically tamped down her usual bluster and allowed someone else to speak for her , in this case the incidental sounds of nature . on tuesday , we took a longer than usual lunch break to go look again at the serum fields exhibit at the botanic gardens , and we saw the sunny summer bloom , which are elongated pink tubes following at the top , looking ready to burst . but in the middle , there are symmetrical bulges , like small crouching humans inside . a do sent who was not hall darwish , and who was not any of us , and who was neither tall nor short , told us to look at another plant . these were not for us . as we got back into our vehicles , cranberry spina ch salad with sesame vinaigrette only half eaten , we caught a glimpse of this new do sent plucking the unopened bloom and placing them gently into crates . we heard one of us on the radio say this aloud , as we scattered back to our desk and counters and warehouses and truck s and kitchen . this has been ... a ... loops . that was last week ' s community calendar . well , this has been community history . disturbed by the presence of the men who carry crates , who possibly kill philanthropist ho g catches , and who hurry us through our garden visits , we anxiously eat our daily meals . absentmindedly do our jobs and mutter angrily during shower about our own inaction in the face of brutally by those who are not us . ` ` we are people of action . this is a story about us , '' we say aloud in unison from our couches . we stand and walk and look at each other in the streets and join hands . we join hands and sing . we sing ` ` angel is a centerfold '' , because some of us had just attended a minor league baseball game and could not rid themselves of the exist tearworn . we walk past the scrublands and the sand wastes to the edge of the desert , and we surround a cargo truck filled with crates . there are two men , neither tall nor short . they do not move . one of us , who is a sheriff named sam , places the men under arrest for the murder of thomas charles fleming . the man who is not tall says , ` ` he was not the man you thought he was . '' the man who is not short says , ` ` do they still have ho in the abandoned mine shaft out of town ? '' ` ` this is not a story about you , '' we shout . ` ` this is a story about us . '' sam places the two handcuffed men into a white police car with ` ` undercover police '' with bold letter ing across the sides , and a stylized rhinoceros holding a night stick painted on the hood . we turn to each other and celebrate with smiles and eye contact . diane clayton tells nazr al-mujaheed : ` ` we saved our town . '' nazr groans and does not respond . he has talked little in recent months . susan tillman tells simone rigideaux : ` ` what a happy ending . '' amber akin tells wilson levy : ` ` this is a better world now , wilson . for our son . '' she pat s her belly , and wilson begins to cry . steve carlsberg , who can sometimes be a kill joy , but whose intuition is not often wrong , says : ` ` look ! the truck ! '' we look at the truck . ` ` this is not a story about a truck , '' we say , as six-foot-long pink bloom burst from tiny crates . they stumble and squire , like humans saddled in plastic wrap , toward us , under a clear predictable afternoon sky and in the face of terror . the last thing on our minds is the weather . the protagonist of a story must have agency , must use their skill against their antagonist . this is a story about us , and so we actively confront our predicament . nilanjana sikdar attempts to communicate with the beings . they make no noise . pamela winchells shouts at them through a bullion , but they do not react . josh clayton changes his physical form into a great white shark , but they show no fear . and he finds it hard to breathe on land , so changes back into a hummingbird . henrietta bell throws her co-worker , sarah sultan , who is a fist-sized river rock , at the creatures but they do not clinch . 16-year-old tamika lynn loads a cross bow with an explosive-tipped arrow , and we question our lackadaisical weapons laws in this state . overwhelmed , we back against each other , surrounded by the writhing featureless beasts . a flower monster reaches out , its arms stretching , elastic under the petals and touches former mayor dana cardinal . another touches harrison kip , and another touches leann hart , just as she reaches for the hatchet she keeps in a waste bolster . the top of the flower opens up , and inside it is you . yes , specifically you . we all recall many years ago , there once was a story about you , right here on this radio station . now your eyes are open , but empty . your face swollen and teeth shattered in places . part of your right ear is gone . and we remember you died in that story . we all felt bad . but here you are , again , inside a flower , staring crooked and blank at our screaming faces . another flower opens , and another broken face of someone who once lived in night vale . and another , and another . and as the last flower opens , the face of thomas charles fleming emerges , his head split right where his hair once parted . this lips in the final hiss of an s , like a man whose last word was ` ` stone crops '' . sheriff sam returns with the two men and re leases them from their handcuffs , ordering them to take those monstrosities away from here and then come back to be arrested . the men gently lift each writhing bloom into the back of the cargo truck . they say nothing . we ask : ` ` who are you ? '' they say nothing . ` ` what are these crates ? '' they say nothing . ` ` these are people you have killed . '' they pause briefly , but say nothing . ` ` are the crates always filled with bodies which are also flowers ? '' the men shake their heads no . the man who is not short says , ` ` we are only doing our job . '' ` ` and what is your job ? '' we ask . ` ` we handle the crates , '' says the one who is not tall . ` ` are you hiring ? '' says trish hide , who recently lost her job at city hall . ` ` the botanic gardens are closed to the public , '' the not-short man says . ` ` it is better that no one involve themselves with this , '' the not-tall man says . they climb into the truck and drive away with their broken crates and human flowers . we look at each other , relieved to know we completed another day , alive and together , but bereft of solutions or answer . ` ` we have defeated gods ! '' we say . ` ` and dragons ! '' we say . ` ` and librarian ! '' we say . ` ` and despotic corporate overlords ! '' we say and kind of high five each other about that one in particular . ` ` but these men , '' missy wilkes says . ` ` maintenance men , '' leann hart says , already writing a story in her head . ` ` mafia , '' sheriff sam suggests . ` ` they ' re kind of cut e , '' michelle nguyen says , as her girlfriend maureen nods in agreement . ` ` not everyone gets to know everything , '' we tell ourselves . ` ` we have limitations , '' we say , stumbling upon a new truth . ` ` and when we know what we can not know , we can believe whatever we want . '' ` ` flower mafia , '' sheriff sam insists . ` ` cancer is actually more inexplicable and frightening than those men , '' lorelai avare says from great and terrible experience . and we sigh and , yeah , collectively nod . culminating in a town-wide understanding that we not only touched the sky , but pushed against it . we know more about what we can not know , and we are less afraid , even if we are still quite afraid . but in a productive , positive way . like knowing not to put hornets in your mouth . we learned this , all together . tough luck about you , though . hope you ' re doing ok at the gardens , i mean it did not look like you were , but we do wish you the best . we walk to our homes , turn on our radius and hide . and we listen to a familiar voice say : ` ` this has been a story about us . '' and we are pleased , because we always wanted to hear about ourselves on the radio . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : anything is a pirate if you hit it hard enough .
WTNV|Brought to You by Kellogg’s|1 August 2018|today as all days , as every day of your life , has been brought to you by kellogg ' s . are you worthy ? welcome to night vale . hello , listeners . well , we ' ve been having some real budget troubles here at the station , so it does seem that today ' s entire broadcast will be a sponsorship message from kellogg ' s . i know that feels like a lot , but it was the only way to keep the station up and running . station management consumes three tons of soil from paris each month ! and it has been passively expensive digging it up and shipping it here . not to mention all the bribes needed for government officials . all to say that kellogg ' s has agreed to pay for u m , u h , let me check , ok . one month of soil shipments in exchange for us exclusively talking about them for the next three years . u h . ok . well that does not sound like the best bargain , but i ' ll consult the station ' s legal adviser and see if we can get out of that . oh , our legal adviser is laura , who is a server down at the moonlite all-nite din er . between shifts , she likes to read wikipedia pages about , mm , law stuff , so we often go to her for her expert opinion . in the meantime , probably best for me to just do what the contract says . this explanation brought to you , of course – by kellogg ' s . let ' s get to the news . john peters – you know , the farmer – said that some folks came to his farm . they said they were from kellogg ' s . said they heard that he grew the finest imaginary corn in the state . said they were thinking of getting into imaginary corn flakes , and that they wanted to buy up his entire crop . he told them that he already had a deal with flakey-o ' s , a good local cereal company , and that he could not go back on his word . one of the folks from kellogg ' s squinted up at the sun , then spit on the ground through tight lips . ` ` oh , '' that person said . ` ` iii would not worry about flakey-o ' s . '' to be honest , listeners , i ' m now worried about flakey-o ' s . and now the community calendar . this evening is the monthly school board meeting . topics covered will include up dating text books to contain words , rather than run es and diagram of ritual dances . hiring a new vice principal after that whole endless cave of suffering mess a few weeks ago , and replacing all food in the cafeteria with cereal . scientists from the kellogg ' s institute say that most food has no nutrition value at all . oh , wo w . i did not know that . and that only cereal contains all the protein , vitamin and corn that a body needs to live . yeah , that seems right . thursday , the boy scouts are holding their summer bake sale . they will have bowls of cereal and nothing else . the cereal is not available to you . you are available to the cereal . friday is now called kellogg ' s day . mentioning the outdated name for kellogg ' s day will result in severe fines and disappearance . ok , i ' m actually getting some sort of urgent text from carlos . hm . he says that something i ' ve said recently is not scientific ally accurate , but you know , i do not have to check what . kellogg ' s is not paying me to text . or maybe they are . you know , it ' s not clear what kellogg ' s wants from us . saturday morning is the summer football league ' s weekly game , pitting steve carlsberg ' s happy hyeenas against susan tillman ' s garage dump team . that ' s not the actual name of the team , but it should be . ugh , susan tillman ! kellogg ' s will be sponsor ing the game by replacing the softballs with fistula of apple jaws and sending employees to hur l boxes of cereal at players . sunday afternoon in grove park , sarah sultan will be offering free meditation classes . sarah is , of course , a fist-sized river rock , and so is extraordinarily good at staying still and silent . and she wants to pass these skill onto you . kellogg ' s will place a six-inch deep layer of special k over the entire park , for reasons that are their own . the night vale metereological society has issued an extreme heat watch for monday , saying , ` ` hey , it ' s a desert . in august . it ' s probably going to be hot as neck on monday , and all other days . '' kellogg ' s suggests using the sun to cook up some rice krispie treats by building a simple solar energy panel and using that to power an electric oven . and please , set aside all of tuesday , as kellogg ' s has indicated that they have use for us , all of us , on tuesday . and then kellogg ' s made this hollow dry laugh that sounded like it came from a long dormant stone well . this has been the community calendar . in other news , flakey-o ' s executive announced that they are going to stand strong against this current kellogg ' s encroachment . ` ` we are citizens of night vale , '' said flakey-o ' s chief executive , leopard tuesday . ` ` we ' ve been through a lot of terrifying stuff . it ' s a real weird town . we ' re not afraid of a competing cereal company . '' then he yelped , as the closet in his office opened and the folks from kellogg ' s came out . one of them squinted up at the sun , then spit on the office floor through lips . ` ` i would not worry about flakey-o ' s , '' the person said . and then the kellogg ' s group left the office while leopard sputtered about how they got in , and why anybody would ever spit on another person ' s floor . next up , we have traffic oh , oo p , no pe , ok . u m , i ' m being told that traffic has been replaced today by our new segment . listeners , i ' m ... pleased to bring you common kellogg ' s questions , in which you ask questions and i answer them , with off the cuff answers that are not written down for me on these carefully script ed cards . question number one : how much is too much cereal ? my offhand answer : how much is too much life ? how much is too much love ? would you deny yourself blood in your veins ? would you deny yourself dreams in your evenings ? there is not too much . there is only ever the deposit and the longing . ok , question number two : sometimes it seems my cereal boxes are watching me . i do not know how else to describe , they-they do not have eyes or anything , and they ' re just sitting there , but it feels like they ' re watching me . just improving here , but : certain measures are taken for your own good . do not worry about it . it ' s fine . and question number three : is this coupon for frosted mi ni wh eats still us able ? i ' ve had it since , like , 2007 but it does not have a date on it . is it still good ? in answer to your questions and for your extemporaneous listening pleasure : here are ten seconds of a person eating cereal , recorded really really close to their mouth . this has been common kellogg ' s questions . hey , let ' s just keep this going . health tips . did you know that corn flakes cure most cancers ? the reason you did not know that is that it is not true . but we have made a person on the radio say it to you , and now you will remember that he said it and forget that he said it was not true . because our minds are fallible and easily manipulated . o key , this is just insulting . do i really have to ... station management is not happy about my endangering their soil shipment , so let ' s just keep moving . flakey-o ' s chief executive leaped tuesday has vanished under mysterious circumstances . a white van with a kellogg ' s lo go pulled up to him as he walked to his car , and a group of people hustled him into a burlap sack and the burlap sack into the van . one of the people stopped to squint up at the sun and then spit on the ground through tight lips , before jumping in and the van roaring off . so i am being ordered by our current sponsors to report that nothing is know about leopard ' s disappearance and there are no clues indicating what happened . you know , probably he just got scared about the quality of his competitors ' products and fled . happens all the time ! all the time , kellogg ' s has asked me to repeat . now , let ' s see what kind of weather kellogg ' s has deigned to give you . in the beginning , there was nothing . there was not nonexistent or existent . there was no realm of air , no sky beyond it . what covered in and where , and what gave shelter ? was water there fathomed , depth of water ? darkness was upon the face of the deep , death was not then , nor was there ( ought ) immortal . then , there was kellogg ' s . nothing became something . kellogg ' s spread and formed . kellogg ' s became the planets and the stars . kellogg ' s gathered into long strands to become the arms of salaries , an infinity of kellogg ' s . space made tangible out of the empty . kellogg ' s became soil and water , it became trees and it became birds , and it learned to sing and it learned to speak . the first man rose and found the first woman waiting for him , and her name was kellogg ' s , and his name was kellogg ' s , and they shouted in horror at their own mortal forms . later , there were cities and before that , there were communities . and it all came from kellogg ' s and was of kellogg ' s and belonged to kellogg ' s . the people knelt and they gave a joyful thanks for their own creation , but kellogg ' s could not hear . it was a heaving dumb creature and it created out of a natural impulse , like how humans bleed , like how birds bleed , like how trees bleed . it did not create out of benevolence . kellogg ' s is not benevolent . it is not evil , either . it is a stone . it is a star . it is every empty distance between the stones ad the stars . it is not capable of morality . it . is . kellogg ' s . it is – forever . once , long ago , the first king looked out over the first kingdom . it was not a very big kingdom , but then , there were not a lot of people at that time . great empires would come later , but at that moment , the world was very small , a stretch of grassland near water . and the person who held that grass land was the king . and the grassland became a kingdom . there were titles given and borders erected . the king felt that he had created something great here , that his name would ring out forever . no one knows his name now . even 100 years after his death , it was forgotten . the only name that rings out forever – is kellogg ' s . once , there was a farmer who lived at the edge of a forest , and she worked her fields . she would look at the forest with longing , because it seemed to her that her life was built only of routine and ch ores , and that these were the walls that boxed her in . and that by monopolizing her days , these routine were killing her . they were killing her in the sense that they were taking her entire life away from her , and she felt that if she ever got the nerve , one kellogg ' s day evening , she would run into the forest . maybe it would be scar y in there , probably dangerous . she would be less comfortable than she was on the farm , but she would also be truly herself . it was all waiting for her in the forest . she never ran into it . later , she died while working one of her fields . this story does not matter . the only thing that matters – is kellogg ' s . years from now , the universe will disperse . the stars will dim , running out of the energy imbued to them when it all exploded . planets will become cold rock and molecule will stop forming , and atoms will stop vibrating and it will be still . it will be still forever . or at least until the next thing . and nothing from this thing will ever see the next thing . kellogg ' s will watch the universe ( - ) to ( fire ) and will help it lay itself to rest . and kellogg ' s will wait in the darkness . will wait as long as it needs to . forever , or what a human would perceive as forever . maybe it will wait for ten times as long as this universe ever existed , but eventually , it will stir . there will be water there , fathomed depth of water . darkness will be upon the face of the deep , and it will all start anew . there is a town , and that town is called night vale . it exists on a plane in a desert surrounded by the scrub lands and the sand wastes . above us are lights that f lit about . when they ( peer ) , we ( peer ) back , wondering . we are simple , and we love each other , and we conceal secrets and we hold multitudes , and in this way we are like anyone . we live lives that are rich with meaning and awe . or we live lives that are heavy with torment and worry , or we live lives that pass by like a wednesday afternoon and we reach the end and say , ` ` oh my god , was that it ? '' and it was . we are a community . like the king , we have made the world smaller , and in claiming this tiny corner as our entire world , we have created a kingdom . like the farmer , we eye the forest and contemplate what could be out there if we ever left , if we ever went . but few of us do . and like the universe , we are brought to us – by kellogg ' s . we belong to kellogg ' s , and we are made of kellogg ' s . we can not understand kellogg ' s , and that may be because the mystery is too complex . or , it may be because it is as simple as a monolith , and truly there is nothing to understand . flakey-o ' s is no more . the company has been bought out , with no management left to resist the hostile takeover . it is now a research wing of kellogg ' s , designed to test out a concept that kellogg ' s says they have just invented all on their own . which is a line of cereal meant for night time only . the new head of this division squinted up at the sun , then spit on their own office floor through tight lips before saying , ` ` ii would not worry about flakey-o ' s . '' that ' s it for our sponsored show . remember : today has been brought to you – by kellogg ' s . and kellogg ' s can take today away . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : keep your eye on the ball . keep your lungs on the court . leave your stomach in the lock er room .
WTNV|Bedtime Story|15 August 2018|this is a bedtime story my mother used to tell me . welcome to night vale . there once was a boy who wanted to know everything . he was smart and curious . he would draw the stars and collect insects . he would read books and write poetry . he looked at blades of grass in a magnifying glass , and he knew there was more to know . his father would tell him ` ` i love you my son , i would give my life for you . '' most days his father made him work in the pasture . the boy was not interested in operating plows or hammer or pry-bars . he was only interested in how they worked , and his curiosity would often lead him to injury . this made his father angry , but his father did not want to say an unkind word to a son . so when he was mad , he avoided the boy , not speaking to him for days , even to check to see if he was ok . his mother would tell him , ` ` i love you my son . i would give away everything i own for you . '' she sometimes baked cakes for the family . he loved cake . he loved leavening agents and the careful art of mixing flour with liquid , and the chemical reaction of eggs and fat under extreme heat . sometimes he would help , but his mother would become frustrated when he would eat a spoonfuls of raw baking soda or open the oven early and pour the unhooked batter onto the floor , to examine the consistency at different times in the baking process . his mother would cast him out and tell him no cake , no dinner even , to go to his room for the rest of the night . his sister would tell him , ` ` i hate you , brother . '' but their parents would instruct her to be nice and so she would say sarcastically , ` ` i love you , brother . i would climb the tall est mountain for you . '' but she knew she did not believe in mountains , and he would tell her that mountains were real , and she would wrestle him into the ground and pull his hair . he knew he would never need his father to give his life for him . he just wanted his father to show concern for his health . he knew he would never need his mother to give away all of her belongings for him . he just wanted his mother to show interest in his curiosity . he knew his sister really loved him . he knew he would never need his sister to climb a mountain for him . he just wanted his sister to believe him that mountains were real . one day , the boy decided he wanted to be a singer , so he could study how music makes people feel good . but his mother said , ` ` you ca not support yourself as a singer . '' another day , the boy decided he wanted to be a doctor , so he could understand how medicine works . but his father said : ` ` being a doctor means you have to perform surgery , '' and he feared for the boy ' s future patience . another day , the boy decided he wanted to be a judge , so he could make sense of the laws that govern the land . but his sister said , ` ` you get in trouble too much to be a judge . '' the boy wanted to be an chemist . later , a chef . later , an archeologist . later , a ship ' s navigators . his mind thought of everything he could imagine . his fingers touched everything they could reach . his mouth said everything he could form into sounds . but for each job he told them he wanted to do , they told him a reason he could not or should not do it . one day , the boy saw an angel in the middle of the dusty field next to his house . this was a long time ago , so angels were not to be publicly acknowledged . but no one else was around , save for a few birds who might report the boy to the sheriff . the boy was willing to take that chance . he had never seen an angel , and wanted badly to learn about them . the angel , like all angels , was named erika . the angel told the boy that below this field is a world of renewal , a place that will let you be something different , something amazing . erika knew the boy wanted more from his life . ` ` underground , i can be anything i want ? '' the boy asked . ` ` you can not be anything you want , but you will be something you want , '' the angel said . ` ` and what is that ? '' the boy asked . ` ` like a doctor or a singer or a judge ? '' ` ` what you actually want is rarely what you think you want , '' the angel replied . ` ` so probably no . '' ` ` how will i know if i ' m going to like it ? '' the boy asked . ` ` how will you know anything ? '' the angel said and then ascended back to heaven , where they had some scones and a tall class of orange milk waiting . ` ` how do i get there ? '' the boy called . and faintly , from the clouds , he heard : . he did not understand what the noise meant . was the angel angry at him for asking so many questions ? his mouth was wet , even in the dry dusty desert field . he felt immediately hydrate . he spit . he spit again . and the dirt moistened into mud , dark and glistening like chocolate pudding . he spit and spit and spit , until the puddle was about 18 inches wide . his mouth was dry and swollen . he could not spit anymore . the boy reached his hand into the mud , and the earth gave way easily . it was a hole . he reached his entire shoulder in , then his head , his tarso , and finally his legs and feet . he was standing once again , but upside down underneath this world . everything was dark , but completely visible . and below him , the bright white of the new sky . he could see the under side of the barn , of the house , his sister had returned home , and you could see the warm tread on her boots as she stepped across the lawn . the boy saw worms and spiders and centipedes floating in the dark soil before him . he could feel them touch his cheek and teeth . and soon they began to nest le in his ear . he spent hours exploring every bug , every plant , every buried rock . he found some artifacts , like an expired shot gun shell . a lock box full of notebook long since rotted away . even the skeleton of a dog in a wooden crate . there was so much to explore , but he was getting tired . it was difficult to move around . he looked for the hole he had entered , but it had dried up in the hot sun . he could feel ants along his eyelids and the inside of his lips . he could barely walk . he tried spitting again , but soil had stuffed in his mouth . the sun had set , so he curled into a ball to go to sleep . he would figure out how to get home in the morning . he wished he could move . it began to rain , and from the under side of the earth , the weather sounded like this . after the rain , his arms felt longer , as well as his toes , but he still could not move . days passed and he few longer and longer . there was sometimes more rain , but mostly sun . one morning , after several months , he could actually feel the wind again on his face and on his back . when the rain came , it sounded like it always had , not that odd underground sound he had grown used to . and he realized he had finally begun to emerge back above ground . he wanted to run home , but his legs and toes had grown so long that they were entangled in each other , in rocks and in other plants deep within the ground . he was not climbing out of the ground , but growing out of it . his skin was greenish brown and wooden . he had little bulb tuft ed along the tips of his fingers and the top of his head . stuck in the earth , he had only to think about everything around him . it was what he always wanted from his life . he learned about photo synthesis and cellular division . he learned about mat ing habits of squirrel and birds . he studied the geometry of spider web s and the physics of stars . he spent a lot of time in those next several months watching his family , their grief at his loss . his parents ' happiness at his sister ' s education . aging , and the rapid breakdown of his parents ' bodies over the next many years . time slowed for him , and his knowledge grew so vast and so expansive , human triumphs and pains became only a small s liver of his interest . there were much larger systems to comprehend than humanity . in a decade , he had grown to over 20 feet tall . his sister , now an adult , approached . she touched the leaves growing from his chest and hips . the boy felt something he had not felt in a while , but he could not quite explain what it was . he tried to speak , but nothing came out . he had forgotten what he used to be . the boy was no longer a boy , but a tree . he did not know why a tree would want to speak . his sister smelled the tips of her fingers that had run along his leaves . she touched his bark , and she left . over the years , she would return and plant flowers near the tree . she would remove beetles that were burrowing into his body . she would sit beneath him and read a book , and he would try to read over her shoulder , but it was written in human language . these days , he could only read clouds and stars and moonlight . his sister would pluck fruits from him , great green bulb , like p ears but larger and filled with a bright pink flesh and teardrop-shaped grey seeds . she would cut them open and eat them while reading , the juice trailing down her chin and onto her cotton shirt and denis trousers . she sometimes collected his fruits in basket and sold them or made pies . eventually there was a man with her , later a child . one sunny spring morning she and the man and the child came to the boy , the tree , all wearing black . their eyes were swollen . the tree grew sad , knowing they had lost a family member , but he was not sure which one , or what a family member even was , or that it was one of his parents . the crying woman below him was his sister , but he could not remember this . his humanity was eroding , his botany flourishing . later that spring , the woman and the man and the child brought a picnic and some games , and the tree was happy , but could not comprehend why . nor did the tree intend to . the tree was simply happy , and this was a feeling that existed . years later , the family wore black again and cried . and the tree felt sad , but it did not connect this feeling to any kind of narrative . it was simply sad , and this was a feeling that existed . as the woman and man entered their old age , the tree did not understand their actions or their words or their behavior . the tree barely noticed them at all . but as they arrived , it felt good . when they left , it also felt good , or sometimes bad . the only things it understood were sunlight and rain and soil . the tree knew it might live centuries without being able to speak or move or bake or work in the field . trees could never be doctors , singers , or judges either , and this tree did not know why those particular human careers came to mind . but it loved examining the changing world with no ability to do anything about it . there was not to do , but feel . it had learned to cope with the itchiness of bug s , the sea ring pain of lightning strikes , and the embarrassment of birds . and it could stand all day and night , never ti ring of gaining more knowledge about weather and gravity and biochemistry . one day , more than a hundred years later in the once dusty field , now populated with grass , flowers and several more houses , an angel approached the tree and said , ` ` hello boy , i ' m erika . '' the tree did not hear the angel . the tree did not see the angel . the tree felt the angel , but had no understanding of the angel ' s presence . the tree understood so much of what there was to know about the earth . it certainly never learned to sing or test medicine or interpret laws , but these were minor details compared to memorizing the patterns of weather , the terrain of the moon , the motions of stars within an ever expanding universe . so the presence of an angel was not that big of a deal . the tree felt it had learned everything important there was to learn . the angel said , ` ` you ' ve yet learned so little . '' and from behind their back , erika revealed an axe . they swung wide and drove the blade into the tree ' s base . it hurt , and the tree remembered mortality . ` ` i am sorry this hurts , boy , '' erika said and drove the axe into the tree again . for most of an afternoon , the angel chopped and chopped , and eventually the tree fell . over a few days , the tree and the fruits and the separated stump died . but the tree retained everything . as its body was planted into boards , as its twigs were ground into much , the tree felt the knowledge of each seed it had planted across the valley , each creature it had nourished with its fruits , and each piece of lumber built into a home for generations of humans to come . the tree felt its branches burned in a fireplace , and it rose up as smoke and dissipated into carbon across the sky , coming down in trillion of molecule to build more soil , more trees , more creatures . the boy could truly learn everything now , cell by cell . it ' s been centuries , and the boy is still learning . he ' s inside you and me this very moment , learning about each of us . maybe one day , one of his memories will find its way into your own . maybe it will make you a singer , or a doctor , or a judge , or a baker , or even – another tree . and you will think of the boy who wanted to know everything and did . and then my mother would pat my head and say , ` ` good night , cecil , good night '' or so i imagine . by then i was long asleep . i hope you are too . stay tuned next for temporary oblivion , followed by a forgetful waking consciousness and good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : live every moment as if it was just one of the two and a half billion moments you have in your life .
WTNV|If He Had Lived|15 August 2016|1.intro . meg : and now . listeners of every kind , the voice of night vale , cecil baldwin ! cecil : sticks and stones may break your bones . that is just one of a number of things that sticks and stones may do . welcome to night vale . listeners , it is truly wonderful to be here on the radio with you tonight . wherever you are listening to this podcast , whether it is huddled in your car , hiding from a careless child who is whispering your name , or crouched behind your crouch , hiding from a careless child who is whispering your name . i d like to take this moment to welcome you all , so welcome – oh gee , ok ... i ' m sorry , it ' s a good thing we ' re on the radio tonight because u m , i just did this grand gesture of welcome and i accidentally knocked over some very important radio equipment . u m , but you ( would not - ) matter , it ' s all good . night vale , i ' m sure that you all know about the glow cloud . yes , that great glowing cloud that came to our town years ago , who continually drops dead animals upon our city . now at first , we feared it . i mean the glow cloud does have a tendency to take over our minds and make us say things that we otherwise would not , such as : ` ` al ll hail ll '' and : ` ` behold the magnificent cloud '' and : ` ` i put my forehead into the dirt and weep , oh great cloud that knows all things ! '' you know , stuff like that . or you ' ll be brushing your teeth and the glow cloud will just happen to pass by , and then you have to say all of that stuff with toothpaste in your mouth , you ' re like ` ` all hail cloud all hail the ` ` , and then you just end up with toothpaste all over your bathroom mirror . now mostly , we ' ve gotten used to the glow cloud . i mean , it is an active and productive member of our community . it even serves as the president of the school board , where it has gotten a lot done . because the other members of the school board just spend entire meetings chanting and praising the glow cloud . i mean it does have a child in our school system , and the glow cloud has never once completely destroyed our entire town so – i dun no , practically a model citizen . which is why it ' s very surprising what is happening right now . the glow cloud has left the school and is now covering above the broadcast tower of this radio station . i mean if we switch feeds , you can actually hear it . listen . so i ' m not sure what that ' s about . but you know what , we ' re just go n na move on with the show like normal , i ' m sure it ' ll be fine . what ' s the worst that could happen ?

deb : hilton brand international chain of hotels , suites , and residences . let me tell you cecil , and this is not prepared text , this is my honest feeling . the hilton brand international chain of hotels , suites , and residences is the consistent leader in business and leisure travel satisfaction when measured as a ratio against initial expectation and adjusted for projected consumer bias ( skew ) . and cecil , i truly mean it . cecil : great . deb : you know how the human body is so heavy with all its goopy weight , and so physically weak that you spend half of your existence sprawled out vulnerable and hallucinations ? cecil : do not i ever . deb : yeah . well , hilton has provided a place for you to do that . cecil : oh . deb : is not that kind of them ? it ' s like a big cushiony container for you to rest your human meat in , while your brain so desperately tries to escape existence . so just all of that . and i ' m presuming more . cecil : what ' s the matter , deb ? your heart does not seem into it . deb : oh no , i do not have a heart . i ' m a patch of haze . cecil : oh . i meant metaphorically . deb : oh , i do not have a heart metaphorically , either . you people are all just weird , squishy , playthings to me . but you ' re right , i am a little distracted . my sister is in town . cecil : you have a sister ? deb : why do humans always react to new information by re stating it as a question that they know the answer to ? yes , i have a sister . her name is caitlyn . caitlyn , caitlyn get out here ! meet cecil , the human whose radio show i take over whenever i feel like it . cecil : well i would not say take over my show , . caitlyn : how are a , i ' m caitlyn . cecil : u h , hi caitlyn , i ' m cecil . caitlyn : wo w , this studio is wicked small . you care if i overlap my haze with your body ?

and in order to do right by the glow cloud , our entire sales staff have built an idol out of rolly chairs in the break room . and they ' ve made these makeshift stained glass windows using dry era se markets , and all of them are swaying and singing around the effigy of their new found cloud idol . and all of them are naked ! and hr has already sent out a very sternly worded all-staff email about business casual guideline . i mean , from my window i can see the parking lot across from the station , and it looks like the lot attendants are repeatedly sprinting and hurling themselves into the windshields of park ed cars , and these sprints devolve over time into these loping zigzagging jogs as they shout the phrase ` ` we offer ourselves to the good of the cloud ! ` ` . i mean listeners , the glow cloud is definitely doing this . the glow cloud is obviously controlling their minds , so what have we done to deserve this , night vale i mean , have we not been good to the glow cloud ?

steve : okey-dokey ! the goal of jazz fe st is about discovering jazz . we want attended to find musicians they never would have found otherwise . jazz fe st begins at dawn at mission grove park . the moment we hear the first metallic creak of the sunrise , a solo trumpet will play an unbroken d-flat , as jazz lovers race out of the park past the sand wastes , down the gorge of ra don canyon , back up the other side , and then another 50 miles through a barren sandy nothing . cecil : wait , so it ' s not at mission grove park ? why is jazz fe st all the way out in the desert ? steve : well ho even knows ? a true jazz lover does not listen to jazz . a true jazz lover looks for jazz ! cecil : ahahah , yeah . steve : like i just said , jazz fe st is about finding jazz musicians , and who knows where they ' re hiding ? jazz fe st attended will fan out in small groups yelling , ` ` i wan na her a flute solo ! reveal yourself , jazz ! '' but then , as night falls and wildlife wakes up , the jazz lovers will grow cold and fearful . and just when they thought they have no energy left to actually find any jazz music , , they will be hunted by coyote ! chased by venomous snakes and circled by cultures ! as their lungs burn and their heart clamor and their muscles seize up , they will fall into the dry dust of the wilds ! they will hear a tenor sa x . they will whisper : ` ` son ny rolling ! '' they will crawl , their swollen gray and pink lips pulling sharp pains throughout their near lifeless bodies . but like all of the performing arts , the sound they hear will be a mi rage ! a meaningless series of tones bereft of musical weight ! this was never jazz . there is no such thing as art . and as the birds circle and ca w , the jazz lovers will beg for a swift and easy death . but it will be neither . the animals are very hungryyyyyy . nom nom nom nom nom nom nom ... cecil : steve , do you remember , do you remember last year when that guy from pine cliff found where esperanza spaulding was playing , but then , but then he held up his festival wrist band to show the bouncers , and then the buzzards came down and fully plucked out his eyes ? and then he was like ` ` no no i ' m fine , my ears are fine , i can still hear the jazz ! '' but then the bouncers noticed that it was for saturday only , and then they would not let him in ? steve : oh man , i must have watched that on couture like a million times ! cecil : steve : oh , i love jazz bloopers ! cecil : they ' re the best ! oh man , but seriously , how many people are go n na get attacked by birds at jazz fe st this year ? steve : oh absolutely all of them . cecil : great . steve : yeah . ah , anyway , all proceeds form jazz fe st go to support research for a cure to throat spiders ! cecil : ah , cool . steve : it ' s go n na be a blast ! oh goodness , i almost forgot the most important part ... cecil : oh actually steve , i ' ve just got ta get back to the community calendar really quick . steve : it will just take a second , i ' m double park ed ... cecil : no no , i i just steve : i´ve really got ta go before they tow the car ... cecil : it ' ll just take a moment , ok ? steve : okey-dokey . cecil : the community calendar , more on the community calendar . this thursday is skin health awareness day . while enjoying the outdoor can be fun , the sun is a dangerous thing . participating clinics will offer free screening where they will check your skin for unusual moles or ancient glyphs or birthmarks that fulfilled a prophecy , or burrowing insect colonies . the night vale medical board reminds you to wear sun screen and a hat when out in the sun . they ' re not sure how this helps , because the sun is essentially a million-mile wide nuclear explosion , but you know , hey , whatever . steve , what are you still doing here ? your segment ' s over . steve : you told me not to leave , you said you d just be a minute , ... cecil : steve , i ' ve got , like we have important things going on , you got ta go . steve : okey-dokey . audience member : we love you , steve ! cecil : no youth no , oh . cecil : thank you . thank you , steve carlsberg . ugh . he should moonlight as a chiropractor . and finally , friday are so much fun that we are go n na schedule all of our friday for this year all in a row , yeah ! oh yeah , it ' s go n na be nothing but finishing up that work week and then tearing carefree into the weekend . now the bad news is that the rest of the year will have no friday at all . but you know what ? that ' s a problem for future usssssss ! wink , . oh , future us ! 7. josh clayton . cecil : so , listeners . along with its other role as despotic god figure here in town , the glow cloud has also served the last several years as the president of the school board . now i wanted to take an in-depth look on how that has been working out . and so we have invited 16-year-old high school student josh clayton here to talk about his experience as a student under the glow cloud ' s leadership . hi , josh ! josh : hi cecil , it ' s so exciting to be here ! cecil : i got ta say you do not look 16. josh : oh yeah , i ' m a , i ' m a shapeshifter ... cecil : oh . josh : ... so i change my appearance pretty regularly . like sometimes i ' m a cat , but with human limbs . cecil : oh . josh : or sometimes i ' m a machine part from a 19 th century steam engine . my favorite forms are ones that fly , but my mo m gets really creaked out about those . so tonight , i chose the form of a 30-something podcast writer , because i wanted to look older and a little more distinguished . i , i , i think this form is pretty handsome , right ? cecil : no no , it looks great , it looks good . josh : ok , great . plus , looking older helped me ski p school so i could be here ! cecil : wait , hold on . does your mother know that you ' re using older looking bodies to ski p school ? josh : s-sure . cecil : good enough for me . so how has school changed since the glow cloud took over ? josh : you know , school is school , you ' ve got ma th class and english class , music class , music denial class ‘ cause you have to teach the controversy . cecil : sure , y up . josh : chemistry class , screaming class , it ' s my favorite . cecil : ah , yeah . josh : advanced cave survival class and then just to fulfill basic physical education requirements , several hours of armed militia training every single day . cecil : mm hm . josh : the glow cloud has not changed any of that , i mean we still have lunch and a morning break and a two-minute hate and stuff like that . cecil : oh yeah . josh : mostly things just work a lot smoother , the glow cloud is a surprisingly good administrator . if any of the teachers cause trouble , we find them the next day out on the football field , staring wild-eyed up at the stadium lights and muttering praise for an almighty cloud . for me personally , i ' ve been more affected by having the son of the glow cloud in my school . cecil : yeah , because the glow cloud ' s child is in your class and u m , so has that caused a lot of disruption or ? josh : oh n-n-no , i just meant i ' m really good friends with him . cecil : oh . josh : i mean , we bonded because we ' re both into super old retro music like u h , the killers ... cecil : oh . josh : or outcast . plus , obviously , we both know what it ' s like to feel different from all the other kid s . i mean he ' s a glowing cloud like his parent , and so it can be awkward for him to sit in seats that are not right for his body shape or wear those armed militia training uniforms for hours and hours . sometimes i take the form of a glowing cloud too , so he wo not feel so alone . cecil : www ! josh : and when he gets really frustrated because people mispronounce his name even though he ' s met them , like , a bunch of times , i try to cheer him up by taking a really silly form , like a butt . cecil : oh , ok . josh : or , or or , or a butt with wings ! cecil : www ! oh wait , what is his name ? josh : u h , ok it is a little difficult to pronounce because it ' s a lengthy series of lightning flashes and claps of thunder but i ' m always like , i do not know , if you cared enough you d learn . cecil : ah . so sideboard , josh you can transform into anything ? josh : i do not know about anything , there ' s just lots of stuff i have not tried , but most things i think . cecil : u m , could you demonstrate a transformation for us right now ? josh : oh , i do not think anyone would wan na see that , would they ? cecil : oh come on , it ' s on the radio it ' s ... no one will see . josh : ok . i - i ' ve been working on this one form that i think is really cool , it ' s like an entire cruise ship , but it has hundreds of insect legs on the bottom and then giant human face right on the front . do you wan na see that ? cecil : u h , yeah i do ! josh : ok well , this is go n na take up a lot of room , and it will almost certainly damage the walls in here . cecil : you ' re fine , that ' s fine . josh : sorry . one . two . th - oh no ! cecil : what ? what what what , what ' s the matter ? josh : my mo m realized i ditch ed school . i ' m go n na be in so much trouble . i got ta go ! cecil : no josh , do the transformation before you go , just do the trans ... ooooooh hohohohohoo , oh ! oh my god , he did not even mention the best part , the-the-the cruise ship with all the legs , it has a giant butt at the end of it ! oh man , i feel really bad for anybody that missed that one . 8. children ' s fun fact science corner . and now it ' s time for another edition of the children ' s fun fact science corner . alright so today , we are go n na try a neat little experiment to prove the existence of ghosts . yeees ! so what you ' re go n na need is a cell phone with a light on it . if you have one , go ahead and take that out now , do not worry , i ' ll give you a moment . now theoretical , you should be alone in a dark room , and i ' m assuming that all of you are alone in a dark room , since it ' s mandate that we stay inside at night with the lights out . and also no one wants to go out to public and share physical space with other people at a live theatrical event , i mean come on , who does that these days ? ok , so turn on that flashlight function on your phone and point it directly in front of you . now , if you look veeery closely , wherever the light is shining , you may see several human figures . but only the backs of their heads . their faces are obscured ! and these figures are lost and angry spirits , and perhaps you should not have disturbed them , so quick ! shine your light behind you just to see how many there are . oooh ! oh dear , you are surrounded ! there ' s hundreds more behind you ! and they do not look happy that you ' re shining a light in their eyes . and they look hungry ! so quick , turn off your lights and-and sink down really low in your seats , sink down really low in your seat and make sure that your phone wo not make any noise , because you do not want to give away your location to the hungry spirits . and hey , we just proved the existence of ghosts , you guy s ! sorry about possibly doom ing you . this has been the children ' s fun fact science corner . 9. tamika lynn . cecil : so listeners , during times of great danger here in night vale , we can always count on a brave group of completely unelected teenager to defend us . and they are armed with high power ed rifles and a love of books . we have the leader of that group here in the studio today , please welcome tamika lynn ! tamika : hi , cecil . cecil : hi tamika . you know , i always love having you on my show . tamika : www ! cecil : yeah you just know so much about literature and armed conflict . tamika : yes . my militia of book lovers and i enjoy sharing great reads with each other , as well as protecting night vale from those who wish to destroy us . we may be a heavily armed militia , but our greatest weapons – are books . books are full of knowledge , which is sharper than any knife . books are filled with empathy , which is more heart shatter ing than any bullet . and books are filled with beauty , which echoes across our land louder than any bomb . plus , in hand to hand combat , a hardcover fantasy epic is really useful ‘ cause those things are huge . cecil : oh yeah , . tamika : so just you know like , ba m right in the mouth ! as our promotion al material says , ` ` reading is fundamental '' , but we ' ve capitalized a few of the letters to spell out a more important message . cecil : oh sure , reading is fun ! da mental . tamika : no . cecil : oh . tamika : we capitalize the f a t , second a and l , ` ` reading is fatal '' . cecil : oooh . tamika : like i said , take the hardcover edition of marlon james ' ` ` swords and orderers adventure : a brief history of seven killing '' , then you know like , what someone right in the face with it . eight killing now , suck er ! cecil : ba m , ba m , ba m ! tamika : hack ! you know , i recently got a copy of roxane gay ' s first novel ` ` untamed state '' . ah , it ' s one of the most powerful books i ' ve ever read . it came with the launch codes for a nucular missile . cecil : wait , what ? really ? tamika : yeah , and that ' s not even a spoiled . it ' s right there are the beginning on the copyright page . 978-0-8021-221-3. you know , i thought it was her phone number at first , but when i dial ed it , i think i sent up a test launch instead . cecil : no wait tamika , i think that ' s the isn number . tamika : right , icbm number . cecil : no that ' s not what i , you know what anyway , . so tamika . you must have passed underneath the glow cloud on your way in . tamika : u h huh . cecil : did the glow cloud make any attempts to control your mind ? tamika : oh no . i ' m imperious to the glow cloud ' s attempts to enter my thoughts . you wan na know why ? cecil : books . tamika : what ? cecil : books . it ' s usually books . tamika : no . it ' s reading books , ( du r ) . books ca not do anything on their own , cecil , they ' re mere objects , pen and paper , but . books , while they are objects are themselves , you know , potential human actions , so my militia has the glow cloud surrounded and they are loading slingshots and reading selected passengers from ` ` midnight ' s children '' at it . cecil : oooh ! so you ' re go n na , you ' re go n na subdue it with magical realism ! tamika : oh no , we ' re go n na subdue it with the tear gas canister contained in the special 30 th anniversary edition of salmon rush die ' s masterpiece , so ... cecil : no wait , ok , tamika the glow cloud is , as indicated by its name , it ' s a cloud . tamika : u h huh . cecil : u h , so it has no respiratory system . tamika : ok . cecil : so if you shoot tear gas into it ... tamika : oh yeah ! p ff p ff p ff p ff p ff ! cecil : well then that tear gas is just go n na disperse out of it and then like , all ll over night valllllle . tamika : oh . ok , fair enough but u m , you know , i think i have a better plan . cecil : ok great , let ' s hear it ! tamika : ok , so . we take those slingshots . cecil : u h huh . tamika : and then we - all hail ! all hail the mighty glow cloud ! all praise the eternal lord above us ! human words are dismal noise , human knowledge is insignificant , electrical pulses in a squishy grey mass . lower yourselves before the omnipotence clouddddddd ! and then we finish off the cloud with the quick recitation of frederick fascia lorca ' s ` ` before the dawn '' ... cecil : oooh ! tamika : as my friend jessica fires poison darts at it , all while performing a killer barrel roll ! boom ! cecil : wo w , yeah ! i think that is the plan that ' s go n na work . tamika : ( – ) . cecil : tamika , thank you so much for coming on the show , and good luck ! tamika : thank you ! cecil : tamika lynn , everyone ! oh man , let me tell you , i ' m a suck er for a killer barrel roll . 10. oath of feat ly red . so before she does that , i ' ve actually got ta report that i ' ve not heard any animals smashing down on our roof for several minutes , so let ' s check in and see if our oath to the glow cloud worked . not at all , ok . alright , so everyone that ' s hearing these broadcast are for some reason losing their reality , and their-and their minds are hardening like clay and even if the glow cloud is nowhere near them , merely hearing this radio broadcast is enough to cause these problems . like streetlights flicked in erratic strokes and traffic cop s are waving and pointing in complex movements that are either completely meaningless , or dangerously meaningful . everyone at the moonlite all-nite din er has pressed their face up against the window , so if you were to drive by , you d see a line of flattened faces under glass made strange by the green ne on , as the din er ' s distorted lips and tongues mouth the words ` ` all hail the glow cloud '' . it is mass hysteria , absolute chaos , cats and dogs living together . which ... which is actually kin da common , now that i think about it . anyway , listeners . we must have done the pledge wrong ! somebody out there must not have said all the words , or held hands with that sweat sweat person sitting next to them . and so night vale , i think we have to do it all ll over againnnn . we got to do it right this time , so you know , get a sip of water or limb er up and stretch it out , because we must boldly demonstrate our weakness . and we must confidently express our unworthiness . ooh , and night vale , do the gestures this time , so use your hands . al ll of your handssss . here we go , night vale . the complete oath of felty , with gestures , repeat after me . all hail ! all hail the glow cloud ! to whom we offer our mortal serves . and our bodies . and our money . and our children . and our lives . which seems like a lot . but considering the smallness of the universe , it might be close to nothing . it ' s the thought that conts , right ? just like in that of henry story . you did not read that ? well , anyway , so ... all hail the glow cloud ! we give you our mouths so you know we mean it ! we give you our ears so you know we listen ! we give you our hands to do what you will ! ok , now we ' re go n na do the gesture that means all hail the glow cloud . you were all taught it years ago when the glow cloud first came to town , so we ' ll do it in unison on three . one , two , three , go ! yeah , i kin da like the sort of mysterious like ... hello . like you ' ve emerged from a curtain . all hail the glow cloud . back to the oath . all hail the glow cloud ! yeah you , you big lug ! we turn our mouths up to you for your authority is our strength and our nourishment and your forgiving strength is our guidepost so we wait for whatever action is next , whatever in the next moment in our existence , we accept this and are thankful , because your awareness is so limitless and our awareness is so limited and all we can do is cow er and ( take ) your praa-aaa-aaa-aaayers ! praaaaa- ( yer s ) . amen , or whatever ! night vale out . good work , night vale . i think that ' s go n na do it , i really do . i think that ' s go n na clear this right up , but you know what , we got ta wait and see . 11. public service announcements . and while we wait , here ' s a brief public service announcement . saving money can be difficult , especially for those just beginning their professional lives . but putting money aside for retirement or a rainy day is not impossible , especially if you follow the care program . that is c-a-r-e. c : cut costs . by making your own coffee every morning , you can save up to 20 dollars a week . you can also cancel unnecessary entertainment services that you do not use very often , such as movie streaming , rent , and health care . a : automatic withdrawal . put aside some of your pay , tax-free , into a 401 k account . r : rob a bank , because who cares ? that bank teller sure does not . those banks are insured up to here . and finally , e : chew ( - ) currency . now the us dollar is not backed by anything , other than a promise that it is worth anything . and to this collective societal pretense that there is value to these disease-ridden paper rectangles , featuring long dead super problematical men . whoooooo ! so go live in the woods and make your own currency . and pay your creditors with animal hides and handmade art . simply follow the c-a-r-e program and you ' ll be saving money in no time . worst case scenario – you go to prison , for printing false currency or robbing a bank . so honestly , what have you got to lose ? 12. check the recording . oh dear . u m , listeners , i have to report that glow cloud related behavior are continuing to deteriorate in town . frances donelson , who is the owner of the antique mall , is hanging by all four limbs from a light fixture in her store , and her eyes have rolled back to the whites , and she is chanting praise in a language that no one can understand . fire chief among incarnacion has lit a great fire in the sand wastes in the shape of the glow cloud , and also made a public statement that , ` ` fire safety should be top priority when lighting great flames of tribute to gods who care not if we live or die . '' and then the fire that incarnacion lit spread quickly , and the entire barista district had to be evacuated . yes , from my station here , i can see a long line of refugee baristas carrying behind them their express machines , hand decorated tip jar s , and poorly executed paintings of birds . so everyone that ' s hearing this broadcast is acting as though under the mind control of the glow cloud , and the person who seems immune – is me . so i do not get it . why am i the only one who ' s immune , and why is everyone that ' s hearing my show , affected even though i am not ? you know what we could do . we could actually go back through today ' s broadcast , and and we could see what is trigger ing certain events . ok let ' s do this , let ' s go back and listen and see if we can understand . so so this the audit from earlier , when i was talking about the u h , horoscopes . recording/cecil : oh magnificent glow cloudddd.. cecil : what ? recording/cecil : i grovel before your glimmer ing vaporrrrr ... cecil : ok , i definitely did not say the word ` ` glimmer ing '' . recording/cecil : witness my words , i am definitely saying this to you u , ooh glow clouded ... cecil : alright stop stop stop stop stop ok , ok it does not match what i remember but that ' s ok , just ski p ahead a little bit , u m yeah this is u h , ski p ahead to the community calendar . u h , this is me talking about those theater additions . recording/cecil : we are lowly beasts before your magnificeeeence ... cecil : what ? this does not , no stop stop stop stop stop , this does not make any sense . you know what , we had other people on the show today . u m , what about when deb was here ? play me back that hilton ad . recording/deb : oh absolutely cecil i agree all hail the glow cloud certainly ... cecil : what ? recording/deb : that cloud ' s a wicked pisseeerr ! cecil : alright , alright ! alright alright alright alright ! this ca not be real ! but i do not get it , you ' re hearing me , right ? wh a ... or what if – all of this is only what i think i ' m saying ? go with me on this , what if right now when i think that i ' m doing my normal mundane news report from my normal mundane american town ... what if i ' m actually not in control of my voice or my body ? i mean , what if right now when i think that i am talking to you on the radio , what if my voice actually sounds like this . night vale ! this is the glow cloud ! i am the glow cloud speaking to you ! through the voice of your host , who has been mindlessly chanting since the beginning of his show . i will speak with you directly ! but first , it turns out there are radio station requirements that not even i can break ! and so , my worshipping public , i give you – the weatheeeeer ! 13. weather . ` ` see me '' by mal blue http : //malblum.bandcamp.com/ 14. the glow cloud speaks . the glow cloud : hello night vale . oo o . it is difficult to adjust to communicating in this manner , so i ' ll attempt to be less boooomyyy and shouty . i ' m used to interlacing directly with my thoughts , or pulling my glow with many colors . but when i flash those brilliant colors across the firmament , you run from me . and when i try to enter your thoughts , you twist my words into fearful praise and awe . i have no vocal mechanism of my own , i must speak through your mouths and voices , i ' m trying to communicate with you . it is not my intention that you worship me . i just want to talk ! just like , have a conversation . it ' s been so long since i had a conversation . i ask you to look at me and you say ` ` all hail '' . i say , no please , acknowledge me , and you say ` ` all hail ll '' . i say no stop that , thank you , and you say ` ` all hail ll the mighty glow cloud '' . i do not think you see me for who i truly am . only what you assume i would be , and i can not control this process . i have tried , i have been trying for years . plus i do have this - embarrassing habit where i drop dead animals from my body . but i ca not help it ! it ' s a medical contiooooon ! and the animals that i drop from my body were dead to begin with . i love animals ! i would never harm an animal ! especially not turtle . oh listen , do not get me started on turtle , i love them the most . did you know that sea turtle have salt faltering glands , so that they can continue to swim while they drink sea water ? listen , ok , listen , do not get me started on the turtle , alright ? humans of night vale . i have spent millennium wandering this earth , trying to communicate with humans and instead only being worshipped . and i thought that night vale might be the place where i could finally live a complete life . but it turns out people hear a deep booming voice within their minds and they must chant praise . so instead of entering all of your minds at once , i ' ve entered the only one , who in many ways is the voice of your town . night vale , my message for you is simple to say , but not simple to act upon . and my message for you is this : do not worry about being good to me . be good to each other . now this is not a passive command , to not be bad is not the same as being good . to be good means to actively reach out and to actively help and to active support someone . being good is an action , not a description . there are terrible forces in this world , night vale , forces that seek to do your harm . and your only defense is not by not doing bad things yourself or by admitting that bad things just should not be done or supporting those who would do bad things , it is to go out into the world , and be good to friends and strangers alike . be good in the streets , be good in so many glorious and creative was that the world will eventually take notice . as george eliot wrote in her hit pierce brosnan screenplay , ` ` golden eye '' , ` ` what do we live for , if not to make life less difficult for each other ? so let us try this . all hail . now i know i said do not worship me but , you know , i have grown rather accustomed to the whole all hail thing , so let ' s keep it for now . but in a greeting sort of way , not like a worship sort of way , right ? so , all hail ! yes and a lovely all hail to you as well ! see how nice that is ? and then if you like you can give a little all hail to the people next to you , maybe an all hail to the people behind you ? if you have someone ' s permission , you may take their hands and look them deep in the eyes and synchronize your breathing : ‘ cause that ' s not creep at all . you give them an all hail . and most importantly : do not look down upon them , and do not look down upon yourself , simply be there with them , present , sentiment , human . ah yes , the oath , now . the gestures and the structure of the oath that you had were indeed correct , but the words , they ' ve been twisted over the years into fearful praise and awe . and so , with your permission , i would like to each you the actual oath . yes ? repeat after me . now we take an oath . not to a glowing cloud , but to each other . we are present , all of us . present in this promise we make . to speak up when words are needed . to be silent and listen when others should be heard . to use our actions for good . behold our collective acts of love . love of every kind . and now , now night vale we do the gesture , yes , the gesture that means that life is not worth living unless you use your words and your actions to make others ' lives better . you know the gesture , we ' ll do it on three – one , two , three ! hm mmm . u h huh . all hail ! all hail love and action ! not ( worshipping words ) . all hail all of us ! amen , or whatever ! thank you . we will feel a fire tonight to do good ! but that fire will dim over time , as we begin to think , ok somebody else be good to everyone else because i literally can not today . but no , we must kindle this fire over and over so it burns ever brighter with our words and our actions . and so night vale , i hope that my voice has reached you , and i hope that i can go back to being president of the school board . and i hope that i can get susan tillman to finally schedule the bake sale for the band trip , just susan , pick a date and get it on the calendar , that ' s – that ' s all you got ta susan , just la la la la , that one , i do not care , pick a date ok ?

pamela : i dun no , man ! is she single ? cecil : pamela ! pamela : i mean , she is also super mean and emotional distant . the complete package ! cecil : pamela ! we ' re on the air ! pamela : cecil , are you going to keep staring at me like that ? take a picture , it ' ll last longer ! better yet , paint a picture , it ' ll take longer ! better yet – picture a picture . imagine a picture of something . tit could be me . it could be this radio station . it could be anything . a dog , a pizza , a dog with a pizza draped on it . a landscape of rolling hills , tumbling fields , plummeting cliffs , slump ing trees , unhinged birds flying in listless , mournful circles because they know they ' re just pictures in your head and that their existence is not only fleeting , it ' s also illusory . they ca not even remember their childhood , because they were never born . only in vision . god , that is so selfish of you , cecil ! cecil : what ? pamela : you , you did not even imagine parents or a family for them ? what kind of bird-hating monster are you ? these birds do not ever get to be fed by a mother or , or go to bird pro m or pass a driving test or go to college . god ! you have let us down . myself and the imaginary birds , cecil . now it ' s on me to pick up the pieces and give them lives you never could . now i must imagine their histories and then think of them ceaselessly . lest in a moment of careless reality , they vanishhhh . cecil : now wait a minute ! birds are just flying robotic camera designed by a vague , yet menacing government agency , that much i know . pamela : just because something is not alive does not mean it does not have feelings . cecil : ok , alright . so , so are you here to deliver an emergency press conference or what ? pamela : well , i mean , i was but then your spokeshaze got me all distracted , you know ? now i ' m helping imaginary birds re discover their childhood . i ' ve had a real busy day . cecil : ok . pamela , any comment on the glow cloud ? pamela : fine . citizens of night vale , denizens of earth , space people , silent witnesses from a dimension outside time . i speak to you now under a great glowing cloud which controls our minds . i am here to give emotional support , to communicate emergency protocol issued by the city council , and to offer pithy quotes for your news outlets . things like : ` ` you can not control fear , you can only hope to enjoy it . '' or ` ` unity - it ' s a thing we could do '' . or b , ` ` unity is both and activity and an area . '' or ` ` hey girl , did it hurt ? when you fell from heaven ? ‘ cause i do not believe in heaven so your story does not really add up . '' ` ` i mean , what really happened , did you trip ? '' cecil : ok , alright pamela ? pamela , focus . pamela : the important thing is that we honor those that we have lost . cecil : oh no ! have there been deaths ? pamela : billions of them , cecil , like everybody dies , has no one told you this ? i mean , my mo m told me on my 30 th birthday , i ca not believe you ' re now just finding out . cecil : ok , no i meant today from the glow cloud ! pamela : eh . night vale , keep doing what you ' re doing . but in the meantime , start envisioning those birds . i need to take a nap , so i need somebody to pick up the slack for the next , like , six hours . cecil : whooooa . you take six hours nap s ? pamela : i dun no , cecil , i ' m just a monogram . well , see you later , vanishing now ! cecil : pamela . you are just making those noise with your mouth . pamela : u h , sorry cecil , i ' m fading out , ca not hear you so bee p bee p bee p bee p bee p bee p ... cecil : oh , oh looks like she ' s backing up , and there she goes . ladies and gentlemen , pamela mitchell ! god , bird pro m , how could i forget ! whoa . 16. bonus track : michelle nguyen cecil : so listeners , this thursday afternoon is the night vale jazz fe st , sponsored by the last bank of night vale . for more on that , we have in the studio one of night vale ' s pre-eminent music experts and owner of dark owl records . please welcome michelle nguyen ! hi michelle ! michelle nguyen : hi cecil . i ' m very excited about jazz fe st . it ' ll be at mission grove park the entire weekend . there will be a variety of musical acts as well as arts and crafts , food truck s , and dozens of predator cats let loose by the night vale z oo to keep kid s occupied . every family will want to go sit under the cool ( – ) of early evening , suppressing the pain of living by listening to hours of jazz . cecil : ah . you know , you sound like a really big fan of jazz music . michelle : what ? ! cecil : oh . michelle : gross . no , i ' m just excited because everyone in town is going , which means i can sit quietly in my record store without having to talk to any customers . cecil : you know , michelle , some day i would really love to see your business plan . michelle : i do not have a business plan . cecil : you do not say . michelle : business is a machine , a sausage press that grind our souls into sludge and slurry , as we ' re all compact ed into intestinal sleeves and made to look uniform and hang from hooks . business destroys individuality . it ' s for that reason that i threw away my original plan , which was a crude sketch of noel gallagher being eaten by a gollum made of cocaine . cecil : of course , because i forgot that you went to business school . michelle : yes , but now i do this shop only for the art . i no longer accept cash , because i do not believe in capitalism . customers must now describe their favorite kinds of rocks in order to take an album . plus i carefully curate the music i make available at dark owl records . cecil : i mean , you do have a small but very impressive music collection . michelle : not just what i have . i also curate what i allow people to take . people have the worst taste , and it ' s my job to inform them of how awful they are for the kind of music they like . cecil : mm , mm . but then you educate them about better music , right ? michelle : what ? cecil : ok that ' s cool michelle , i totally get it , you ' re a misanthrope . michelle : no , cecil . you think i hate people , but that ' s not true . i do not like people . hating them would require me to care about their existence , which sounds like the worst . i open my record store ( – ) to provide music for night vale , that ' s all . music is important , even if the people who buy it are not . cecil : well , i got ta say that i really ( did ) enjoy that ed sheer an album that i got at your store last week . michelle : this is exactly the problem , cecil ! i want people to enjoy good music , but they just ruin everything by not knowing what good music is ! cecil : i mean ed sheer an is fantastic . i mean i ' ve been listening to it over and over and over and over to prepare myself for the jazz fe st . he has totally re ( - ) that keyboard fun k movement , and i mean the 17-minute experiment solo in the middle of ` ` shape of you '' . that is the most innovative free from jazz since hayn left one direction . michelle : do not think i do not know all the jazz gr eats , cecil . john coltrane , anita day , aerosmith . but just because someone buy s a mile davis poster or has an elba fitzgerald l p , or a clipping of roy harbour ' s mustache hair , that does not make them a music expert . people never sit and listen to what music really is . cecil : ok , so what is music , michelle ? ok , ( – ) . michelle : shut up and listen for a second . the sound of ventilator . the sound of polite british laughter . the sound of overcompensating british laughter . the sound of a birdcall . the sound of thousands of high fives . crowd member : michelle : the sound of someone who needs attention . all of it , music . cecil : wo w . that is so beautiful michelle , i think now i understand what music is . michelle : you do not . cecil : no . michelle : ok , i have to go . maureen and i are going to spray paint some birds along the old bridge . cecil : oh sweet , so now you ' re into making street art ! michelle : no , we ' re going to spray paint birds . cecil : oh , ok . well cool . thank you for coming on the show . michelle nguyen , everyone ! 17. bonus track : sheriff sam cecil : we have a figure of authority here to guide us . listeners , they have now broken down the doors of the station with a battery ram , and they are now ka rate chopping any employee in their way , and they ' re now entering the studio , a and they are now walking up to the microphone right next to me , waiting for me to stop talking and introduce them , which i will do at the end of this sentence , which admittedly has probably gone on too long and has too many clauses and has at this point just gone on way too long , but you know what you can do because sometimes sentences just get away from you , but then again listeners – it ' s sheriff sam ! sheriff sam : hello , night vale ! fear not , your sheriff is here to set all things right ! for instance , i just ka rate chopped those people ! cecil : u h yes , yes and they seem quite injured . sheriff sam : well yes i think so , i ' m great at ka rate chopping ! so that ' s one thing i did about the situation today . but there will be more things . it ' s time for the law to take charge , cecil . i believe in law and order . cecil : law and order . sheriff sam : yes . i know the phrase is absolutely meaningless , but it ' s a fun nonsense pneumonia that helps me remember . law – and - order . layers are why andros never dare obtain , rudely , diamond engagement rings . cecil : aah , yes that is an excellent way to remember the correct arrangement of those letters . sheriff sam : there ' s been an absolute ( rash ) of andros stealing engagement rings . right off people ' s fingers when they ' re doing normal everyday activities like u m , basketball , checking the mail , and holding their hands out to the andros . cecil : oh , u h , that is just awful ! i mean , we all hold our engagement rings out to andros from time to time , right ? i mean just before the show , i was holding my own ring out to a group of andros . it ' s a ring that has a stone in the shape of a beak er and then it has the gold filigree wrapping around it that says ` ` i ' m really interested in science these days '' . and like ( they ' ve got tiny dents ) . anyway , any of those andros could have just grabbed it ! sheriff sam : exactly ! well , this is where the layers come in . i bought a lot of them , and they are pointed at all of the andros . if any of them so much as try to touch an engagement ring , ba m ! ba m ! cecil : then the andros just like explode ! sheriff sam : no . but then they have a lot of little red laser dots all over them , indicating that they are a thief . ba m ! they feel such shame . if i were to identify the thief , i do not know what i d do . they are very sad and i could sit down for a while . i feel like i could not just get up and walk out into the sunlight , even though i know that i d feel better the moment i was standing in the sunlight and objective ly walking a few feet and standing in a different place seems like a simple thing , but the barrier between the me that was sitting there and the me standing in the sunlight would seem insurmountably , and i would begin to cry . cecil : sam , are you ok ? sheriff sam : i ' m fine . it ' s just we ' re getting away from the point . which is law and order ! cecil : yes . and what is the law doing ... sheriff sam : and order ! cecil : yeah , and-and order going to do about the glow cloud ? sheriff sam : the glow cloud ? cecil : yeah , that ' s theatre crisis that we are facing . sheriff sam : to be honest , i did not really look into all the details before coming over . i ' m a person of action , not foresight or insight or any other kind of sight . so what ' s all this about a cloud ? cecil : u h , u h , i mean look up ! sheriff sam : hm m . oh ! huh . well that looks difficult to arrest . i might need to get a special set of handcuffs made . i do like it when i get to look through the handcuffs catalogues . it helps me to keep up with all the latest fashions . cecil : well , i mean please hurry sheriff sam , because i dun no how long the city is go n na be able to hold out . sheriff sam : do not you worry about this city . let me worry about this city . you worry about , i dun no whatever you civilians spend your silly days worrying about . the economy or rising sea levels , reality to programs about cakes , match ing socks . let me handle big stuff like clouds . cecil : excellent . well , u h , thank you very much , sheriff sam . sheriff sam : thank you cecil and remember : law and order ! cecil : yes ! law and order , i will remember about those andros . sheriff sam : what ? now , law and order ! lawyers argue with annoying needlessness to despite obviously right deputies explaining reasonably ! thanks , cecil , and goodby future possible inmates ! cecil : alright , thank you very much sheriff sam ! and ... oh yeah , there they go ka rate chopping anyone that they missed on their way out . oh , oh no ne il ! oooh . i ' m so sorry , ne il . oh well . 18. bonus track : inter geoffrey cecil : in the meantime , i think that we need to get a better understanding of why the glow cloud seems to be having this adverse effect upon our listeners . now , probably the best move is to pull up all ll of the meteorological records over the past few years , and all ll the school board minutes , and then track them against surveillance records of everyone in town over a five-year period . now , this is going to be a truly tedious and thankless job . so let ' s bring on an inteeeern ! inter geoffrey : hi boss , i ' m your inter , geoffrey cranor . cecil : oh , inter geoffrey , hello . inter geoffrey . you must be new . geoffrey : i am . have you noticed that you ' re constantly having to hire new interns ? cecil : oh yeah , because our interns always die . geoffrey : wait wait . you ' re just go n na , you ' re just go n na say that live on the air ? cecil : oh , well you did not let me finish , i was just go n na say that our interns always die eventually . i mean , everybody does . geoffrey : not me . cecil : oh . geoffrey : i ' m not go n na die as your inter . see , i ' ve learned to deal with how scar y and random the world is . cecil : by just accepting it and moving on . geoffrey : no , by tinker ing with reality til it suits my needs , so ... cecil : ah ! geoffrey : like , i used to be terrified of flying , so so what i did was , i spent decades developing a rudimentary time travel system and then systematically dismantled the chain of events that led to the invention of the airplane . cecil : what is airplane ? geoffrey : exactly . of course tit sort of backfired in this timeline now , because in the airplane ' s absence , a significantly less safe form of air travel was invented . cecil : oh , oh oh i get it , so these airplane are kind of like the big catapult and then cushion system that we have now . geoffrey : that seems to be so yeah i was , it is sort of entertaining in this current history that when the wright brothers were like flung from a three story tall ( - ) , but they had not figured out the cushion part of the system yet . oh , yeah . cecil : yeah . geoffrey : it was an important but mess moment in history . oh oh and plus , charles lindbergh , right , being the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , that was a far more impressive feat , right , than what he ' s currently known for ? cecil : oh , of course , you mean the first guy who ever had his big cushion taken away because he was such a big old racism , right ? geoffrey : right . yoink ! cecil : no madam ! geoffrey : yeah , maybe not such a huge loss . cecil : yeah . so i mean how did you get over your fear of airpines or whatever , and also what other fears did you conquer through the power of time travel ? geoffrey : i was really afraid of spiders . cecil : because you ' re so afraid that if you see one , you ' re go n na freak out because they ' re so cut e because they ' re just like , om g i love you , and the spider ' s like om g i love youuuuu ! pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling ! i love youuuu . be a . geoffrey : let ' s say yes . cecil : ok ! but wait a minute , spiders are still here , you did not get rid of them . geoffrey : no no no , i-i tinker ed with my genetic before birth , and i turned myself into a giant spider . cecil : aaaaaah ! i was go n na say something about that , because you were totally not a giant spider when you walked in here a few moments ago . geoffrey : ah , technically in this timeline i was , you know it does not matter . my thought process behind doing it was , you ca not be afraid of what you are . cecil : mm hm ? geoffrey : yeah , yeah . yeah turns out most people are afraid of what they are , so now i ' m also terrified of mirrors and reflective surfaces , so ... cecil : oh , o-ho-ho-ho-ho ! geoffrey : it ' s not a perfect system , but but ! i will use my powers to make my my dying as your inter impossible . cecil : oh , and and and and what is your plan for that ? geoffrey : i will go back in time . cecil : mm hm . geoffrey : and prevent my own existence . cecil : what , oh . what ? geoffrey : see if i never existed , i ca not be an inter and if i ca not be an inter , ca not die as an inter . cecil : yeah but could you just like not become an inter to begin with , or or or you could just like walk out of here right now and and and and choose a different career path and never look back . geoffrey : no , i think time travel ' s the only way to be totally sure . cecil : oh , ok . alright . oh , oh hey . before you go , geoffrey , i have this huge research project , and i know you ' re go n na era se yourself from history , but would you mind taking care of this before you go , is that alright ? geoffrey : sure , as a matter of fact i just now went back two weeks in time , already finished it , it ' s sitting right there on your desk . cecil : oh , oh ! geoffrey : so now i ' m go n na go back to before i was born and if all goes well , i will never have gone back in time , because i wo not have existed , which i think , i think , technically means i wo not have been able to prevent my existence , which means i ' ll reappear here , but then in appearing i ' ll prevent my own existence again and then disappear . you know what , quantum physics just works itself out . cecil : yeah , ( it ' s on just this ) . geoffrey : alright , wish me luck boss , goodby . cecil : alright . thank you , inter geoffrey ! ]
WTNV|Are You Sure?|1 September 2018|is this the first time you ' ve heard me say this ? are you sure ? welcome to night vale . ok , i ' m starting again . as many of you certainly noticed , we are having a problem of timeline divergence here in night vale . events are happening over and over , and each instance is different than the last . earl harlan , sous-chef at tourniquet , was preparing a fresh salad with wood blue vinaigrette , and decided to do a spina ch base , but then he was preparing a fresh salad with wood blue vinaigrette and decided on a romaine base . the same event twice with practically different outcome . also there was that tragic story from the night vale daily journal about that plane that crashed at night vale international airport but – when we looked at the paper again , tit was a really boring story about a plane that landed safely with no unusual incidents . it was a stunning tragedy , and a totally mundane event , simultaneously , and it is unclear which of those really happened . my husband , carlos , whose long perfect hair was looking unusually perfect , does not know what is causing these fracturing timelines . he ' s been busy in his lab saying that he is working on an incredibly important project related to this , and he needs to see it through . meanwhile , a mysterious figure in a black satin mask stood on top of the former flakey-o ' s factory watching this chaos unfold . who is this figure ? and what do they want ? more soon . or , maybe just this again , but with a slightly different wording . we ' ll see . and now , traffic . two roads diverged in a yellow wood . and so i decided to take both . being one traveler , i split myself good by a process i barely understood . a third me slithered ‘ death the undergrowth . through the trees i could see myself walk , merely me but i started to hate him . for if i ' m real , then he is the mock . we turned as one , as one began to talk , each quoting the other verbatim . i shall be asking and asking why , two operations of myself hence . two roads diverged in a yellow wood and i took them both , and many others beside . it turned out , there never was a difference . this has been traffic . this splitting of timelines in town has only gotten worse . and it seems that it is connected to the mysterious figure in a black satin mask . wherever they go , things happen , and also happen differently . and also happen even differently than that . when the masked figure visited the library and asked for a copy of ` ` the artist ' s husband '' , that hit novel about an artist and a time traveler who get married . the librarian began keeping and banging on their cases . but also , they got very quiet . several librarian escaped , but also they did not escape . and several bystanders were hauled by those loose librarian , but also they were fine and went back to their homes saying things like ` ` wo w , uneventful day today . '' and , ` ` nothing exciting has ever happened to me and i ' ve never been injured . '' when the masked figure stopped at the ralphs , week day shift manager charlie bear accidentally spilled a box of cereal in aisle 3. kellogg ' s cereal of course , since no other cereal is allowed in town anymore . but at the same time , charlie spilled kellogg ' s cereal all over aisle 5. which is the cleaning supplies aisle . he was not sure how that even happened , but it did . and at that exact moment , the ralphs was not a ralphs , but instead a von s . now this is truly getting baffling . how do i report on a story that is many different stories at once , all contradicting each other ? and just who is this mysterious figure in the black satin mask ? further up dates when more is known , and possibly simultaneously not known . and now the community calendar . monday is pizza night at the last bank of night vale . come by for this fun community event that features free pizza , a dj , and paperwork that looks like a football sign up sheet , but actually commits you to a predator loan . meanwhile , monday is karaoke night at the last bank of night vale . come and join our employees in song . unfortunately we planned this slightly last minute , and so the only cd we could find was a collection of nature sounds . so do your best to sing along to such hot numbers as ` ` rustling leaves # 5 '' , ` ` miscellaneous beach noise '' , and ` ` two hours of bubbling brook '' . then monday is art gallery night at the last bank of night vale . do you make art ? why ? just what are you trying to prove ? do you think you ' re better than us ? yeah , come-come try to justify yourself this monday night at the last bank of night vale . and finally , monday is the annual kid s fundraising dinner at the last bank of night vale . cater ed by night vale ' s own earl harlan . join this fun and delicious celebration as we raise money to kid s . which we will then give to the kid s , no strings attached . i wonder what they ' ll spend it on ? huh . something was off about this community calendar , but i ca not put my finger on what . i mean looking back , it seems normal . kind of a light week , only one event . monday night at the last bank of night vale is a garage sale . they have all sorts of weird stuff , people are put in safe deposit boxes , and it feels like a waste leaving them sitting there . come and make an offer . so that ' s normal . not sure what it was . carlos has reached out to me with a concern . he said he ' s busy at work on this problem , but given that events have been turning out with wildly different outcome , how will we know which outcome is true ? this day will end however it ends , he said . but how will we know the ending we experience is real ? what if resolving this crisis is merely another splitting possibility , and at the same time there ' s us still dealing with the crisis ? and that is a very real concern . i guess i can only say that it ' s uuuuh ... a gut thing ? i mean i feel like when this is resolved , we ' ll know the real series of events , we ' ll just know them , you know ? because they ' ll be the ones that actually happened . carlos tells me that gut feelings are not scientific , but i said , ` ` well what are gut s made out of ? science , right ? '' and he had to concede that point . then i told him his short cropped hair looked – more perfect than usual , and he blushed . still , i ca not , , i must keep carlos ' concern in mind as this day wraps up . i-i ' ll need to pay attention and make sure that what is happening is the only version of that event , and there are not stray versions sprawling out their own timelines somewhere else . and now a word from our sponsor . today ' s sponsor is ... huh , okay . hm m , they just sent a video tape with the labels torn off of it . i guess i ' ll watch it and describe what i ' m seeing . it ' s a black and white shot of a kitchen , a man is making a sandwich , it ' s a falafel sandwich with cucumbers and tomato es and he eats the sandwich , smiles at the camera and leaves the room . now there ' s a big red text thing , u h ` ` there must be another way '' . now we ' re back at the kitchen and the man is making a sandwich . he seems confused , as though he remembers having just done this . in his confusion , as he is cutting the tomato es , the knife slips and oh my god - oh my god ! oh , he ' s screaming but now that same text ` ` there must be another way '' and the , the man is back making the sandwich and he ' s still screaming , u h but he realizes his hand is intact , and he goes to the phone u h to make a call and he slips and bangs his head on the counter and he falls out of frame and the text says again ` ` there must be another way '' . and the man is back and and , and he ' s pale and shaking and he ' s feeling his head , and he ca not believe it ' s not broken open and he runs to the door and out into the yard and the camera follows him , and it ' s not clear who is film ing , and there is an earthquake and and a service opens up in his lawn and he disappears into it and again , ` ` there must be another way '' and he is back in the kitchen and he ' s weeping . how long is this ? ok , it , ok it looks like this tape is at least three hours long , so i ' ll watch the rest of it later uhhhh , and kind of summarize . maybe then we ' ll figure out who is even sponsor ing this thing . the diverting timelines disaster is only worsening . and night vale of course has no mayor to deal with the issue . except that sometimes we do have a mayor and sometimes it ' s dana cardinal , and sometimes it ' s pamela mitchell , and sometimes it ' s a tall obsidian statue with wings and a thousand faces , and it ' s not clear which of these timelines are real . the sheriff tried to restore order saying : ` ` listen , no matter what timeline you find yourself in , just maintain a calm disposition , lie face down wherever you are , and wait for a secret police officer to collect you . '' but the problem is that anyone is following these directions finds that they have simultaneously not followed those directions . and so the problem does not seem possible to resolve . meanwhile , the worst of the effects are following the figure in the black satin mask , although nothing more has been learned as to who they are , or what their role in all this might be and so ... ah , listeners ... the masked figure , they walked into the station , and they ' re standing on the other side of the control room glass . they are reaching up now and pulling off the mask . oh my god it ' s ... hold on , i need to deal with this . let ' s go to the weather . the alternate versions start here earl harlan ending listeners , i ca not believe it . the masked figure all this time was my old friend , earl harlan . earl stood there , a black satin mask in hand , with an even more solemn than usual expression . ` ` i did not mean for this to happen , '' he said , his eyes filling up with an ink slackness . ` ` that ' s the most important thing to remember . okay , cecil ? '' ` ` okay , '' i said . ` ` but what exactly is happening ? '' he pressed his phone to the glass and showed me a text conversation he d been having with his son , roger . it was a string of femoris , mainly the waving arms octopus , plus the minotaur with sun glasses , plus the movie theatre on fire with a marque that has a picture of another movie theatre on fire . ` ` do you know what this means ? '' he asked . ` ` yes , '' i said . ` ` no , '' i said . ` ` i ' m not really sure , '' i said . ` ` roger wants to go out with his friends tonight , '' earl explained . ` ` they want to walk blindfolded into the desert with their backpacks filled with rocks . '' ` ` that sounds kind of dangerous ? '' i said , not sure what this had to do with the timeline problem . ` ` i know , right ? '' said earl . ` ` but if i say no , roger will be mad at me , and his friends will think he ' s cool , and i really do not want roger to be mad at me , and friendships are so important at that age . they ' re just so intense . i mean i was nineteen for a really long time , i know what i ' m talking about . '' ` ` right , right , '' i said . ` ` but , the timelines . '' ` ` also , '' continued earl , ` ` my assistant keeps asking if we ' re doing coquette or funnel cakes for the kid s fundraising dinner , but i just do not know ! i mean , whatever we choose could change the course of the night and our lives forever . i finally had to block her number . and then i ' m supposed to pick the colors for the new boy scout uniforms . dry blood red and khaki brown , or fresh blood red and khaki green ? i ' ve gotten to the point of wearing a black satin mask so no one can recognize me and ask me to make any more big decisions today . i ' ve just , i ' ve never been good at things like this . '' earl ' s eyes were shiny and dark as oil slicks . ` ` like earlier , at von s ? '' he said , ` ` m-my shopping list had one thing on it . i was there for six hours . i walked out of ralphs with nothing . you d be surprised , cecil , how often i leave that store with nothing at all , feeling dazed and starved and exhausted , my empty reusable canvas bag flapping against my side in the hot wind . '' and i tried to reassure him that we all do that , but he did not seem to hear me . ` ` some days , all i do is think about the things i could have done , '' earl said . ` ` like i keep having these visions of this one moment that i ca not even really remember . i-i was in a car , order it , it was on a porch , when the light burned out , or it was in a brightly lit halfway with a party going on in the next room , there was something , i-i did not do , some thing i was afraid to do , and told myself i could do it later when it felt less scar y but some opportunities only happen once before they become unattainable forever . do you know what i mean ? '' after a moment , i said ` ` yeah ? '' earl ' s head tilted back . darkness beamed from his eyes until the daylight outside was stained to night . ` ` car . porch . halfway . khaki . blood . coquette . octopus . minotaur . movie theatre , '' he chant ed , until the words became just rhythmic , guttural sounds . finally , earl ' s phone vibrated . his head un-tilted and his eyes stopped beaming as he fished around in his pocket . it was a text from an old friend . a very old , very good friend . they had not spoken in some time , not really spoken . not like they used to . it said : ` ` hey , i know it ' s been a while , but i just wanted you to know . i think it ' s kind of cool that you ca not make choice . like , maybe that makes you more of a part of the universe and less of an impact or upon it . maybe we could all be a little bit more like that . know . '' earl felt suddenly relieved , as if many years of heaviness had lifted . the slackness in his eyes receded , and the sky grew light again . ` ` yes , '' he said . ` ` why do i have to make choice at all ? why do any of us ? '' now the friend had may not have meant that exactly , but at this point , there was nothing he could do to take it back . ` ` no more choice ! '' earl said , shutting his eyes tightly . and then he walked down the halfway , out the door into the too-bright sunlight of dawn , and then he walked down the halfway , out the door , and then he walked down the halfway , out the door . since this moment , citizens agree that one reality remains in night vale , and that it ' s the correct one . hot take . i ' m not one hundred percent sure . i mean , i thought i d have a gut feeling , but i just feel i dun no ... unsettled ? i feel like i have to look at everything that happened today , and just keep looking at it until it makes sense , know ? hm , speaking of gut feelings , i ' m getting up dates that the ralphs no longer stocks kellogg ' s cereal , and in fact stocks one product in every aisle : castellano brand colossal squad stuffed with their own viscera , which i understand is an important spanish ta pas . great appetizers for your dinner parties , or just for complete meals , snacks and all sustenance from now on . ralphs : for all your shopping needs involving castellano brand colossal squad stuffed with their own viscera . i need to make sure this was how it actually turned out . i need to begin again . is this the first time you ' ve heard me say this ? are you sure ? welcome to night vale . today ' s proverb : this one real trick does not seem to have any real purpose . but maybe give it a try anyway . telly ending listeners , i ca not believe it . the masked figure , all this time , was telly the barber . yes ! telly ! who soon after my carlos came to town with his beautiful and perfect hair , gave carlos just a hideous hair cut ! it was an affront to all that is good in this world . and in his rightful shame , telly fled into the desert , howling his regret to the night sky and giving wild haircuts to the cacti . no one in town has spoken his name in years . and now here he is , apparently destroying our timelines . is there no end to the crimes that telly can commit ? telly was weeping , and he shouted through the glass window of my booth : ` ` i ' m trying to make it right ! '' and he was fogging up the window and that was annoying and i could hardly hear him , so i told him to come inside . ` ` i ' m trying to make it right , '' he said at a more reasonable volume . ` ` i ' ve been trying to change the past so that i never gave that hair cut . but it has all been going wrong ! instead of changing the moment of my vile hair cut , i ' ve been splitting every possible point of divergence in all of the timelines of night vale . this is not what i wanted . '' telly , what a mess ! and that was when carlos arrived , and i could tell he had come in a hurry because he was wearing his casual house lab coat , which he does not like to be seen in . he mostly wears it to bed , or you know when he ' s doing the dishes , but that was the least of it . his hair was going through a truly bizarre transformation . as i watched , it kept radically changing lengths and and sty les from a mohawk to a shaved head to ana gorgeous hair stretching halfway to the floor ! his hair could not stay the same for longer than a few seconds . and then carlos said ... well , hear for yourself . carlos : oh , telly ! i had thought it was me . i had thought it was my fault . you know , in the lab , i had managed to track the source of the timeline divergence to soon after i came to town . and like that made me afraid somehow that my presence was causing this . i was too ashamed to say so even to my husband , because what would it mean if this was rejecting me somehow ? but now i understand . i got that hair cut from you right around when i arrived , that ' s where the source of this is . and , and telly – can i just let you know , i really liked that hair cut . cecil : but telly would not listen . he shouted : ` ` that hair cut ruined my life ! i regret it every day , i must fix it ! '' and he started middling with the device he had invented to change the past , and that is when things truly took a turn . night vale vanished . and the three of us – were standing on an empty desert plane . and then night vale was back , but it was different . a neon-studded city at night , all futuristic flying cars and citizens with downturned eyes hurrying back to their dingy apartments . and then we were in space , somewhere in the far flung battlefields of the blood space wars , and around us were explosions and thousands dying and then , we were back in the radio booth again and telly was weeping and weeping . and carlos put his hand on telly . ` ` stop , '' carlos said , ` ` stop ! '' and telly stopped . then carlos said ... carlos : listen , telly , the hair cut was great . i loved it ! so maybe cecil did not like it . maybe no one else in the entire universe liked it , i do not know , i do not care ! because i loved it . and i got it for me . you have nothing to be ashamed of , you never did ! come back to us . come back to us and re start your life . you were one of us all this time ! cecil : so – telly did . he moved back in from the desert and has reopened his barbershop . he has resumed friendships with people he had only thought hated him , but instead , had been giving him his space . there had been a misapprehension on both sides and that had led to years of dis connect . years that were finally healing . i still think that hair cut was a crime , bu ut , my husband tells me my opinion on that does not matter so o ... . the timelines in night vale have settled down . everything is only happening once and only in one way . it seems the day has been saved by carlos ' superhuman forgiveness and perfect hair . or was it ? because as carlos said earlier , how can we know that this is not just one timeline ? and somewhere else there ' s a night vale where this all happened differently , and what if that ' s the real night vale ? well , there ' s only one way to find out , listeners . i ' m go n na start this broadcast again and see if it turns out the same way . is this the first time you ' ve heard me say this ? are you sure ? welcome to night vale . today ' s proverb : how do i love thee ? let me tally up all the points i ' ve assigned to your personal value with respect to my needs . leann hart ending listeners , i ca not believe it . the masked figure all this time was daily journal editor leann hart ! leann shattered the control booth glass , leapt forward and thrust a well polished hatchet to my face , pressing the sharpened blade against my cheek . hatchet are tools common among print news professional for threatening internet-based publications , so i could not understand why i was her target . i said , ` ` leann , i ' m a radio host , not a news longer , i ' m not your enemy . '' ` ` oh i know you ' re not , cecil , '' leann said . ` ` i'm-i ' m not threatening you . i ' m just showing you the new hatchet i bought . it ' s pallidum , cost me a fortune , feel that , so nice . the metal stays cool and soft but it cuts through bone like a copyeditor through adverts . '' and then we both laughed , ` ` ah ha , '' i said , ` ` this is an extremely funny joke that only us true journalists would understand . '' ` ` the word ‘ extremely ' was unnecessary there , cecil , '' leann growled pressing the blade tighter to my face . ` ` that is a nice hatchet , leann , '' i said . ` ` but-but how did you afford it , there ' s no money in media these days unless you have a true crime podcast ? '' leann smiled . ` ` wait . did you start a true crime podcast ? '' i asked . ` ` because that would be a great idea to murder a bunch of people , and then do a podcast about it . '' ` ` i have something even better , cecil , '' she said . ` ` i have – time . '' leann said she time traveled over and over throughout each day , and then selling newspapers across hundreds of concurrent timelines . she increased the number of days she could sell papers , but not the amount of time or labor involved . she made millions . she tried to stay out of the stories , not wanting to change the arc of our future , but no matter how objective she remained , the repeated day was always different . so she gave up trying to stay disinterested and began to actually influence each event . now there was a car chase on route 800 last tuesday , and in one version , the sheriff ' s secret police stopped the subject without violence and then took him to jail with lots of violence . in another version , the suspect got away by fleeing on foot out into the scrublands . and in another version , leann hart thwart ed the suspect from ever stealing the car in the first place , thus saving police from endangering themselves and others and protecting the car ' s owner from an awful day , followed by months or arguing with an insurance company . but leann found that this third version did not sell papers , because there was no story . what proved most lucrative was an on going fear amongst the readers needing to know how this horrible crime would be resolved . weeks of a fugitive on the loose led to weeks of great sales . as the city filled with angst , fought for more police protection , and formed theories about who the criminal mastering was . ` ` oh yeah , i remember this story now , '' i told leann . ` ` we never caught the guy , did we ? '' ` ` oh we did , '' leann said . ` ` i mingled the timeline where he was captured , but only because the story stopped selling papers . i needed something more exciting so then , i convinced this psychopath who had been murdering stray animals to instead poison the town water supply , and we all died . that was a bad one . no one bought a single paper . '' ` ` leann , you ca not do this . you ca not keep traveling through time and manipulating our fates to sell papers , '' i said . ` ` it ' s ethical , immoral even , to make money by ruining lives . '' and then she said i must hate capitalism an called me a socialist and – i did not have a comeback . ` ` i ' m giving up the time travel thing anyway , '' she said . ` ` also i promise to stop creating dangerous news stories to sell papers . '' i told her it must have been a tough but fulfilling journey through her own soul to elevate compassion for others above personal gain . i told leann i was proud of her decision . and she said negative news stories did not really sell anyway . ( – ) from time traveling she had cultivated a large sample size of sales data , showing sustained emotional arguments based around raw fear were the best approach . and the daily journal from this point forward would be exclusively op-ed . and with a gleam in her eye , leann showed me tomorrow ' s front page headline : ` ` public schools should not give pornography to our kid s . '' ` ` oh , they ' re handing out pornography in school ? '' i gasped . ` ` i dun no , '' she said . ` ` the point is that they should not be doing that , whether they are or not . ` ` we ' re go n na sell a bunch of papers , this will be a story for weeks . '' and i agreed . it ' s a good idea to sell papers with only half informed opinions about non-existing issues , i mean it saves on time spent searching and reporting and , more importantly no water will be poisoned , no cars will be stolen . irrational headline will initiate helpful discussions and friendly debate , with absolutely no harm done . leann left the office and told me i could report her story , but only on embargo until the daily journal scoop ed it . so that ' s why it ' s taken me a week to tell you this . or at least ... i ... i think it ' s been a week ? you know , i wan na make sure . this was how it actually turned out . i need to begin again . is this the first time you ' ve heard me say this ? are you sure ? welcome to night vale . today ' s proverb : true change starts with the person in the mirror . he ' s standing far behind you , barely visible . he ' s really going to change things .
WTNV|Fall Football Preview|15 September 2018|there is no i in ` ` team '' . this has been a partial list of letters not found in the word ` ` team '' . welcome to night vale . the night vale high school scorpions kick-off the variety football season this friday against last year ' s district champion , red me sa . following the announcement this summer that scorpions ' head coach , nazr al-mujaheed , would be taking a sabbatical to deal with personal matters , night vale promoted defensive coordinate lutrice beaumont to head coach . she has ten years co aching experience and was a former line back er for the scorpions during their headway as four time state champs in the late 1990 ' s . this is a historical hire for the high school football program , as lutrice beaumont is the first remind to become head coach . beaumont called a press conference this morning to talk about her team and her co aching staff ' s expectations for this season . ` ` after only one win last year , '' beaumont explained , ` ` we wanted to change our approach entirely . instead of a plotting , run-focused offensive , we want our starting quarter back , sophomore junius duncan , to really throw that ball around , just chuck that leather ( wad ) any direction he wants . '' beaumont ' s team motto for 2018 is ` ` we will win , all the time , right now '' . junius duncan has a small frame at only 5 ' 4 '' and 120 pounds . but he has eight legs and can leap up to 20 times his own height . he has struggled with his accuracy in training camp , as he has zero arms . and the spiny tips of his front legs cause the ball to stick and sometimes def late . senior running back prince reynolds , who led the district in rushing last year , returns in full health . coach beaumont said reynolds has been working on his upper body strength in the off-season by install ing hydraulic joints on each shoulder . we ' ll have more on the up coming scorpion football season in a moment . but first , a look at traffic . lisa farmer does not like her job . she does not hate it , either . to lisa , a job is a paid dare to sit in a chair for 10 hours every week day for 40 years , for a little over a million dollars , paid out in bi-weekly installments . she commuted 35 minutes each way to her office . during this time , she thinks about the divorce papers her attorney gave her , but that she ' s never filled out . she thinks about her husband ' s lack of motivation . she thinks about having children . not whether to have them , but the actual process of birth . she sometimes offers up an involuntary laugh , a reflex response to the forced laughter of the fm drivetime talk show . she forgets all of this when she arrives at home or work . time pours from her like water from a broken pipe . all this time , lost to memorable travel . she measures her life in traffic ja ms , a mathematical equation that proves nothing . commuted are the limbo of the week day . everything is stasis . expect delays . this has been traffic . in her opening press conference , night vale scorpions ' head coach lutrice beaumont said there were some rule changes this season that will affect her team ' s approach . first , helmet to helmet hits , normally assigned a personal foul penalty , will now be subject to game ( elections ) and possible suspensions . officials are also cracking down on end zone celebrations . many fan s felt the elaborate displays of joy exhibited by players last season were not in the spirit of good sportsmanship . the most egregious example was when cactus park ' s mille whiteside scored the game-winning touchdown against pine cliff . he and the rest of his team mates then performed in the end zone the entirety of the tony-winning musical sensation ` ` wicked '' . district head of officiating , jake camp , announced : ` ` i ' m tired of selfish kid s making a team sport all about them . in my day , when we scored , we would calmly hand the ball to the re f and jog back to the sidelong head down . maybe . '' he continued : ` ` maybe , u h , a more religious kid might offer a quick prayer to the brown stone spire , an unobtrusive gesture of kneeling , cutting your finger open , drawing a nine-pointed star with your blood , as your team mates danced about shortness and chanting something in ancient akkadian or greek , but nothing ostentatiously like what kid s these days do . did you see that one kid who did a backflip ? a backflip ! this is football , not cirque du sole il , son ! '' camp shouted . he added that millennials are killing everything good in the world . one reporter reported that current high schools are not even part of the millennium generation . another reporter pointed out that camp is 33 years old , which makes him a millennium . camp paused and said , ` ` you wan na be like that ? fine ! '' camp then begun to grunt and strain , his face darkened to a deep violet , as long white hair gushed from the top of his head and out of his chin . his posture weakened , his back now hunched . wrinkles formed around his eyes and lips , and his skin loosened . he then said hoarsely : ` ` i ' m 93 now . so you know where you can put that millennium comment of yours ! '' the reporter assumed camp meant the sport section of the newspaper , so that ' s where the reporter put it . in the middle of beaumont ' s press conference , assistant coach christopher tis dale whispered into her ear and she frowned . when asked to elaborate , she said she d just received word that another new rule is that all players must have two or fewer legs . which prohibit her starting quarter back , junius duncan from taking the field . upset by this sudden change , beaumont cited the golden retriever who was allowed to play basketball for cactus park back in 1997. they named the dog air bud , because the dog was the former ce o of an airline . admittedly , the dog was terrible at basketball . he ran in circles and barked at the coach for treats , while opposing tea ms took huge advantage of the five-on-four dispatch . but according to beaumont , a precedent was set for multi-legged players . oh , this is terrible news . junius must be devastated . beaumont ' s press conference is still going on . we ' ll get back to it soon . but for now , when the first bolt of lightning struck the sea , and the first apex of rock crest ed the tumultuous ocean , the elders among the stars brought life onto the earth . these children of sawdust became humans , became authorities of their tiny planet . they created science and art , and they worshipped their lactic forebearers . but their hubris grew in them like a cancer , and they abandoned the benevolence of their creator . the vigilant determination of life leads only – to death . an ironic ouroboros to be laughed at by the elders of the cosmos . diet pepsi . humans are a knock-knock joke of the gods . let ' s take a look now at night vale high school ' s district rivals this season , starting with last year ' s champs , the red me sa ant carpenters . red me sa returns their starting quarter back , senior salmon talib , who leads a dynamic passing offense anchor ed by junior wide receiver , trunk p ham . p ham ' s quick feet , 6 ' 5 '' frame , and nearly 20-inch antlers allow him to break free from smaller defenders . the pine cliff liza rd monitor return with the league ' s top offence . everyone in pine cliff is a ghost , making them quite elusive , but the f lip side of that is that their defence is terrible . in terms of total tack les made last season , they finished dead last . p un not intended . but p un certainly embraced , because it ' s not bad . oh ... ah a ? a-ha . i ' m getting word from my producer i an that is in fact a bad p un , in bad taste . i an ' s grandmother was part of the great cataclysm of 2008 , which turned all of pine cliff into ghosts . he says it ' s no laughing matter to those living in pine cliff . too those residing in pine cliff , so . i ' ll go back to the part where i said p un not intended . one team to watch out for this year is the cactus park shark nurses , who have a strong defence but who have struggled with turnover . the shark nurses ' senior running back patrick lyre had 20 fumbled last year , but said he focused on his ball carrying technique in the off season . coaches worked with lyre to carry the ball high and tight against his shoulder pads , instead of in his cargo shorts ' pockets . desert bluff , which has not had a team nor a high school for the past three seasons , has incorporated in some desert otherworld and will be returning to district to play this year . league officials are concerned about the capriciousness of gateway between our reality and theirs , which could lead to visiting tea ms becoming lost in either a time loop or disappearing altogether . theoretical physicist celtic dummond from desert bluff junior college said : ` ` if you only focus on the bad , you ' ll never see the good ! '' not much is known about this cultures team other than they ' re probably – terrible . finally , there ' s another new district rival this season , the whispering forest high school wood dogs . whispering forest high opened in 2016 after the forest incorporated as an independent township . no humans live in the whispering forest , only trees . really polite trees , always with a quiet compliment . but if you accept one of their compliments , you too become a tree in their forest . fun fact : whispering forest is the fattest growing town here in the desert . urban planning experts think that the positively emanating from the whispering forest has been a real draw for people seeking new homes . they ' re unable to determine why a need for positively suddenly became a factor in like 2016 , but there it is . the wood dogs are sure to be the largest and touches opponent in night vale ' s district , but also the lowest , as they are literally trees . their real strength wo not be in their ability to score or sack the quarter back , but to recruit entire opposing tea ms to their side before the game ends . that ' s a look at night vale high ' s rivals this year . coming up , we ' ll check in with coach beaumont and her team strategy for 2018. but first , a public service announcement . friends of the night vale public library announced the annual used book sale is this saturday afternoon from 10 to 5. librarian will hang books from invisible twine attached to blade-based traps , inside a complex cornfield labyrinth . according to the press release , which appears to be written by a detached human finger dipped in its own blood , these are ... great books by great authors like george saunders , cousin ha mid , and delete no . books you really should read . books you ' ll want to reach out and grab , without noticing that the earth below you is lightly covered in branches hiding a spike-filled pit . so come down to the library for the used book sale . no need to shower beforehand , your natural scent makes you easier to track . this has been a public service announcement . coach beaumont has finally completed her pre-season press conference , and she finished it off with quite a statement . when asked what the overall strategy for this year would be , beaumont said : ` ` surprise ! '' but she said it just like that , with her eyes wide and arms raised and there was a looong silence as the reporter waited for what was to happen next . the energy faded as beaumont slowly lowered her hands , a lone cough came from the back of the room . beaumont then continued : ` ` oh , our strategy is surprise . we do not want our opponents to have any time to prepare for us , so we schedule every single game simultaneously . all five division rivals will play us at once , '' she said . ` ` we kick off in like five minutes . i should go . as the leader of this team , i ca not be late for the national an them , the pledge of allegiance , the aldrich chant of national unity , the secret police helicopter fly over , and the pre-game blood stone bacchanal dance . '' now the reporter frantically shouted the rest of their questions . ` ` are you going to protest your quarter back ' s disqualification ? '' ` ` how will you compete against five tea ms at once ? '' ` ` how many balls will be used ? '' ` ` where do we go when we die '' and ` ` what is football ? are you a football ? '' but beaumont had already left . i ' m getting word that the game has kicked off at the night vale high school . now i ' m not a sports fan , but even i ' m intrigued . i got ta see this . u h , let me take you now to the weather .
WTNV|The Mudstone Abyss Part 1|30 September 2018|kevin : the phrase ` ` beautiful smile '' is redundant . welcome to desert bluff . hello , desert bluff , it ' s kevin ! i know , i love your smiling face too . it ' s an other sunny day in our second inclination of desert bluff , here in our vast otheworld . we ' re all pleased to be under a benevolent sun who never leaves us , even at night . just always in a fixed point in the sky like a father , dedicated to watching every move his children make , burning hotter at every mistake . and gently warming us with each moment of pure thought . it seems like only months since i arrived here with the dream of re-establishing my true home . this is a metaphorical dream , not literally the shared dream we all have each and every night , where we ' re standing in a reaped corn field as birds zig and zag across a blood red sky , recklessly turning and swirling in panicked fits until crunching into the rocky soil below , their wings bent and bodies broken . every one of us in town has that dream every single night . what a true joy that we all share that unconscious narrative together . but i ' m speaking here of my figurative dream . the dream to rebuild desert bluff , and oh , how beautiful it is to see that dream fulfilled ! we have built homes , restaurant , a city hall , public bike shares , public knife shares , an amusement park , and even a church ! my church . the desert bluff temple of joy . as you know , i have written many texts on the smiling god through the years , detailing my visions and the many holy messages of our destroyed . one day , we shall all be devoured , eradicated by the beast . swallowed and digested , our sinew peeled from bones like a barbequed rib . our skin bubbling away from the creature ' s digestive fluids , and our serves – completely purified . also , please know that we added wednesday night children ' s services starting this week . so bring those kinds and let them know the good news ! everything in our new desert bluff is perfect . and by starting my show with that statement , i ' m certain i have solidified this perfection in perpetuate . let ' s have a look now at the community calendar . this thursday night the desert bluff limestone appreciation society will get together in back of the jewel os co , to look at a piece of limestone that gerard diaz found under his own tongue ! gerard will show any member of the society and their guests the limestone nugget , but he will not remove it from his mouth . so if you wan na see it , you need to request a viewing by pinning gerard ' s arms behind his back and then prying open his jaw . friday is of course the smile parade , as we do every friday in desert bluff . we will shut down all business es and schools and come together on pleasant street , right in front of city hall , that beautiful mound of mud we built last spring . and we will all stare deep into each other ' s eye sockets and smile . smile so hard we weep , as loud dance music plays and we all stand still . tears streaming down our cheeks and onto our teeth . see you there ! and sunday afternoon , the desert bluff community players will be putting on arthur miller ' s classic play ` ` death of a salesman '' , an immersion bit of theater where the audience gathers at the bedside of a gravely ill person who worked in sales . the crowd stands and watches the person until they die . i love this play ! i was in it in high school . i played happy . i told you earlier how much it ' s meant to me to have the town of desert bluff back in my life . but really , it ' s the people more than the buildings who make it so wonderful . like grand ma josephine o'toole , who used to live in the far edge of old desert bluff . josephine had a lot of demons . they lived with her and helped out around the house by eating light bulb and giving strangers ten dollar bills . when night vale annexed our city , josephine and her demons came to live here in the otherworld , and they ' re just as happy as ever . there ' s also savannah hernandez who used to live in red me sa . she heard about our fledgling city from a low-flying helicopter and thought it sounded like a great place to hide from us tax collectors . so last year , she moved to desert bluff ! and now she ' s married to hesse pritchard and they ' ve had four kid s ! agnes , age 2. arm and , age 4 , and twins poland and leon , ages 14 and 17 respectively . some people even came to desert bluff as refugees of the blood space war . like olin haworth , chant al james and krotshk , a small but dense neuron orb from the forehead fibula . i even know of one person , ran nicholas , who did not know desert bluff existed or how he got here . he told me he used to live in a place called ala-bam.. ala-bah , all allahbamaa ? alabama . he was in his fraternity house at school , and when he walked out the front door , thinking he was going to go join his friends at a party , he walked straight into this desert and the door behind him was gone ! ran ' s first few months here were tough . he missed his friends and family . but everyone here in desert bluff convinced him that we were all his friends and family now . ` ` just look at our smiles ! '' we shouted , as we surrounded him . that ' s the kind of warmth and kindness only a true small town can give . and of course there is that new man . he came into town today . who is he ? what does he want from us ? why his perfect and beautiful smile ? why his perfect and beautiful teeth ? teeth like a stairway . he says he ' s a geologists . well , we have all been geologists at one point or another in our lives , but why now ? why here ? and just what does he plan to do with all those religious text books in that house he ' s renting , over by little rick ' s salad stand ? anyone could make a salad at little rick ' s . anyone . well , as far as this new citizen , my rhetoric questions are simple wants to answer . his name – is charles ! he ' s originally from cactus park and spent the last few years living in pine cliff , doing a study on why everyone who lives there is a ghost . charles said he simply wanted to live in desert bluff . he said this desert otherworld is the most theological interesting place in the us , after pine cliff . a town where everyone is a ghost is pretty hard to beat interest wise , he said . charles is 41 years old and wants to settle down , become a teacher , and raise a family . charles is a welcome addition to desert bluff . he ' s someone i d really love to keep my eyes on . so to speak . right now at city hall , mayor lauren millard is now announcing her plans to build a public library in desert bluff . she ' s talking about the joy of learning and the comfort of books ! people seem quite happy about our new mayor and her ideas to improve this town . a large gathering of smiling people have amass ed in downtown to hear about mayor millard ' s budget for this new project . libraries certainly are helpful municipal resources . they have miles of shelves filled with novels , periodicals and reference books , which have been carefully curate to make readers happy . there is no bad news in a library . i think this is a good idea that lauren has here but – i d love to see a great idea . hang on , let me text her . ` ` what about a monument , a tower '' – no . ` ` a chasm , a deep sculptor pit showing our dedication to the smiling god . announce that instead . love , kevin . '' ok , it looks like mayor millard has stepped back her support of the library , and is now pitching her incredible idea to build a great monument to smiling god , one to rival night vale ' s brown stone spire . of course , none of us agree with the religious beliefs of the brown stone spire , but we all certainly respect its towering beauty . broadcast ing its dogma across the desert through the medium of colossal architect . mayor millard announced that the desert bluff monument will be a great pit called the redstone abyss . a one-mile wide , four-mile deep inverted cone chiselled with sacred symbols and texts , dedicated to the smiling god . it will take a year to build and will require everyone in town to work on it . the crowd is now shouting at the mayor in obvious support . lauren has always been good with people , a real motivator . i ' m excited about her great plan . let ' s have a look now at traffic . there ' s a single car , a maroon hon da cry , one tail light out , driving along state street . inside is a man listening to his radio . he ' s new in town and he wants to hear all of the important news of his new home . perhaps he even wants to hear my voice . a voice first heard earlier today when he arrived in town and i was standing at the sign that says ` ` you are entering desert bluff , population : all smiles '' . the man ' s name is charles , and when he looked at me , he smiled . he shook my hand , lingering a bit . i told him how welcome he was , how win some his jaw looked , how i d love to show him around town . and charles , who is now turning his cry onto lighthorse pass toward the house he rented , listens as i say on the radio : few people have ever looked at me with equivalent kindness . you did not turn from my face . you did not wince . you looked straight into me and knew i was the same as you . you saw me , charles . thank you . there ' s road work to fix a rip in space-time along havana drive . so expect delays , charles . you have my number . this has been traffic . i ' m getting word that people are unhappy somewhere in desert bluff , and this makes me unhappy . i do not like being unhappy . that ' s not what this town is about . apparently the unhappy people are at city hall , complaining to mayor millard about her new plan to build the redstone abyss . they ' re carrying signs with read ` ` separate church and state '' and ` ` libraries , not forced labor '' . they ca not be upset about the redstone abyss ! perhaps they ' re upset about the mayor ' s lackluster delivery of such good news . was she not smiling enough ? sometimes people do not smile enough when they bring good tidings , and that makes those tidings much less good . i will call the mayor now to help her clarify her message . in the meantime , let ' s have a look at the weather . spoiled : it ' s going to be cloudless and sunny with no wind . but still ... ok , we ' re all good . i went downtown and the mayor and i talked . she brought in the city council , which is made up entirely of my close friends ken , kelvin , began and ellen , who founded the temple of joy with me . we all walked back out to the gathered crowd , and lauren called for calm , but no one reacted . then i stepped to the microphone , and everyone stopped and went silent , save for a couple of gasps . and i said : ` ` the mayor wants to build the redstone abyss , and support her efforts . the city council supports her efforts . and i believe you support her efforts as well . i can see your smiling faces , but i want them to be smiling even more . and to help you with that , i will tell you my vision of this monument , of the smiling god . one night , after waking up in a cold sweat from that same dream about the frantic and suicidal birds and the empty cornfield , i felt so invigorated by the permanent of this enjoyable dream that i went for a walk . i walked and walked until i came to the mountain , the single mountain that overlook our town and upon which stands a lighthorse . i climbed to the top of the lighthorse , and i started up at the midnight sun and i asked for a sign , but none came . for hours , i waited , but none came . so i walked back down and i found an old oak door . i opened the door , and on the other side was a dusty park lined with tall obsidian walls and populated with hooded figures who were playing some game that involved kicking a french can into an overturned trash bin . i asked them for a sign , but none came . they made a static hum and pretended i was not there . so i shut that portal and i thought then about that famous scripture from the book of devouring . ` ` when the smiling god closes a door , it opens a great hole in the earth . '' and so i grabbed my smile knife , which i always keep in a case on my belt , and i begun to dig . i scraped away mud and stone until i had no energy left , and i said please , give me a sign ! and below me , the ground became translucent . i could see for miles down , a great pit below me , and crawling up the sides of the pit was an enormous creature with thousands of legs , scuttling joyously in an upward spiral until it finally devoured me in one gulp ! but rather than become pure in the holy ma w of our smiling god , i found i was standing once again at op the lighthorse , at op the mountain , at op all of desert bluff . and below right here , next to our small but proud city hall , i could see a conical abyss of awe some size , glowing with symbols of our god , interlocking triangles and multi-legged worms and just the most detailed geometry carved into redstone . and i knew that this great construction was not merely our future , but our conscience , our very soul . this redstone abyss will be not a monument to a god or a religion or a church , but to our happiness itself ! so i tell you now that we will build it , and we will build it together ! '' and as i finished my speech , i could see dozens of grinning faces . several of our friends from the temple of joy had come to hear the speech and to help out by holding down the protesters and pulling their lips back into full smiles . the city council immediately approved mayor millard ' s plan . she ' s such a visionary and brilliant orator ! construction on the redstone abyss begins at 7 am tomorrow morning , so we ' ll see all of you there , bright and early ! it was a joyous day , desert bluff ! a defining moment for our town . and to top it off , i got a call from charles ! he said he heard my speech today and was impressed with my homiletic skill . and also , he d love to take me up on my offer to show me around town , and that maybe we could start with dinner . well , i will let you know how that goes ! but as always , until next time , desert bluff , until next time . today ' s proverb : on second thought , a million dollars is pretty cool . finger guns to you , million dollars !
WTNV|The Mudstone Abyss Part 2|14 October 2018|kevin : age is just a number that counts quickly upward to an ending point . welcome to desert bluff . hello , desert bluff ! let ' s start there . let ' s start with a greeting , a simple hello and of course , a huge smile . then let ' s move right into the good news , the happy news . charles and i went on our first date many weeks back , and it was magical ! i met up with him in the new town square , which is a sand du ne with a cow skull on it . i was wearing my best rabbit fur overalls and rainbow-striped head band . he was wearing a rose gold lame cravat and soccer shin guards . we went to eat at desert bluff ' newest restaurant , ver million , which specialized in lip meat . we shared a bottle of cabinet and talked comfortably about all the things you should not talk about on a first date . politics – we ' re both theocrats - , religion – we were both raised in the arterial faith - , sex – we both have had it – and banking . we had some polite disagreements here . later we went back to my house next to the temple of joy . it had been a long time since either of us had had - well , i do not wan na share too much . so i ' ll ski p to the next morning , where over coffee we talked about our dreams , or rather dream . it was that same shared dream that all desert bluff citizens have every night with the birds flying in seemingly random directions over the cornfield before crashing their bodies into the ground . charles , being new in town , had a lot of questions about this dream . but i said that the dream is nothing more than a simple pleasure we all share as a community . it ' s fun to know that the whole time sometimes wakes up at the exact same time , sweating and screaming for joy ! after enriching conversation and strong coffee , he said he had to go meet someone . when i asked who , he said , ` ` we ' ll talk about it later , it ' s not a big deal . '' he kissed me and i smiled like i have not smiled in years . i smiled so hard that every glass object in my kitchen exploded all at once . a lacerating confetti of joy . an update on the construction of the new redstone abyss . mayor lauren millard reported today that the dig is behind schedule . she sighted a shortage of workers . she had planned for a larger trout of labor , but this simply has not manifested . i ' m disappointed to hear this , desert bluff , but it ' s certainly understandable . we all have jobs and responsibilities , and making time to contribute to the building of this great monument can be difficult . desert bluff is a place of hope , of renewal , of refuge for those in need and above all , of joy . the redstone abyss is a celebration of all those things , and i tell you now that the reward will be great . not just the reward of being devoured by the smiling god , but the reward of your eternal impact on your town . think of the ra pa nui people who built the mo ai , or the proud union workers who erected that de co masterpiece , the chrysler building . or the time traveling street artist collective known as banks , who built stonehenge . every great monument is built by human hands , and those hands leave their artistry for generations to enjoy , discover , and study . the redstone abyss will be a triumph of desert bluff citizens , and later a tourist attraction , and later a historical landmarks , and eventually a curious and misunderstood artefact of a long dead civilization . you can be part of this . mayor millard and i put our heads together and agreed that the solution here is to set up communes and camps along the dig site to make your commuted easier . schools and business es will go on half day schedules so that everyone can make time for the monument . mayor millard , and i support her brilliant idea 100 per cent – believes this is the only task we should be focused on as a town . the smiling god deserves a physical manifestation of our penitence and devotion . desert bluff deserves a notable landmarks , and best of all , if we all worked and lived together , we would get to know each other ' s interests , cultures , languages , histories . if we worked together , we could become so much – closer . and now a word from our sponsors . when we talk apocalypse , we talk fires and spire s of smoke and screams and wars and horrid clouds of ash and floods . and this is a comforting vision , because it supposes we ' re all in it together . but death is mostly something you keep to yourself . in all reality , the apocalypse is likely going to just be you alone in a room with the fly . bed , bath and beyond : you ' re going to need some new sheets . so after my first date with charles , we went out again the following week . i showed him around desert bluff , i took him to the sandy blossom bowl ing alley and arcade joy compound . we bowled that afternoon and played a few old video games like ms parkman , sleepytime spider swallowed , and horse carcass , all the classic from our youth . we then went for a romantic walk along the beach . charles thought it should not be called a beach because there was no body of water , but i pointed out that it was sand , and that there was water somewhere . how close the water is is all a matter of faith . he laughed , and i squeezed his hand . then we went to the food truck park . he bought some cheese rogues from the odessa dumplings truck , while i went to the tex-mex truck and got a burri to filled with fiberglass insulation and re fried beans . the food truck s were not nearly as class as ver million , but food is only as good as the company you enjoy it with . and i really enjoyed my time with charles . it ' s hard to intimately connect to people especially as you get older , but my time with charles made dating seem easy . why would anyone choose to be single when they could just walk up to the perfect man and say ` ` let ' s know each other '' ? when life is good , it ' s hard to understand how it could have ever been bad . after dinner , i suggested we could go get a drink together . unfortunately desert bluff does not have any bars . not for religious reasons , i explained to him . it ' s just that no one ' s been able to open one yet . the state places some pretty high taxes on hard liquor transported across dimension al rifts . so i offered to have him back over to my place for some more wine . but he said he had to be going . i protested . charles said , ` ` kevin . you fill me with such joy , and i do not wan na keep secrets . i should tell you i have a son . his name is donovan and he ' s five . he ' s a sweet kid . '' charles said he moved here because donovan starts school next year , and he wanted to raise his boy in a community based in happiness and positively . but charles is concerned about bringing dates home with him until he knows they will stay around for a while . ` ` kevin , '' he said , touching my face along the socket of my left eye . ` ` i think you would be great around donovan . '' my smile disappeared from my face . not because i did not feel happy , but because i felt – so many things . my lips could not express them all . he said , ` ` i ' m not suggesting we have to be serious right now , we have to figure that out with time . '' he then said we should go back to his place , but on the way , he needed to pick up donovan from grand ma josephine , who has been babysitting . we spent the rest of the evening drinking so das at his home . i wanted to touch charles , to put my hand against his chest again , to kiss him with real passion . but instead we watched donovan play with toy airplane and charles talked about the things parents talk about . donovan was nice , but i had to concentrate hard to keep my smile . an update on the construction of the redstone abyss . nearly everyone in town is now at the dig site , setting into their lean-to ' s and pop tents and gathering up the appropriate tools for the physical labor ahead . mayor lauren millard said she is heartened by the out pouring of support in the past hour . we have made huge strides , already marking out our mile-wide parameter and deepening the pit to almost 1,000 feet . some stone workers have even begun carving sacred texts from the book of devouring . i ' m getting reports from the construction area that some of those things have begun to glow bright white , as the earth trembles beneath them . wo w ! i ' m getting chills just thinking about this ! there have been some scuffles among the workers , miscommunication and arguments that devolved into small fights . the desert bluff police department sent two officers , who are also friends of mine from the temple of joy , ke on and kelton , to break up some of these skirmishes . but more fights and arguments happened than they could control . officers ke on and kelton reported that parties involved in fights were shouting nonsense at each other . they initially thought some were non-english speakers , but they could not identify the languages . then they saw young ran nicholas , who was an english major at ala-bay- , alabama , at his former university , spouting absolute gibberish at another person . ke on and kelton reported that sometimes people ' s words sounded like normal english , but without any context or meaning , and at other times like conventional noise that are not common to any human language . but everyone speaks passionately and personally , thinking they ' re communicating what they mean , even though they were not . apparently the fighting became evasive enough that mayor millard had to make a public address . here ' s a transcribe of what she said . ` ` desert bluff , please do not fight . remember to take time to smile and relate to one another . if someone says something you do not understand or do not appreciate , simply cauliflower . room ba starlight rice tank ship . stallion the blisters right on through , until balloons . '' and then she repeated ` ` until balloons '' over and over , with complete conviction and passion . and eventually the fighting stopped , not because of the speech but because of sheer confusion and exhaustion . as the fighting stopped , so did the construction . no one knew what anyone was saying , longtime friends could not find their words and so resorted to physical gestures . but even jerry kramer and his daughter morgan , who communicate mostly through sign language , found that they could no longer comprehend any of the phrases . more on this developing situation , but first a look at traffic . near the dig site for the redstone abyss , several hay dark shadows , vaguely human-shaped , have begun to appear . they are drifting along city streets , which has caused nearly a dozen minor traffic uh.. a-ci-des . ac-dicent . accidents . there is a ten minute back up entering downtown along sci-fi novel . al-along rhubarb . ugh , i ca not oak tree , ca not sparrow mo dem . sparrow mmodem . sparrowmodem . that ' s not right . i have to compensate . ugh . have to con-den-sate . yellow refrigerator shelves . i ' m trying to say – crab grass to the petroleum ! machine : first unheard message . charles : kevin . sorry to bother you , it ' s charles . i need you to get the word out that language does not work right in desert bluff . i have not found a single dictionary that expresses normal word structure , i ' ve been recording and re-recording this message for the past hour and each time it comes out like alphabet soup . no santa , no identifiable verbs , no words that even appear to fit together . but i did finally manage to find an old text you wrote about the souls of un pure , those whom the smiling god can not clean even upon devour . there ' s a certain style of hat you described that can keep your thoughts and ideas pure . i-i drove over to your house , because i remember you had one just like this you told me you wore during sermons . sorry for going through your stuff , but the hat seems to be working for now . anyway , based on my research , i think this dig is ( looking ) those spirits back into the world and they ' re causing ... there ' s something at my door , kevin . i-i need to go , ok ? call you back in well , i do not know . machine : end of message . charles : there ' s a hay dark shadow covering about my front door , kevin . it ' s not knocking , it ' s just covering in front of my house . i ca not make out a face , i ' m peering through a crack in the living room blinds to get a better look . oh no , i think it saw me ! machine : end of message . charles : ok , it ' s gone i think . this giant yellow hat is really remarkable . anyway , i wanted you to get the word out on your radio show about the dig and let your friend lauren know as well . if we can fully ( stop ) this giant ( pit ) , i think we can stem the return of these un pure souls , who i think are dismantling our language . also ... i have not heard from you in a while . i hope bringing don ny around did not scare you off . if it did , please just tell me now , ok , i wo not be hurt . that ' s a lie . i would definitely be hurt if you stopped seeing me because i have a child , but i wo not be bitter . that ' s really it . i wo not be bitter if you tell me now . now that i think of it , that ' s not true either . i ' ll be less bitter , less hurt , less angry if you tell me now . or maybe you ' re busy . i know the redstone abyss has all your attention these days and what with communication failing us , i ' m sure it ' s hard to think about having dinner or even , i dun no , like a family date . you and me and don ny , maybe a trip to the amusement park or ... we were thinking about adopting a cat , is there an animal shelter in desert bluff ? that could be a really fun day together . either day , when you have a chance , just let me know you got this . i do not wan na stop seeing you , but i d rather know sooner than quiver . quiver . what ? i mean platt er . kevin , that shadow is back . he ' s not at my window anymore , he ' s inside graft huts . no i mean – grant first , grappled wigs grappled wigs , kevin i – handle bar cereal , ok ? handle bar cereal . machine : end of new message . today ' s proverb : girl , did you fall from heaven ? ‘ cause there ' s a giant crater where you landed and radiation levels are spiking .
WTNV|The Mudstone Abyss Part 3|31 October 2018|kevin : if this had been an actual emergency , this signal would be followed by screaming and chaos . welcome to desert bluff . hello , desert bluff ! it has been exactly one week since language resumed function ing . we are all of course relieved to finally be able to greet neighbors once again with a friendly ` ` you should smile more ! '' but sometimes with good news comes bad news . it ' s also been exactly one week since all construction on the redstone abyss was halted . there are still several creeping shadows roaming about the dig site , causing everyone who goes near there to become so overwhelmed with joy that they run away screaming . it ' s unclear why the shadows are still there . we do not know what they want . some have said they want us to dig no further , and that these shadows are responsible for our loss of language . i think they came out to see the beautiful craftsmanship on our redstone abyss . mayor lauren millard called for a halt to construction despite adamant protests from the media . the media spent the past week constantly testing and calling the mayor , telling her construction must continue , because it has been the media ' s dream since childhood to bring a grand physical testament to the smiling god ' s endless happiness and love . but the mayor has been slow to respond . she ' s probably busy schelling contractors to re start work on the monument . maybe the media should try testing the mayor again . why ... is construction ... still ... halted ... lauren ? oh , that sounds a bit aggressive . let ' s brighten that tone a bit with ... oh , bleeding gums emboli ... spider with human eyes emboli , cry-laughing emboli , there we go . the mayor and i have been close for a long time . we ' ve had our up s and down , but i think our more difficult times were back when we used to run a company together . we had some typical disagreements over who was in charge . she thought that because she was the president of the company , she should have final say on all decisions . whereas i knew that i was one of the smiling god ' s chosen prophets , and our all-loving devoured would not choose a prophet who made mistakes . i believe ceasing construction was a mistake . certainly our mayor thinks digging the redstone abyss is somehow connected to our loss of language , and i appreciate her concern , but there is only anecdotal evidence to support this . more on this story as it develops . but first , i wanted to tell you that charles and i went out again ! originally , charles and i were going to go to the opening of the georgia o'keeffe exhibit at the desert bluff museum of art . this exhibit features many of o'keeff ' s famous flower paintings , but re imagined as if o'keeffe were a joyous worship per of the smiling god . artist at the museum have painted large smiles and centipedes over o'keeffe ' s original , and the result is apparently quite powerful and moving . then charles and i planned to have another luxurious dinner at ver million , but at the last minute , grand ma josephine and her demons told him they were not available to baby sit charles ' five-year-old donovan , and we could not find a babysitter . so instead charles , donovan and i spent the day at the desert bluff ' spinning smiles amusement park . we rode the spine compress or , the oesophagus remover , and a brand new roller coster called intentional sepsis . donovan was really delighted by all the struggling actors dressed in stuffy invented animal costumes . don ny got his picture taken with one person dressed as a smiling tortoise . we could hear the man in the costume panting heavily and begging for at er . don ny turned to the tortoise and said : ` ` the sun calls for sacrifice because the sun loves all that it sees . '' the man inside ra sped : ` ` air ! please ! i do not know where i am ! please ! '' and passed out . don ny giggler right as charles took the photo . it was actually really adorable . what a great memory to capture ! we went back to charles ' house and made sandwiched and watched cartoons , but don ny was not interested in the television , he just played with his toy planes , zigging and zagging them over his head , turning and swirling them in reckless fits . i hope he does not grow up to be a pilot . i sat next to charles on the couch , mesmerized by the motion of don ny ' s planes until charles and i fell asleep . around 2 am , i woke up . donovan had put himself into bed and charles was snoring softly against my shoulder . i carefully stood up and pulled charles ' legs onto the sofa . the whole day had made me happy , but not in the way i wanted to be happy about it . happiness should be something you have , not something you take . i placed a blanket over him and drove home . i ' m getting an update that mayor lauren millard is holding a press conference at city hall . let ' s hear her speech live . lauren : people of desert bluff , after discussions with city council as well as some prominent and very knowledgeable members of the media , i have decided to re open construction of the redstone abyss . i know many people are frightened by the shadow beings drifting around the dig site , as well as the ones lurking in and around your homes , but there is nothing to fear . these shadows are merely the impure souls of those devoured and then later ( distorted ) by the smiling god . they ' re not worthy of your fear . these shadows do not even have faces . we can not discern their intentions or feelings . they move around in quick jerks and starts , flickering in and out of our vision , sometimes standing just behind us while slowly tilting their heads . and unless you ' re looking in a mirror , there ' s no way you can even see that . so i ' m not sure why you ' re all freak ing out . plus they are completely intangible . watch ! there ' s one right now , passing in front of me . i ' m whipping my hand back and forth right through it . it ca not do anything , it ' s just a shadow ! it ca not eve smile . construction resume at 7 am sharp on monday . we ' ve assigned every citizen a daily hour time slot with two 10 minute breaks . we ' ve also hired some clowns to come by to keep everyone smiling . as a former corporate president , i know first hand how important laughter is for maintaining a healthy work environment . skeleton silverfish ! what , u h ? silverfish french press carbuncle . i ca not pillowcase slapstick ? uuh , plenty of hibiscus ! yeah . kevin : ah , mayor millard ! such a way with words . well you heard her , it ' s a joyous day . in fact , probably a future holiday . i can not wait to start digging again next week , desert bluff ! let ' s look now at the community calendar . these are probably the last non-construction events we ' ll have for a couple of weeks . on wednesday afternoon at morning bird records , the society for painless lving will b holding a protest march against the construction of the redstone abyss . well , i do not usually read press re leases for such tiny events , but i guess there might be one or two people who want to exercise their right to assembly . so if this sounds like something you ' re interested in , i guess you should go to the march , and then think about all the joy the smiling god has give you and question your motives for refusing to appreciate it . thursday morning , the citizens of free will will host a sit-in at the sunlite allay din er to demonstrate their opposition to the mayor ' s order for mandatory labor on the redstone abyss . huh . oh this looks netter ! thursday afternoon , the natural smiles theatre company i love that name ! – is opening their new play , ` ` the pit of ruin '' . playwright danika lope says her work is an ( – ) par able about the arrogance of religion , government and media . lope ' play , according to their press material , tells a story of a bloviating radio host who overreaches his position , enslaving an entire town in order to feed his hunger for religious power . i like the sound of this theatre company less and less . there has to be some community event that ' s actually fun in here . friday morning , the people for clean sharp teeth will be burning kevin the radio host in effigy . i do not ... understand . i d like to spend more time on this . explaining to you , dear listeners , that my happiness is not yours to take . i d like to have all afternoon to teach you about how you must receive your own joy by making joy , rather than destroying others ' joy . but i can not spend any time on this , because i ' m getting word that mayor millard is being forcibly removed from her podium at city hall ! a large crowd of unsmiling people overtook the mayor and the city council . the crowd used a tattoo gun to draw a permanent frown on the mayor ' s face , which effectively exiles her from this community . the crowd is chanting : ` ` pe te ma ' s handlebars , pe te ma ' s handlebars ! '' the police have tried using their bull horns to call for order , but instead of words they ' re emitting bird chips . language seems to be failing us again . desert bluff , i need you to remain calm . i need you to take a deep breath and think positive thoughts . think about the smiling god , its mammoth wriggling form and thousands of legs emerging from the earth and devouring your body . en vision your whole self nest led in the moist , loving belly of the divine beast . smile while you do it , desert bluff . keep smiling . keep – i ' m getting a phone call . oh , it ' s from charles ! maybe he found a babysitter . hey charles , i was just thinking about you . you know there ' s a night club that opened last month ? it ' s called no exit . i thought maybe we could drop off don ny with josephine this evening and then ... u h huh . so you called to see if i wanted to go to the z oo with you and don ny this afternoon instead ? uh.. well , i was just looking at the weather and i ' m not sure if today ' s the day to ... it ' s not . charles . i have the weather report right here . listen . i figured it out , desert bluff . the mob outside city hall has dispersed . they returned lauren millard with her tattooed frown to her position as mayor , but city by laws prohibit anyone incapable of smiling from serving in that position . so for now , we have no mayor . the drifting shadows around the redstone abyss have dissipated , returning whatever other otherworld they came from , and the construction has begun again at the monument dig site , several days ahead of schedule . i figured it out . during our phone call , charles was getting flustered . i asked what was wrong and he said donovan was distracting him by swinging his toy planes around again . i told charles to focus on us and not worry about what donovan was doing . ` ` we ca not talk about us , kevin , without worrying about what donovan is doing , '' he snapped at me . ` ` donovan is us . that ' s the deal , ok ? '' and i was hurt . i was not smiling . i do not like criticism , it makes me sad , and then mad , and then – confused . listeners , i do not often use strong language , so if your ears are sensitive to vulgarity , turn the volume down for a few seconds . i hate ! not being happy . i hate it ! there , i said it . i ' m sorry . i thought about what charles said . i thought about his teeth , his chest , his hair , his snoring , his smile . i thought about donovan . i thought about donovan swinging those toy planes around above his head , like the birds in that dream every one of us has every single night . you know , where the birds zig and zag across a blood red sky , recklessly turning and swirling in panicked fits . donovan ' s planes were , in fact , moving in the exact same pattern as those birds . i figured it out . each movement , each turn , each path of each plane was identical to those birds ' paths . listeners , it ' s not a dream . it ' s a message . the shadows do not speak in our mouth languages , but in shapes and patterns . i interrupted charles to tell him this . i told him to take don ny to the redstone abyss . i told him to bring don ny ' s planes . charles and don ny approached the shadowy figures . the gathered crowd called to them to stop , to move no closer to the shadows , but all the crowd could yell was ` ` cabbage coat hangers ! '' charles then presented don ny to the shadows , and they flicked as he rigged and zagged his planes above his head . and then – a miracle happened . glowing dotted lines appeared in the paths of the toy planes . a radiant geometry , triangles and stars and hexagons . the shapes began to connect to each other , circles forming spheres , triangles forming pyramids . the shadows raised their arms and disappeared . don ny stopped flying his planes around , but the dotted lines hung in mid air , an un readable but completely comprehensible message to the now silent crowd . they figured it out . one by one , the people returned to the dig site and began carving the shapes they had just seen into the redstone . as people grew tired and stepped away for rest breaks , they found that their words had returned to them . and when they went back to digging more , they fell silent again , but only because they felt more comfort in their new spatial language of shapes and motion . the anger over the construction was no more . citizens came together , not just out of a common communication , nor for the good of a great monument , but because happiness finally showed itself to them , and they discovered their own paths to peace . through the pride of choosing the hard work , for the benefit of all . charles called to tell me how excited he was for me . ` ` you figured it out , '' he said . ` ` kevin , you figured it out . '' i told him : ` ` don ny figured it out . he did not spout a solution in words , but in deeds . you should be proud of your son , charles , i said . i am proud of him . '' i did not say anything else . i need more time to know what else to say . soon , we ' ll go visit the z oo . hopefully soon we ' ll have a night to ourselves . to drink , to dine , to dance , and late at night in a quiet home , to dream a dream of diving birds , of lo e and language . and we will wake up the same people in a different place . the earth will have moved , the clocks will have moved , the sun will not have moved . but we will wake and we will smile , and we will do our best to understand ourselves and others . desert bluff , i did not figure out the language of the abyss , don ny did . i did not figure out what the language intended , you did . what i figured out was that i sometimes push too hard . i will do my best to not do that . we are building this monument because you want to . i want to too , but i ' m glad you found your own way here . lauren , tattooed frown scrawled crooked on her face , is standing over the pit and staring at the shapes the dream has shown us , as though reading messages only she could understand . she is muttering strange syllables to herself and staring at obvious malice at the workers in the pit . so even she has found a hobby in this – post-mayoral life . thank you , desert bluff . i love this town . i ' m happy you do too . stay tuned next for the sound a child makes upon seeing a griffe in real life . and as always , until next time , desert bluff , until next time . today ' s proverb : kangaroos are deer abbreviated .
WTNV|Harvest Time|14 November 2018|everything old will be new again , except for when it ' s so old it disintegrates at your touch and scatters into oblivion . welcome to night vale . it ' s harvest time . a time of reaping , sowing , and rebirth . a time of turning over old soil and doing something with crops , maybe . no one really knows . all we know is that every night for the past week , we ' ve heard the air raid sir en blasting in the town square and a ( - ) voice chanting : ` ` behold ! despair ! rejoice ! harvest time approaches ! '' there has never been a harvest time before , so it should prove to be an exciting event . or phenomenon . or period of forced manual labor . no one currently has any guesses as to what exactly will be harvested . since the land surrounding night vale is barren sand wastes , as noted on the new tourism billboard out on route 800 , which reads : ` ` now entering night vale . if you lived here , you d be dead by now . '' john peters – you know , the farmer – remarked with pride that he ' s never encountered a single visible crop in all his years of farming . and then remarked with suspicion that he does not believe in routes , and if anyone tries to tell you different they ' re a filthy liar . he then opened a tobacco tin , pulled a wad of feathers from inside and ate them . a big congratulations to former night vale community radio inter maureen , who has just received her heating , ventilator , and air condition ing or hvac certification . it ' s apparently one of the only fortifications one can receive from the community college that does not require internship credits . she is not sure if she ' s passionate about the ventilator sciences yes , but it at least makes for a lucrative side hussle . especially in this current heat wave . according to our friends at the unavoidable casualties bureau , the current heat wave will statistical take eight lives by morning . who will they be ? i do not have the answers , of course , and there certainly is not a betting pool laying 7-to-1 odds on susan tillman or anything like that , but that ' s a fun thought experiment , right ? former inter maureen has also expressed the need for an income boost , so she can help her girlfriend michelle ' s store , dark owl records , out of financial difficulties . dark owl records has been on hard times since they took a stance against free market capitalism by ceasing use of actual currency . we have here a testimonials from one of maureen ' s satisfied customers . gladys r. from old town says : ` ` our air conditioned was making a terrible sound , and maureen came in and installed new insulation and cooling pipes and even fixed the motor . it works great now . the insulation she used was made of premium wolf spider eggs , which she explained are particularly energy efficient , since they are made to withstand the extreme desert heat and keep all those tiny wolf spider embryos nice and cool . millions of matured wolf spiders did begin pouring out of every vent in our house after a few weeks , but the air quality remained crisp and cool . an exterminator came in and sprayed for the spiders , which totally killed them , so that ' s not an issue anymore . but the poison that was used to kill that particular species did cause small benign tumours to form along my underarms , as well as my husband ' s . and the tumours began pulsating , and the doctors later discovered heartbeats inside the tumours , but they did stress the fact that these tumours are totally benign . the doctors advised a wait and see approach and put my husband and i on a course of pre natal vitamin . unfortunately , the vitamin gave both of us a rash , which is slightly itchy , so we stopped taking them . there ' s no specialist in town to help us with this , and no ointment or home remedy that seems to work , that ' s a little frustration , but the air is still very crisp and cool , and the unit does not make that terrible sound anymore . thanks maureen , five stars ! would suffer sentiment tumours again . '' wo w , what a nice review from gladys . personally , i love it when it ' s this hot out . it feels like everything is just moments away from catching fire . it ' s exhilarating . now the community calendar . let ' s see . u m ... it ' s all just notations in a childlike scrawl about how harvest time is coming . oh wait , here ' s something else . u h , there ' s a spaghetti feed tonight at the elks lodge . if you ' ve never been to the spaghetti feed before , you ' re really missing out . it ' s all about folks in the community coming together and eating and eating and not knowing when it ' s over , because the spaghetti just keeps coming . it ' s about commitment and dedication . it ' s about not being a quitter . remember when they called you a quitter growing up ? ` ` quitter , '' they said , pointing at you and your half eaten sack of pa sta . do not you wan na prove them wrong ? keep feeding ! feeding is not about nourishment , not anymore . it ' s about quantity , mass , volume , and proving you ' re no quitter . it ' s about commitment ! tonight at the elks lodge . this has been the community calendar . and now , traffic . when you were 12 years old , you sat in the passenger seat waiting for your mother to come out of the clothing store called don ' s that used to be on main street . you turned the ignition to the battery-only setting so you could listen to the radio . you were reading a fiction al tabloid newspaper and eating candy . the window was halfway down . a crisp breeze ruffled the newsprint in your hands . you were perfectly content , a feeling you wo not experience again until well into your 30 ' s . the car that was park ed next you began to back away . you saw it from the corner of your eye , and you were overcome with the panic vestige sensation that your own car was moving forward , that it was picking up speed and rolling right into the don ' s , through the display window , through the mannequins and wrangled jeans that hung loosely around their plastic hips , and oh god your mother ! she would be mangled among heaps of bloody denis and plastic body parts , and it would all be your fault somehow . yes , you probably turned the ignition too far and somehow put the car into gear . you were only trying to listen to the radio . your hands slammed onto the glove compartment , and you waited for the deafening impact of plate glass , and you squeezed your eyes shut . this has been traffic . did it just get dark out suddenly ? no . wait . there ' s something covering the windows of the studio . what is that ? it looks like someone has plastered flyers all over the building . wait , let me pe el one of these off . ok . plastered all over other nearby buildings as well . they say ` ` harvest time is nigh . all will be cleansed . '' huh . i just got a text alert saying the same thing . did you guy s get that ? wait , is that smoke outside ? hang on a second . yes . u m , the night vale fire department is assuring me now that the air is filled with black acrid smoke , but there ' s no fire to account for its origins . so the fire department says it ' s not actually smoke , it ' s perfectly normal dark air . breathe deeply , go for a jog , let the little ones run free in the park , fire chief among incarnacian announced from insider her air tight bunker . ` ` the dark air is coming from all directions at once , '' incarnacian explained . ` ` so there ' s no point in avoiding any particular areas . just go about your business , folks . visibility is covering right around zero , so please stick to the posted speed limits when driving . you will not be able to see the posted speed limits , so just try to remember what they are . we ' re on the honor system here , ok ? '' the fire department recommends trying memory games to help sharpen your skill , like ` ` look look '' or ` ` fruit f lip '' , or get yourself a simon . you guy s should remember simon , the toy that flashed different colors in a certain order , and you ' re supposed to correctly mimi their patterns . if you do it right , they tell you a secret . sometimes it ' s a secret about someone else , maybe a stranger . maybe someone you know . probably your girlfriend . it ' s a secret about you , something she would never tell you , and certainly something you do not want to know . the only way to make sure that secrets stay safe is to get the pattern right . blue blue red green , blue yellow , other , ( - ) , cornflower , chartreuse , chartreuse , ecruu ... it helps to sing it . ` ` remember if you fail at this or anything , '' incarnacian added , ` ` it ' s because you did not try hard enough . everything is a pure meritocracy . '' speaking of remembering , my niece janice has been practically knocking herself out studying for the pre-sat ' s . i know a lot of other kid s at night vale high school are doing the same right now , so we ' re going to run through a few practice questions to help them prepare . first , basic analogies . scavenger is to carrion as love is to a ) car accident , b ) quitting your job , c ) cooking for friends , or d ) cooking friends . wait , ( that was ) the answers for the verbal section , um.. here , let ' s try ma th . how much would you have to be paid to pull out your own fingernails ? the correct answer is 450 dollars . how much would you have to be paid to pull out your own fingernail sin the year 1979 ? the correct is 1,520 dollars , adjusting for inflation . how many box turtle would it take to eat a common raven ? mmm . think about that while we go to the weather . breaking news . a giant statue has been erected in the town squire . a post-minimalist anthropoid the size of a suburban rent style house . it ' s made of italian marble with wasteful touches of bronze , but also concrete , scraps of paper , chicken feet , and plastic ( cub ) caps from a 1979 nissan ultima for eyes . scratched into the dirt around the statue are the words : ` ` harvest time is now '' . theories vary on what this means , but seem largely to fall in three categories . religious leaders believe harvest time may finally signify the onset of end of times , which they ca not deny will give them a certain s mug satisfaction . there have been more than a few human sacrifices so far , which some are saying is a bit presumptive , but as john f. penned famous said , ` ` sacrifices go n na sacrifice '' . others are claiming this is all a vital marketing campaign for a new began restaurant . a voice was heard echoing the smoke-filled streets . ` ` it ' s a chain , is not it ? i ' ve eaten at one . it ' s a buffets thing , '' the voices shouted . ` ` the restaurant is inside a statue . '' others still prepared a public demonstration by standing around holding blank signs , knowing they will feel strongly about something soon . hm . u h , looking at the community calendar , i no longer see the rotation for harvest time . the elks lodge spaghetti feed is still happening though . not too late to get down there and grab a plate . i know that ' s where i ' m headed right after this broadcast . i ' m getting a report from the spaghetti feed that those in attendance felt painfully full only moments ago , or ` ` abysmal with spaghetti '' , as one feed er put it , and now fall somewhere in the spectrum between ravenous hungry and the absence of any sensation at all . sounds delicious ! ok , alright , i am getting quite a lot of reports all at once . u m , . it appears some things have gone missing . citizen jeremy godfrey , who has been experiencing symptoms of midwife crisis for several months , reported a sudden and complete loss of the fear of death . my brother-in-law , steve carlsberg , reported his christmas decorations are missing from his attic . now this includes the life-size santa that sits in an aluminium boat and casts a fishing pole string made of lights . my niece janice expressed the dissenting opinion that the loss of these decorations may actually be a gain for the family . janice also reported her p sat practice test went completely blank , after she spent hours filling it out . fortunately she enjoys standardized tests , so she just did it again . professor harrison kip is missing two toes . though luckily , they were his two extra . siobhan asdaq has reported the loss of a close acquaintance after inadvertently hurting their feelings online , but noted maybe it ' s better this way , if they ' re going to be such a crybaby about little things like all caps curse-filled insults . little league coach betty lucero reported all of her baseball bat s are missing . she found her garage filled instead with fruit bat s , which are at the time of this report drowsily eating banana . ah , also . everyone in town reported their credit card numbers stolen and max ed out . hm m . the charges on the cards originated from the same places : a building supply company , a scrap yard , and a michael ' s craft store next to the staples . it appears all the stolen funds have gone to building the new statue in the town square . now there are mixed feelings about this , as it is a beautiful statue but you know , it ' s also credit fraud . and i have here and addendum to the testimonials i read earlier from former inter maureen ' s air condition ing client , gladys r. it reads : ` ` the skin hangs loosely from our arms , where tumours once bulged with un knowing life . they hang flat and empty , with tiny open sores . perhaps where something emerged in the night while we slept . we slept so well . i ca not emphasize that enough . the rhythmic sensations of those little heartbeats vibrating against the fat and bones of our arms lull ed us into a state of complete relaxation . a relaxation deeper than we have ever known before . we miss that . we really miss that . wee ca not sleep anymore . we did not fully appreciate what we had until it was gone . we acknowledge that and we repent . we want to find whatever it was that was inside of us and put it back . we do not know what to look for or where to begin . if anyone has seen anything , please let us know . '' thanks , gladys r. ! will do . wait , are you guy s hearing that ? there ' s a new sound coming from the town square , tit sounds like the trumpet ing of ram ' s horns . and the smoke has started clearing up , and now there remains only a gray dusty quiet . is it over ? did anything really happen ? so many things are like that , are not they ? anticipation and disappointment . loss and abundance happening at the same moment . so that you end up with only the uneasy illusion of balance or meaning . i ' m hearing now that there ' s an engraved placed on the anthropoid statue , previously unseen because it was stopped over with plaster and looked hastily scratched into the back of a license plate with a nail . it says , ` ` ripeness is perfection , and perfection is the step before decay . '' www , that ' s sweet , right ? anyway , better get down to the spaghetti feed before it ' s over . oh , and the answer is 2 . 2 box turtle can completely devour a common raven . stay tuned for the original 1972 folk rock ad jingle for the simon memory game entitled ` ` never forget to remember – and remember to forget to forget '' . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : if you circle the letters in the bible just right , you get the phrase : ` ` lightly dressed ka le '' . so i do not know what that means , but it ' s direct from god .
WTNV|The Birthday of Lee Marvin|30 November 2018|to err is human . to forgive is also human . the possibilities of human action are a multitude . welcome to night vale . today is a very special day , listeners . yes , for once your calendars are not deceiving you . today is the 30 th birthday of longtime night vale resident and hollywood legend , lee margin . mr . margin is on break from the film ing of ` ` the rise of the hobbies , part 4 , '' the anticipated next chapter of peter jackson ' s part film series , based on the copyright page of ` ` the hobbit '' . the town has declared the birthday a civic holiday , and are holding a fair in honor of mr . margin in grove park . the man himself is said to speak later today , but head over now to play fun carnival games and eat local snacks . john peters – you know , the farmer – will be there selling boiled imaginary corn dipped in theoretical butter . a ta sty and extremely healthy snack , containing practically no calorie at all . more on these birthday celebrations , as there continues to be a birthday to celebrate . ah , i ' m just so excited ! i ' m sorry , i really get into birthdays , always have . i just , i wish i could remember when mine is . but first , some important facts about the moon from local moon scientist , or moon-ologist , ross sutherland . the moon is a weak egg , set to crack at a glance . the moon is a maniac al scent sniffed out by tidal waters . the moon is a barbarous necklace upon the neck of our barbarous world . the moon is a ( ritzy ) cloak , too gauzy for day wear . the moon is an accidental height , one that may some day be catastrophically adjusted . thank you , ross , for those fascinating facts . the birthday celebration is in full swing . this is a town that loves our local legends , and no one is more local or legendary than movie star lee margin . and not only a movie star , he has also been doing work in the theatre . just this year , he st aged a one-man version of ` ` angels in america '' at the community theater , playing every single character over seven and a half hours , except the angels . angels have a strong union and it turns out that no one is allowed to play an angel , unless they are himself an angel . the angels who participated in the production also found the play offensive , saying that it stereotyped angels as flying beings shouting prophesied and wresting with divinely chosen humans . ` ` yes , '' said an angel who once was the town ' s richest man . ` ` i have shouted a prophecy or two in my life , and yes , i wrestled a human over a divine message . but that ' s a tiny part of my lived experience , and i want this work to better represent my whole being . '' as such , the play was practically rewritten and was mostly about angels attending school board meetings , throwing dinner parties , and hanging out at the parking lot of the ralphs . i was deeply moved . anyway , come on down to grove park . you do not wan na miss this birthday party . the angels brought sheet cake . and now a public service announcement . trish hide and simone rigid eau are seeking volunteers for their new community service organization that puts cut e paper hats on dogs . ` ` sure , '' said trish hide from within her darkened house , speaking through a narrow gap she had pulled in her blinds . ` ` dogs are cut e , but have you ever seen a dog in a paper pirate ? or , or , or a chef ' s hat ? wha-wha-what about a paper the shaped like another dog , perched on top of the first dog ' s head . it is these kinds of experiences we wish to bring to the world with our new organization . what was that ? ! '' she finished , suddenly snapping the blinds shut and disappearing . there was a series of loud thus and a slow dragging sound from inside , and then the whites of her eyes against the blinds again as she hissed : ` ` did you see that ? what did you see ? you saw it , did not you ? '' until your friendly reporter decided it would be best to back away from your house and then , having reached the sidewalk , turn and run , his breath rattling in and out of his chest . simone rigid eau only commented that she is happy to devote her time to such a good cause . and that also , the world ended a long time ago . ` ` this is not the world , '' she said . ` ` i do not know what this is , but i know dogs are in it and so that ' s what i ' ll focus on . '' anyone wishing to sing up with the organization should just tell the next dog you see , and they ' ll take care of the rest . and now , traffic . a scattering of roads in the desert , far from human habitation . these roads are only roads in the most theoretical of senses . they are merely packed down dirt , cleared of plants , and no vehicle has passed over them in years . is a road that is never used still a road ? or is it something else ? a marking , a monument to movement that never came to be ? one of these not-roads meanders its way over a rise and back down through chapallar . from high up in a plane or sitting in the clean white interior of a flying saucer , it would appear as though someone had taken a pen and let it trail loosely over the earth . eventually , it meets up with another scattering of dirt roads . these have a few farms and business es along them , not many but these roads are sometimes used . maybe the people here are aware that one of their roads drift off far into the desert , ending at an abandoned cross-hatching of lanes . but more likely , they only know that one of their roads goes nowhere , and they ignore that road . from this barely populated area , one of the dirt roads heads out , becomes paved , goes its two-laned way into a small town with a high school and a palmar . this small town has a road that ends at the highway . the highway merges eventually onto the interstate , an lane river of cars pouring into and out of the city , a vast pool of life . some of that life is only there for the day . others will live and die never having left their neighborhoods . and you could , if you wanted , get in your car in the heart of this metropolis and take the interstate to the highway , to the two-lane road , through the small town , to the scarcely populated dirt roads , and follow that one meandering road over the rise and come to an intersect ion of markings that are only roads in the most theoretical of ways . and you could get out of your car and walk along these roads , the first human to touch them since their creation , and perhaps even then , but no one ever has , and no one ever will . this has been traffic . the party is still rolling along down in grove park . martin mccaffrey , local representative of the t sa , has set up an art sale with some of his works , all of which contain strange dark hunched figures . it seems wildly inappropriate that he has chosen to set up a private art sale at a public birthday party for someone else , but you go martin , i guess . oh , oh ! the crowd is buzzing ! lee margin has arrived . everyone stop buzzing , i ' m trying to hear what lee is saying ! he must be so happy about celebration . u h he ' s approaching the mi c , it appears he has prepared a speech to thank us for this party . ah , that ' s wonderful . we will return with that speech in just a moment , but first , we absolutely must check in on the weather . lee margin : hello . thank you for coming to my birthday party . it has been my 30 th birthday for a long time . hundreds of years , maybe thousands of years . continuously my 30 th birthday . i never grow a day older . i do not know why this of all the days that are my birthday is the one on which you chose to throw a party , but it ' s sure nice of you to think of me . that cake looks fine . how is a person supposed to track time outside of the context of the world ? if it was my 30 th birthday when george washington declared himself god-king of america , and it was my 30 th birthday when stanley brick st aged the moon landing . and my 30 th birthday today , then how old am i ? how much time has passed ? it is impossible for me to have a sense of time , i ' m not on a ship sailing to some great destination , i am floating on my back in the sea of time staring up at cruel and alien stars . the currents take me . i will never wash up on any golden shore . perhaps i will someday sink . without the context of history , my memories are flat , each holding equal weight . each with the possibility of having taken place the same amount of time ago . i remember standing on this land , when no one else was here . even the land was not quite here yet . it was still part of a larger land mass that would shiver out all over the earth , holding in the contour of its coast lines the memory of its schism . the air was heavy and warm and breathing felt like drinking . it was my 30 th birthday that day . i sat under a few branches to protect myself from the rain . this was thick forest then , the sea lapped up against it and all of this , all of that , has dried up . it hardly ever rains . on my 30 th birthday , i stood with the town elders as they declared the formation of this community . i signed on the original charter . go see for yourself in the civic history museum , in the lobby of city hall , admission is free . and anyone with a secret or top secret clearance with any major government agency is welcome to take a look . there you will see that tattered bit of paper and on it , among the scrawl of men whose names have decay ed along with their bones is a signature that remains as clean and clear as the day i wrote it . it says ` ` lee margin '' , and in parentheses it says ` ` 30 '' , with several exclamation points . perhaps we were wrong to create this town . even in the moment of signing , we were avoiding each other ' s eyes , there was much we did not understand about this place that we were naming and giving boundaries to , but we felt in debt to something much larger than us . and the town of night vale was one of its demands . later , on my 30 th birthday , i watched missiles streak across the sky and knew we were all doomed . and then we were not doomed , and it was still my 30 th birthday . i do not know what happened . i only know what it smelled like . there was a smell like cloves on the wind , and a smell like plastic wrap that has gotten warm in the sun . and a smell like an elevator just after it ' s been cleaned . i stood outside and i took great whiffs of air , understanding that by all rights i should not have been able to do that anymore . in that moment , i should not have existed . but i did . and so i breathed and breathed . maybe it had smelled like that before outside , maybe it always had and i just never truly noticed until that moment . i love night vale . but i ' m afraid of night vale . i-i think many of us feel that way , although we do not speak of it . we announce our love of civic leadership and of our town pride but – sometimes we find that we are standing in front of a shed in our garden , and the door is cracked open a little and in that darkness of the shed there is a depth of terror so great that no one world could contain it . and we stand barefoot in grass made sharp by drought and we gape at the shadows within the shed , without knowing what we are seeing and by the time we realize what we are doing , the sun has long gone down and the stars have infested the sky and we are still standing in front of that garden shed with the door ajar . or , well , maybe that ' s just me . certainly that has happened to me on , on many of my 30 th birthdays , but no more . i seek for my unchanging life to change . i seek context , i seek one moment in which i understand what time it is . thank you for coming to my birthday . well , i do not believe it ' ll be my birthday much longer . looks like the cake is all gone now . cecil : wwwwwwwwwhatt is there to say about someone on the date of their birth iiii.. i suppose , u h the same things to say about them on any other day although – too often we do not . he is ... a kind man . uhhh , a good friend . he helps sometimes , and thinks about helping often . he tries . it does not always work , but he tries , or he does not . but he thinks about trying . he is , in other words , like any of us , and today is his birthday , and so for today we say about him the warm things that we perhaps should be saying about each other all of the time . why wait for a single day to say a kind word ?

WTNV|A Blood Stone Carol|14 November 2018|it ' s winter and the weather ' s freezing , quite appalling . you stay in , aloof . but footsteps , yes , there ' s someone creeping , crying , calling . a stranger up upon on your roof . welcome to night vale . it ' s the holidays , listeners , when the majority of this country celebrate how their experience of this season is defined as the default universal experience . while every other cultural group ' s experience is expected to be in reaction and comparison not the majority ' s experiences . and if a person does not wish to live in reaction to this default experience of the season , they are seen as hostile or ( beliterant ) merely for their wish to not participate in what is , after all , a celebration of the era sure of their culture under the dominant violence of another ' s . all to say , happy blood stone day to those who celebrate it ! now last year , your air waves were unfortunately taken over by a horrible pirate podcast , telling a story that was quite unfit for any listener ' s ears . so i d like to re mediate that by telling a story of my own . a night vale holiday classic , one i ' m sure all of you know . but is not there pleasure in hearing once again the story you can recite every word of ? it is like visiting a friend . night vale community radio presents to you , dear listener , a blood stone carol . our story begins on the evening of blood stone day eve . a mr . scrooge was being quite horrid to his employees : under paying them , shouting , some light flaying , et cet era . his employees bowled their displeasure . ` ` take it up with h r , '' said scrooge . this was his way of a jokes a h r had been cats into a pit several days before because they suggested perhaps there could be slightly less flaying in the office . scrooge valued three things . one , himself . two , his money . three , nothing else . he went home from the office quite content with the way he had spent his day . he had made a good deal of money and a good deal of misery , and both seemed fair and right to him . his bed was made by a housekeeper he d never met , who came while he was at work , and set everything in his home so it looked like no one had ever lived there . signs of life bother ed scrooge . so i guess it was good news that the person sitting at his kitchen table was dead . mr . marley , a business partner of scrooge ' s who had died some time before . and he looked it . his skin peeled and bubble d , where there was skin left . the smell was tremendous . ` ` my god , '' scrooge said , ` ` what is this ? '' marley turned toward him as best he could , for he was wrapped in heavy chains . and he said , as best he could , for his tongue was mostly missing : ` ` you will be visited by three spirits . '' ` ` i ' ll be visited by what ? '' marley muttered ` ` three spirits '' again and then fell heavily to the floor , and rolled out of the kitchen awkwardly in his heavy chains . the smell lingered , and scrooge felt ill . ` ` well this wo not do , '' scrooge said . ` ` i ' m going right to bed and forgetting all of this . '' and so he did go right to bed . but hardly had closed his eyes , when he heard a noise . a guttural slurring sound like someone inhaling paste . scrooge sat up and looked about the room , but it was as empty and dark and clean as before . ` ` is someone there ? '' he shouted , knowing that the answer was no , and also that the answer was yes . there was no one there , but no one was there . stubborn , he closed his eyes and tried to send himself ( determitedly ) to sleep . but no sooner did he try that he heard a whifling sound quite near his ear , like loose lips flapping . his eyes snapped open . the room was still empty . ` ` are you the first of these spirits ? '' scrooge shouted . ` ` well , then show yourself ! '' and again , nothing . but a nothing that held weight . a nothing that was very much something in itself . this time , scrooge decided he would not try to go to sleep . he would sit up in bed and wait out this so-called spirit . if anything occurred , his eyes would be open to see it . then , he blinked . when his eyes opened again a micro second later , there was a face inches from his face . the face was too close to perceive any details except a sense of – clammy paleness , of eyes that were wide but with no pupils , of a mouth that drooped sideways . scrooge yelped and scrambled backward along the bed , but it was no good . the face stayed with him , still being exact same distance , nearly pressed up against his own . the face hooted at him , a bad joke of a voice , but scrooge did not find it funny . he got out of bed , tried to escape , but the face was with him the entire time . no matter where he turned , no matter where he went , this howling hairless face hung in front of his own . ` ` what are you , spirit ? '' he cried . ` ` what have you come to teach me ? '' but this was the ghost of blood stone day past , and like the past , it was incapable , but had no point , no lesson to impart . it merely was . the ghost moaned , and he felt cold saliva spreading over him . the face came even closer , until their noses touched , and the face ' s nose came apart like wet paper macheve . ` ` go away , go away , go away ! '' scrooge cried . and it did go away , as quickly as it had come , the ghost had left . scrooge had gained nothing from the encounter . in fact , much had been taken from him . scrooge was speechless and breathless . and if he had breath and if he had speech , what could he say ? there were no words for what he had seen . he went and made himself some tea , but could not find a way to swallow it . he kept feeling the nose dissolve against his nose like marshy soil , like our memories as we age . three spirits , marley had said . how was he to face two more of them ? he went warily to his bed , waiting at any moment for a ghastly visage to swim toward him out of the shadows . but nothing came . he sat on the bed , still nothing . he got in bed , nothing . he closed his eyes and opened his eyes , nothing had come to his room . instead , he was no longer in his room . he got up bewildered . his bed was now in a forest , dense enough that it was impossible to see more than a hundred feet in any direction , but spare enough that it was well lit , although he could not see any sun in the sky . there was some detail about this place , other than his abrupt appearance in it , that was setting him on edge . he spun around , waiting for a devil to pounce on him from the under brush , but it was silent . hold on . it was silent , absolutely so . that was what was making him nervous . there was no rustle of the trees , no call of birds . he had never felt so alone . and it was , as he thought this , that he saw in the distance a figure . the figure was tall and gray and shaped like a human , mostly . it had a wide mouth and it was screaming . scrooge could not hear it . he wanted no part of whatever this figure represented and turned to run . but when he turned , the figure was there too , absolutely still , absolutely silent . and screaming in mortal terror . scrooge did not know how he knew it was terror , only that he knew . fear was thick in the air . he could taste it on his tongue . this figure was terrified and it was still and it was silent . scrooge set his back straight and remembered who he was , an important business man after all , a powerful man that caused other men to with er and quaker . so he walked toward the figure . but he was not able to approach it . no matter how far he went into the forest , the figure remained in the distance . its limbs were played , it was dozens of feet tall , its mouth was wide , it was screaming and there was no sound at all . finally , scrooge could not take it . he screamed back , and that ' s when he found he could make no sound either . there they were , the figure and him . they were both terrified , and neither of them could make even the smallest squeaky , even the tiniest whisper of fear . without release , the fear had nowhere to go , and it growled scrooge ' s rib cage , a wild animal seething in captivity . if he could , scrooge would have torn it out of his chest , but he could not . he could only stand there and face the figure of the ghost of blood stone day present . both of them could scream silently . after hours of this , perhaps even days , he found he was back in his bedroom . yet no time had passed at all . scrooge wept . he was envious of the ghosts whose job it was to haunt . he no longer wanted to be himself , whose job it was to be haunted . he muttered as he wept , a matter of envy . ` ` i wish i were dead , oh , i wish i were dead . '' from outside , the sound of the weather seemed to echo his words . scrooge lay in his bed , shivering , waiting for the visit from the third spirit . given what he had experienced so far , he had to believe that the spirits had saved the most terrible for last , and he could not imagine what hideous phantom would gather itself in the darkness . he kept his eyes closed and awaited cold breath on his ear , or a dry finger caressing his cheek , but nothing came . the tension was enormous and he felt his stomach tighten . in fact , he became quite caseous . he put his hand on his stomach , an instinctual gesture to calm his own body , and one that was utterly futile . it was as though his abdomen were an altar and his placating hand an offering placed by a condemned man . the offering would not be accepted . the man would remain condemned . scrooge felt within his abdomen – a movement , and realized he was feeling the clenching of his intestines seized by the terrible feeling within him . they tightened and released , tightened and released , and he could feel the strange twitching of them . he became aware all at once that this coiled creature lived within him and could at any time turn against him . this awareness , and h t dread still hanging over him about the approaching spirit , brought with it a wave of panic . with the panic came dizziness . now his stomach lurched and his intestines clenched and his head swam . he did not feel in control of any part of himself . how could it be this awful ? and the ghost was yet to even appear to him . scrooge stumbled up out of bed and moved blandly through the malevolent darkness to the bathroom . he kneel ed before the toilet , a pitiful suppliant , but nothing came . relief would not be so easy as a purge . this feeling ( waltz ed ) in him , it took him , and he was not in control of his body . his feet felt numb . had his feet felt numb this entire time or was this a new symptom ? he stumbled up and to the mirror and saw himself , and here was the final horror for him . he looked no different . the same face , the same flesh , the same hair . his eyes were his eyes , only with the light of panic in them . and in that moment , he knew , and in knowing , he despaired . there was no third spirit coming for him , there was only the failure and strangeness of his own body . this , truly , was the ghost of blood stone day yet to come . for as the years passed , his body would drift farther and father from his own conception of it . he would rebel and he would suffer strange torments that would alter his life , and the doctors would furrow their brow and be unable to diagnose anything , because the symptoms were too diffused . ` ` you ' re just getting older , '' the doctors would say to him , and he would scream : ` ` but this is not my body , i want my body back ! '' but it was his body , and like all bodies , it would not remain loyal . his intestines writhed harder and his tongue felt thick . and he did not know if he was breathing , and his hands were also numb , and then he was falling . and then – he was gone . elsewhere , children slept . elsewhere , the religious prayed and the not religious wished . elsewhere , sleepers dreamed . elsewhere , there was a near infinite multitude of lived experience of which we each only get to live one . the next morning , it was blood stone day . scrooge awoke and stood stiffly from the bathroom floor . he went to the window . tiny tim was there on the street bench , backward and chattering , as tiny tim did . all around tim , the people of night vale went about their preparations for blood stone day dinner . scrooge did not see them . he watched tiny tim shake and shake , bending farther and father backward . he watched tim . tim shook . and so ends the story of scrooge . there is nothing to learn from this story . most stories have nothing to teach us . it ' s winter , dear and frightful listeners . the days are hot and the nights are cold , and i hope you have someone out there who cares for you . and if you do not , then know that i care for you . and know that you are never truly alone , for in the darkness , there are always others with you , whether you like it or not . do not open your eyes unless you want to see them . have a happy blood stone day , and good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : the universe contains , among other things , black holes , vast clouds of gas and light , a planet made of diamond and your tiny body .

WTNV|UFO Sighting Reports|14 February 2019|as above , so below . as for the middle , well , who knows . welcome to night vale . we start today , as we often do , with the latest fo sight ing reports in the community . friday , 5:20 am . the staff of the desert spring tuberculosis research center and medication retreat reported a luminous object out over the neighborhood across the highway . the object resembled a straw hat and had an apparent speed of 150 miles per hour , and apparent attitude of 2,000 feet . the staff recalled that the object illuminated the ground brightly , as they could see le ah shaping at the window of her house , receiving a phone call and then collapsing to her living room floor with a hand over her mouth . this was perfectly visible despite the sun not having yet risen . friday , 5:28 am . leann hart , editor of the night vale daily journal , was preparing for a day of hard-hitting journalism . she does this using a dummy that she has set up in the back yard and labelled with a sign saying ` ` pilot to video '' . she was just about to launch into her usual routine of hacking at this dummy for two and a half hours with a pair of hatchet made from pure silver , while screaming in fury , when she was stopped by a sight in the sky . an object the size and shape of a bus , and also having all other characteristic of a bus , was soaring over her . it flew at an apparent attitude of 500 feet , making no sound at all , and leann track ed it for several minutes before losing sight of it . she said that she reacted like anyone would : by flinging a hatchet at it and shouting : ` ` you ' re not welcome here . '' friday , 5:34 am . my niece janice was up early , because it was finally time to take the pre-sat , and she did not want to feel hurried . she had been with herself long enough to know that feeling hurried kills any sense of momentum or order for the rest of the day , and makes her feel like she ' s trying and failing to catch up with herself . better to force herself out of bed into the cold of a winter desert morning than to feel behind herself later on . she had gone out into the front yard to get a bit of fresh air , and had waved to le ah shaping who was rushing out of her house and did not seem to notice the greeting , when janice saw the craft . a red ellipsoidal object rose from behind the line of houses . at first , janice thought it might just be a particularly quick sunrise , but soon realized the object was only the size of a small table and was right above her . remembering what tamika had taught her during team militia camp , janice grabbed a heavy stone from the yard , but the object was already withdrawing . janice yelled to ask if le ah had seen it too , but le ah was driving away . so janice went back inside and made herself a smoothie . she feels she did pretty good on the pre-sat . friday , 5:41 am . dana cardinal , no longer mayor , who carries with her what she has done , but now also carries the possibility of what she could do next , was driving around the city . she does this sometimes , an aimless circle of a town that once had been her responsibility , but now is not and never will be again . the town without a mayor . this is a problem , but it is not her problem . she had just been passed by le ah shaping , who was going some 20 miles over the speed limit , when dana spotted three sparkling objects in an equilateral formation , approximately 20 feet from each other at an apparent attitude of 100 feet . she shrugged and turned back to her aimless driving . this was no longer her problem . friday , 5:53 am . sarah sultan , who is the president of the night vale community college and also a smooth , fist-sized river rock , was driving to work . she had to get in early because of an all-department meeting to address the lingering effects of the rabbit infestation the college suffered five years ago . and she was still fuming from yesterday when the dmv had threatened to take away her license on the ground that no one understood how a smooth , fist-sized river rock was even capable of operating a car . she had had to take the driving test all over again , and while she got a perfect score and retained her license , that had been time robbed from her that she would never get back . le ah shaping , ahead of her in the lane , slowed down to turn into the night vale community hospital parking lot , and sarah swerved around her , unwilling to wait for the turn to complete . as she did that , she saw a spherical body in the sky at an elevation of about 1,000 feet . it was a dozen centimetres across in apparent size and whirled around in a small circle of 30 feet in apparent diameter before rising up into the clouds . friday , 8:09 am . nilanjana sikdar stood just outside of the hospital . she was there for a minor procedure , but it did not feel minor to her . she did not like hospitals , did not like the implication of what might happen there , did not like the doctors that appear and disappear random from room to room , and did not like thinking about all that can missile and malign in her own body . she sighed , looked up at the building , and saw through the window le ah shaping with tears rolling down her face . she was holding the hand of someone in a hospital bed , and she was telling the patient a story , it seemed . perhaps reminiscing about some shared event from much earlier in both of their lives . more importantly , nilanjana saw two flying objects in the reflection of the glass . she turned to see them fly west by north to north by east , radiant blue in the center and red around the edges . then , knowing that not even for could save her from necessary medical treatment , she turned to the building and grudged inside . friday , 11:15 am . high school senior josh clayton was in the ralphs parking lot showing off to his friends by turning himself into any tree they named . ` ` oak , '' they shouted and he was an oak . ` ` spruce , '' another shouted . ` ` too easy , '' he told them . ` ` regional , '' one said and josh took the form of regional from the nearby whispering forest . when he was in that tree form , he could see all the way over the roof of the ralphs , and he saw a luminous flying object that ' s upper half was covered in a curling mist or smoke . it was 40 degrees in elevation above the horizon and approximately the brightness of a new moon on a cloudless night . ` ` whoa , '' said josh . ` ` man , '' said one of his friends . ` ` it ' s so weird to see a tree talk like that . '' friday , 12:02 pm . lorelei avare had been called into work . it was never good news when she was called into work . no one ever rang her phone and said , ` ` hello , is this lorelei avare , night vale coroner ? we ' re super happy to need your help ! '' no . it is always the same hushed tones and hushed pain , tight and business like . she was thinking all of this as she had her coffee and steered herself for what she would have to go do , when she saw an object in the midday sky . it left a multicolored trail as it moved , going to the west slowly and finally disappearing . ` ` that does not help me at all , '' she said and poured the rest of her coffee down the sink . friday , 12:10 pm . tamika lynn was on her way to the hospital to check in on 14-year-old gerard sanders who had been injured at te en militia camp while practicing evasive maneuvers , which is what they call dodgeball . he had badly twisted his ankle and even though tamika knew it was not her fault , she felt guilt all the same , and then felt guilt over her guilt , as she knew she should not feel guilt over things that were not her fault . as she entered the hospital , she looked across the lot back where le ah shaping was standing , tears covering her face . le ah was standing at the parking payment machine , her lips moving soundlessly , her eyes staring blandly at the screen in front of her , and her hands frozen at her side . more importantly , behind le ah , a silver star shining conspicuous in the day-lit sky , moving from east to west , passing in and out of clouds , and changing attitude constantly . friday , 1:20 pm . deb , the sentiment patch of haze , was on her way out of a meeting with her representation . she was unhappy with the advertising jobs they had been securing for her , finding that nothing they were sending her out on caused enough harm to humanity . ` ` get me out there selling the really toxic and dangerous stuff , something with side effects or at least some carcinogens , '' she told them as she pound ed the table with her fists and stormed out . an action that was difficult due to her eternal and listless nature . as she left , she saw a cylindrical fo , a greenish bronze with a three to one ratio of length to thickness . ` ` oh buzz off , bust er , '' she told it . friday , 2:27 pm . amber akin ye was taking a break from her job at the diego and diego and diego and diego and diego funeral home . the one that was opened recently on araburus road by those very nice quintuplets . amber was exhausted after talking le ah shaping through all the option . the funeral would happen in just two days , and there was so much to do and to decide . amber thought that le ah was holding on pretty well , but still , it was a lot for both of them . maybe amber was too em pathetic to work a job like this . she hated to think of empathy as weakness , but she only had so much energy to give . as she was thinking this , she saw a golden colored oblong at a high attitude in the sky above , moving at a steady speed in a five-degree upward climb . ` ` i just got this job , '' amber thought , ` ` i should give it more . i ' ll give it more time . '' friday , 5:15 pm . lieutenant regis of unit 7 of the local national guard station and of combo store was standing guard as usual , and witnessed an ( anchor ) shaped ring of light to the southwest , and at apparent attitude of 200 feet . he waved . ` ` enjoy the weekend ! '' he shouted . ` ` see a on monday ! '' friday , 8:09 pm . janice rio from down the street was having dinner at the moonlite all-nite din er . she had ordered a greek salad with chicken on it and was feeling comfortably superior to le ah shaping in the next booth over , who was on her second plate of fries . as she sat with this great sense of self , janice glanced outside and saw a yellow ball of light with a diameter of more than 20 inches hanging in the sky . it hung silently for two minutes and then disappeared . ` ` good radiance , '' janice muttered and returned to her salad . we pause briefly from our fo sight ing reports to take in something far stranger : the weather report . saturday , 12:01 am . le ah shaping park ed in front of her house , but she did not find the will to go in . what was there for her but the echo of a daily routine that would see no more days ? so instead she drove out to the scrublands . it was chilly , but that felt good to her . it felt like she had been uncomfortable warm for a long while , and this was the first time that the temperature had been right . ( - ) bit at her ankles , she did not have the right shoes for this kind of walk , but here she was , walking . the night was completely clear . the moon was a careful situation . as she walked , le ah tried her best to sort through her feelings . it was obvious to her which feeling she should have in this moment . mourning , a wild grief , a sadness that would never be cured by however many decades of slow forgetting she had left . this was what others had assumed she was feeling and so those were the emotions they managed . ` ` this must be quite difficult , '' the doctor had said professionally . ` ` i ' m so sorry for your loss . i ' m sure you loved her very much , '' the woman at the funeral home had said em pathetically . ` ` oh my god , you poor thing , you must be bereft ! '' said laura at the moonlite all-nite din er with a deep sincerity , and then she had taken le ah ' s order of us many french fries as can fit on a plate . laura had brought two plates . but the truth is that le ah did not feel mourning , grief , or sadness . she supposed that those feelings would not come , she hoped they did , because she did not know what it would mean for herself if they did not . however , emotions are not domestic creatures that can be summoned with a whistle . they are wild and they move as they please . so try as she might to access her sadness , le ah could not . what she could find , to her horror and shame , was relief . she felt so relieved , and she felt free . she felt absolutely free and completely relieved , and she felt that she must be the worst person in the world for feeling those things . ` ` what is wrong with me ? '' she said , and nothing that heard her answered except a lone coyote , who started and fled to a warm groove in the earth , where he felt safe from predator . there was nothing wrong with le ah . she was free , and she felt relieved . later she would feel sadness , sadness that ' s vast shape would hardly be conveyed by such a simple word , but not now . now she walked until she could not see her car , until the lights of night vale disappeared behind the hill , until it seemed possible that no other person lived on the earth . as she stood there , a silver craft descended from the sky . it rotated above her , brilliant , multicolored lights coming from windows on all sides . she watched it hover , and then watched as it rose back up into the sky , until it was indistinguishable from all the other wandering stars . ` ` huh , '' she said , and began the long walk back to her car . this has been fo sight ing reports . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : in europe , instead of cell phone , they say mobile . instead of arugula , they say rocket . instead of letting you die because of lack of health insurance , they take care of you when you ' re sick . it ' s a weird place .
WTNV|Pioneer Days|28 February 2019|we are thirsty . we can not see . we do not know what time it is , we are nearly here . welcome to night vale . pioneer days are upon us again . this is , of course , just the folks branding that the public utilities department gives to random selected days throughout the year , when they cut all services without notice . the lights go out , the air conditions grow warm , the food spoils , the water supply dries up . all residents are required to dress in the costumes of early settlers to make the whole thing feel festive and patriotic . failure to dress in era-appropriate clothing , such as overalls and soft meat crowns , will result in punitive measures . including being called a time traveler in a decorative tone of voice , as was traditional punishment for all real time travelers back in the early days of night vale . polls show that these civic holidays are increasingly unpopular , but this time it ' s going to be different , the utilities department promises . ` ` it ' s going to be way more fun , we swear . just bear with us , you ' re so brave . you ' re all my brave little pioneers , '' the pamphlets scattered around town assure us . ` ` after all , '' the pamphlets continue , ` ` what is bravery but endurance ? what better way to honor the struggles of our ancestors than through personal discomfort and grim acceptance ? these are the values our town was founded on , are not they ? are not they ? ! '' the pamphlets shout . the pamphlets writ he on the ground . the pamphlets inhale sharply and become still . in an effort to sway public opinion on pioneer days , the utilities department has un veiled an interpreting boardwalk and historical display , set up in an open expanse of desert miles from town . the intention of the display is to bring a sense of local pride and education to the community , and to be a fun family centered activity that can take people ' s minds off the panic inducing existential questions that come from being so very alone in the dark . and now traffic . you had a dream when you were young . in the dream , you woke up on the couch after a nap just in time to see your family driving away , leaving you alone in the house . they ' ve never done that before , you ' re much too young , too small to be left alone . there are no lights on and everything is soft with shadows . you see a brown paper bag on the table . they must have left it there for you . is it food ? you do not know how to feed yourself yet . the bag suddenly lurches and tips over onto its side all by itself . a snake slid es out onto the table , drops to the floor , and slippers rapidly toward you . you try to scream . this is the moment you were supposed to wake up , but it is not a dream , is it ? your whole family really did abandon you . you grew up in this house alone after that , just you and the snake . it was not poisonous but that does not mean it was a good companion . it came and went without consideration for you at all , running itself on rocks or squeezing rodent to the death whenever it pleased , sometimes not coming home for days . you cleaned up its discarded skins during the molting season . you let it sleep curled next to your body for warmth in the winter months , even though it could only give back cold indifference in return . but you had no one else , that ' s just how it was . you still see each other once a year during the holidays out of a sense of duty . you follow each other on facebook , but neither of you check that site anymore . you waited to wake up from this dream of your youth to find your family had never left , that they were still there with you . you are still waiting to wake from this dream . this has been traffic . i ' m getting more details about the pioneer day ' s display and celebration . along the interpreting boardwalk , visitors will come to several viewing platforms where they will see the bleached bones of select citizens ' ancestors , scattered across the sun scorched earth . those who won last night ' s ruffle must remit their ancestral bones by noon in order to be features in the display . further along the walk , spectators will be treated to an animatronic re-enactment of the battle for the scrublands , an event in which several key town founders bravely fought against the giant benevolent arthropods that used to exist in this area . as visitors will see , the beasts were all slain easily by our intrepid settlers , as the animals were unaccustomed to violence of any kind and regarded the human newcomers with only gentle curiosity . ` ` they had to die , '' in tones the robotic voice of a mechanical man in a waistcoat , as he stands triumphant among piles of enormous multi-pointed legs . ` ` for they were too visual ly disconcerting to live , '' he booms . there will always be a booth sponsored by the historical society displaying repurposed slide film from random strangers ' family vacation that have ben collected at garage sales over the years . accompanied by places with made up historical narratives about the pictures . for example , there ' s one of an elderly woman playing shuffleboard on a seniors ' cruise entitled ` ` griselda fords the river '' . it tells the tale of when pioneers first got to the sand wastes and there was a big scar y river running through it , and how they had to risk their lives just to reach the land that we now have the privilege to take for granted . a lot of places have a kind of passive aggressive tone like that , actually . if you make it to the end of the walk , you will be greeted by earl harlan , who will demonstrate how to make cherries jubilee , a staple dish among the early night vale frontiers people . ` ` you feed a goose cherries until it can no longer walk or stand on its own , '' earl explains . ` ` then you light the goose on fire until its screams become whispers , and when it ' s finally silent , you extinguish the flames . the goose ' s blackened flesh is full with tar enzymes that are very good for your skin and eyes . the red liquid pooling around it is only cherry juice . only viscous cherry juice , '' he explains as he dishes out samples of the boiling native cuisine directly into people ' s outstretched ravenous hands . that ' s not all . the fully immersion interactive theater segment is last . you ' ll be blindfolded and placed in the back of a cargo truck . hours later , you will step off of the wooden blank and be free to enter into the desert , to try and find your way back home . just like the pioneers did it . you do not realize how the boardwalk is designed to be completely disorienting until this moment , when you step into the endless desert and look to all horizons and see only identical sagebrush and chaparral and nothingness . as if you ' ve entered a mirror ed fun house made only of hot dirt . more on pioneer days , but first the weather . as you wander lost in the desert , you first experience a dizzy ing sense of freedom . you can go wherever you want , the future is yours to shape . the possibilities seem as endless as the vast wasteland in front of you , but when you look behind you and realize you can no longer see the interpreting boardwalk or any other sign of human life , that sense of freedom becomes abject despair . you realize that taking risks is only fun when you have safety net . when that risk is a choice . now that you ' ve been swallowed up into the blistering wilderness , you learn that choice has always been an illusion . you must go forward . the sun sinks lower . the dark air blurs the edges . you feel a cool breeze sweep over the sand – and you are grateful for that . your lips bleed . it ' s nightfall when you come to an old homestead . it has no roof and means to one side . there is no door , but there is the shape of a door , the black entangle of absence . you feel compelled to go in , as would anyone confronted by a structure with an entrance , but you hesitate . you recognize this place , yes . you saw it in the slide film display by the historical society . there was a picture of it taken many years ago . it depicted the same house , only it had a roof back then . it did not lean to one side , and two children , barely toddlers , were standing out front . they had no heads , they had chickens roasting on top of their necks instead . the accompanying explanation said that it was a double exposure , a photographic art form that early night vale settlers dabbled in to pass the time . there was a whole collection of these photo displayed : a bath tub filled with blood . a levitating skull on fire . a baked ham with long luxurious hair . ` ` the first night valets were incredibly adept at trick camera work , '' the historical society insisted nervously when questioned . ` ` camera had come to town at least a hundred years before camera were invented , due to the rampart time traveler problem back in those days , '' they explained . ` ` we found the pictures in a locked trunk buried near the railroad tracks , '' blurted a younger historical society member who was immediately hushed by the elders and delegated to selling merch . you hesitate in the yard , until you can no longer ignore the sir en song of the wind through the broken bones of this place , screaming at you to enter . inside , the only piece of furniture left standing is a kitchen table . on top sits a sealed jar packed to the brim with pickled eggs . your child asks if she can have one . your child is with you , she ' s ben riding on your back the whole time and you forgot all about her . that ' s incredibly alarming . how can a parent just forget their own child like that ? ` ` yes , honey , '' you say , trembling with the effort of keeping your voice calm . ` ` you can have one . '' you set her down and she scampers across the dusty boards , and she feeds . she feeds ravenous . she asks for a bedtime story next , it is her bedtime after all . at least she says it is . you do not know what time it is , but somehow she senses it and you trust her instincts . habits are comforting , rituals are important . it ' s what keeps us grounded . it ' s what prevents us from shouting uncontrollably and clutching at our eyes . ` ` once upon a time , there was a child who looked very much like you , '' you begin . ` ` no , '' she interrupt , ` ` the child looks like you . '' ` ` it does not matter , '' you say , ` ` because it was actually a dog , not a child , be quiet now . here ' s the story . a dog ran away from home and had many adventures and then returned to its family and everyone learned lessons . '' ` ` what kind of adventures ? '' she asks . ` ` unshakable adventures , '' you say . ` ` is this a true story ? '' she asks . ` ` every story is true , '' you say . she ' s still awake . you point through the roofless void and tell her to count the stars , hoping to bore her into unconsciousness . ` ` there are no stars , '' she says . you acknowledge that the thick dark air obscures any light that might be in the sky , but ` ` we can see them anyway , '' you tell her , ` ` because we know the stars exist . '' ` ` how do we know ? '' she asks . ` ` go to sleep , '' you say . after she ' s asleep , you walk through what ' s left of the old house and wonder if this is your new home now . there are many things you think you see standing in doorways or huddled in corners . luckily , most of them are not real . the only thing that ' s truly there is a nest of baby arthropods , bedded down in the tattered remains of a blood stained prairie dress . they appear to be orphan ed , but they are together , entertaining all of their legs and blinking all of their eyes and wriggling as one large familiar mass . you know you do not belong here . this is their home now , as it was their home before , long before there was ever a house . you lift your child ' s sleeping body and enter the desert once more . you look behind you and see the silhouette of a chicken-headed toddler standing sentinel in the yard . it ' s not real , it ' s just a double exposure . as light lifts itself above the horizon , something shiny catches your eye in the distance . you move towards it , because it ' s the only thing to move towards . you do not feel hope or motivation , only the pull of a random fo cal point that keeps you going forward . eventually you come upon an enormous parking lot full of vintage cars . some are early models made of skin and mud and some are mid-century couples with fins and hardtops and spinal columns . hundreds of ch rome bumpers glare in the blinding half-sun of dawn . what ' s all this ? you wonder in the da ze . ` ` hear ye e , hear ye e ! '' shrieks an individual in a tricorn hat , ringing a handbills . ` ` what is this ? ! '' you shriek back , grabbing them by the labels . they do not acknowledge you . ` ` hear ye e ! '' they cry again , but do not elaborate further . suddenly the pound ing of drums and deafening squaw of brass , a marching band is playing . colourful streamers trail through a clear blue sky . it ' s the city parade . you made it to the end of the pioneer days interpreting display and celebration ! you accept another liquid handful of scald ing cherries and stumble home with your drowsy young still clinging to your back . as you enter your own silent house , completely free of all public utilities in celebration of pioneer days , you are overpowered by the scent of rotting ka le in the stuffy air . and you breathe it in deeply . you rejoice . you weep . the only source of water is the puddle on the kitchen door , fed by the constant drip of the defrosting freeze . and you kneel down and drink from it , until you are satiated . things do not look as bad as they once did , do they ? the walls are not closing in on you anymore , they embrace you . the dark screens of your electronic devices no longer reflect your own boredom back to you , they reflect only relief on your haunted face . the inconvenience of no public services pa les in comparison to the night you spent merely surviving in a howling unstable universe . it ' s all about context . it ' s all about managing your expectations . that ' s what the utilities department pamphlet was trying to tell us all along . and of course about celebrating the pioneers spirit , something something forefathers , vintage cars and other stuff like that . but now that i think of it , we do spend a lot of our days distracting ourselves from physical reality . maybe we really can use this time to experience life more solid ly in the physical world , the way our ancestors did . who needs modern convenience when we have each other , right ? hold your loved ones close tonight . after all , you have nothing better to do . i ' m coming home now , carlos . i know you ca not hear me . no one can hear me . the power ' s out here in the station just like it is everywhere else . we have not been broadcast ing anything for days now . and even if we had bee , your radius do not work anyway . but habits are comforting . ritual is important . stay turned next for – whatever you think you hear . good night , night vale , good night . today ' s proverb : the leading cause of death is having a body .
