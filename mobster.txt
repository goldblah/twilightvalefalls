By the time children are three years old, they have gathered a vocabulary of 200 words or more. It’s at this point they are able to string together small sentences and phrases and, for the most part, be understood when they try to ask something. 
That being known, Ted has no idea what his three-year-old daughter means when she, in all the seriousness a toddler can manage, tells him about the mobster under her bed. 
“Don’t you mean monster, sweetheart?” He asks with a patient smile.
“Mobster,” she insists.
He wanders into the living room to tell his wife, who is so busy reading her hair product magazine she doesn’t appear to hear him. 
“That’s nice, dear,” she says, twirling a piece of stiff hair around a finger. “While you’re up, can you get me some water?”
Ted gets her the water, then goes down the hall to rejoin his daughter in her bedroom. Outside the door, he can hear her talking to herself in an animated voice. 
Though he’s pretty sure the voice responding couldn’t be hers. Not unless she’s hit puberty at the age of three. Upon looking inside the room, though, the only one in there is his daughter, who brightens at seeing him again. 
Cautiously, he raises a finger to his lips to quiet her, then sneaks around the room. He checks the closet, behind the door. Nothing. About to give up and blame his imagination, he notices her rapt attention on the space underneath her bed.
Ted gingerly lowers himself to the floor, laying his head on the carpet. In the dark space, he makes eye contact with something. 
“Hey,” a reedy voice says, “fuggedaboutit, pally.”
Ted screams.
