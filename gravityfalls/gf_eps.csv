(dipper scratches his arm) look, kid. the whole ""monsters in the forest"" thing is just local legend, drummed up by guys like me to sell merch to guys like that.  a fat, sweaty man laughs while looking at a stan-bobblehead's head bobble.  stan: so quit being so paranoid! (gives dipper the signs; dipper sighs)  cut to a foggy forest with trees getting blown by the wind.  dipper: ugh, grunkle stan. nobody ever believes anything i say. (puts one sign up on a tree that says ""to the mystery shack."" he starts to hammer a nail on another tree trunk, but it makes a metallic sound. he taps the tree with the hammer, which makes more metallic sounds. he wipes away some dust and opens a secret window revealing a mechanical box with two control switches on top. he tests one control but nothing happens. then he tries the other. behind him, a hole opens up in the ground. gompers bleats and runs away.) what the? (looks inside the hole, and there is a book. he picks the book up and places it on the ground, and checks for people watching. he flips one page and an eye-glass is in it. he looks at the eye-glass and puts it down. he flips another page, and begins reading aloud:) ""it's hard to believe it's been six years since i began studying the strange and wondrous secrets of gravity falls, oregon."" (flips through pages) what is all this? (stops at a page that says ""trust no one"" and starts reading) ""unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed. i'm being watched. i must hide this book before he finds it. remember: in gravity falls there is no one you can trust."" (closes journal) no one you can trust...  mabel: (jumps up behind a log) hallo!  dipper: ah!  mabel: what'cha readin', some nerd thing?  dipper: (hides journal behind back) uh, uh, it’s nothing!  mabel: (imitating dipper:) ""uh, uh, it’s nothing!""

(glances at gompers) let's go somewhere private.  cut to a view of the mystery shack. dipper and mabel are in the living room.  dipper: it's amazing! grunkle stan said i was being paranoid, but according to this book, gravity falls has this secret dark side. (shows mabel a page)  mabel: whoa! shut. up! (pushes dipper)  dipper: and get this! after a certain point, the pages just.. stop, like the guy who was writing it... mysteriously disappeared. (doorbell rings) who's that?  mabel: well, time to spill the beans. (knocks over a can of beans on the table) boop. beans. this girl's got a date! woot woot! (falls backward into the chair, giggling)  dipper: let me get this straight: in the half hour i was gone, you already found a boyfriend?  mabel: what can i say? i guess i'm just irresistiblllle! (doorbell rings twice) oh. coming! (runs out)  dipper: (sits down in chair and begins to read the journal)  stan: (walks in and sees dipper) what'cha reading there, slick?  dipper: oh!

(giggles) don't wait up! (runs out)  norman: (points at stan and dipper and runs into the wall several times on his way out)  dipper: (narrating:) there was something about norman that wasn't right. i decided to consult the journal.  cuts to dipper in the attic.  dipper: (reading aloud from journal:) known for their pale skin and bad attitudes these creatures are often mistaken for... teenagers?! beware gravity falls's nefarious...

(puts hands around mabel's neck)  dipper: ahhhhh!  norman: (removes arms, revealing flower necklace) huhhh!  mabel: (gasps) daisies? you scallywag...  dipper: is my sister really dating a zombie, or am i just going nuts?  soos: (screwing in a lightbulb) it's a dilemma, to be sure.

(backs out)  dipper: (narrating:) my sister could be in trouble. it was time to get some evidence.   cut to dipper filming mabel and norman in the park.  mabel: (throws a frisbee at norman, who fails to catch it and falls over)  dipper: (stops looking through camera and frowns at norman)  cut to norman breaking through a door window to open it from the inside and letting mabel inside the diner.  norman: (stumbles around and crashes, trying to follow mabel)  dipper: (looks out from behind menu)  cut to mabel and norman frolicking in a field.  norman: (falls into an open grave, then crawls out, hand first, screaming)  mabel and norman: (pause, then laugh)  dipper: (narrating:) i'd seen enough.  cut to mabel and dipper's room. mabel is brushing her hair and dipper enters.  dipper: (not narrating:) mabel. we've gotta talk about norman.  mabel: isn’t he the best? check out this giant smooch mark he gave me!

(video shows mabel teaching norman hopscotch, but he only falls over; dipper fast forwards to mabel and norman with norman's arm around mabel) i guess i can be kind of paranoid sometimes and— (on the tape, norman's hand falls off; he glances around, then reattaches it) wait, what?!

(holds up a bag of jerky that says ""you're inadequate!"") you said it brother. i need help.  the ground begins to shake very hard and a large roar is heard. various animals begin flying or running in the opposite direction of the noise  manly dan: for the love of all that's holy, run! (runs off)  a tree begins to fall on the stump that has dipper's hat, and dipper runs and grabs it before the tree squashes it. another roar is heard and the shadow of a creature is seen getting closer to dipper  dipper: (screams high pitched) wait...sorry. (screams on a lower octave and coughs)  chutzpar comes out of the forest and lets out another loud roar, however it is just a yawn. it takes a deer and scratches itself, and throws it away afterward. the deer soon runs off. chutzpar looks over in dipper's direction and knocks away the log he is hiding behind  dipper: please don't eat me! i haven't showered! in like a week! and, i'm all elbows! elbows, and gristle!  chutzpar: you...!  dipper: ah!  chutzpar: gonna finish that?  dipper: (looks at the jerky) no.

6|gravity falls|Double Dipper|August 10, 2012|"the episode begins with soos and wendy preparing for a party. mabel and dipper are sitting on a couch.  dipper pines: oh no, mabel. i-i don't feel so good. i-bbbblllaaaa! (sprays silly string at mabel)  mabel pines: ohhh, grunkle stan, what did you feed us?! bbbbblllaaaa! (sprays silly string at dipper)  dipper: bbbblllaaaa! (sprays silly string)  mabel: bbbblllaaaa! (sprays silly string)  dipper: bbbblllaaa! (sprays silly string)  mabel: hahaha, barfing!  wendy corduroy: (runs up) guys, guys, stop! something terrible just happened!  dipper and mabel: (stare at wendy)  wendy: bbbblllaaaa! (sprays silly string at the twins. they all laugh hysterically)  mabel: (throws confetti) comedy gold!  stan pines: (takes silly string cans and confetti) alright, alright! party supplies are now off-limits.  soos ramirez: mr. pines, whose birthday is it again?  stan: nobody's. thought this party might be a good way to get kids to spend money at the shack. (unrolls a ""pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey"" game)  soos: nice!  stan: the young people of this town want fun; i'll smother 'em with fun!  dipper: (pouring mabel some diet pitt peach soda) maybe comments like that are why kids don't go to the mystery shack.  stan: hey, hey! hows about you make yourself useful and copy these flyers? (shows dipper and mabel a flyer)  mabel: oh boy, a trip to the copier store!  soos: calendars, mugs, t-shirts and more! they got it all at the copier store! that's not their slogan, i just really feel that way about the copier store.  stan: save the trouble. you know the old copier in my office? i finally fixed the old girl up! good as new!  dipper and mabel are in stan's office. they pull the sheet off the old, busted up copier machine. several moths fly around it.  mabel: (gasps) butterflies!  dipper: (lifts the lid up) does it even work? (presses a button, then rests his arm on the machine. it turns on, and creates a copy of his arm)  mabel: (picks up the paper) success! (notices the paper shaking and drops it) whoa!  the picture of dipper's arm comes to life and begins to crawl near them.  mabel and dipper: ah!  dipper: stay back! (throws mabel's soda at the arm, disintegrating it) oh my gosh! mabel, i think this copier can copy human beings!  mabel: do you realize what this means? (pauses) bbbblllaaaa!! (sprays silly string at dipper)  cut to theme song.  stan addresses soos, wendy, mabel, and dipper, who are all standing side-by-side.  stan: alright party people... and dipper. let's talk business. soos, because you'll work for free, and you begged, i'm lettin' you be dj.  soos: you won't regret it, mr. pines. i got this book to teach me how to dj r-r-right! (holds up book)  stan: not encouraging. wendy, you and mabel will work at the ticket stand.  mabel: what? but grunkle stan, this party is my chance to make new friends!  dipper: i... i could work with wendy.  stan: (rolls eyes) you realize that if you do, you gotta commit to stay in at the ticket stand with wendy. no getting out of it, just the two of you, alone, all night.  dipper: (watches wendy spray soos' belly with silly string, smiles) i promise. (cut to dipper standing in front of a mirror in his room putting on a bow tie; he turns to get the spray and sees mabel there) ah! (turns) what?  mabel: (pretending to be dipper:) uh, uh, i could work the counter with you, wendy! let's kiss! (pretends to kiss someone)  dipper: yeah, yeah. laugh all you want, but i devised a plan to make sure my night with wendy goes perfect. (makes clicking noise)  mabel: plan? oh, you're not making one of those overcomplicated listy things, are you?  dipper: psh. over complicated? let me just... (unfolds a huge list) alright, fold that there, kay. step 1: getting to know each with playful banter. banter is like talking but smarter.  mabel: that sounds like a dumb idea for poopheads.  dipper: yeah, see? this isn't banter. this is what i want to avoid with wendy. the final step is to ask her to dance. (imagines a taller version of himself and wendy dancing)  wendy: oh dipper! i'm so happy you decided to work the ticket stand with me; you're so organized. show me that checklist again.  dipper: (pulls out checklist from pocket)  wendy: oh!  dipper: (real life:) if i follow steps 1 through 11, nothing can get in my way!  mabel: dipper, you're the one getting in your way. why can't you just walk up and talk to her like a normal person?  dipper: step 9, sister! (points to step 9, which is ""talk to her like a normal person."")  mabel: (sighs and rolls her eyes)  the party begins. stan walks over to mabel.  stan: (singing:) yadda dee, yada doo, yada doo. (talking:) can your uncle throw a party or what?  soos: (as dj:)the energy, it's electric! uhh, lightning, (presses buttons on sound fx machine, making various noises) lightning, lightning, lightning...  stan: and if anyone wants to leave, i'm charging an exit fee of 15 bucks!  nate: (counting money with lee) we've only got 13!  lee: we're trapped!  lee and nate: (pound on window)  outside, wendy and dipper are working at the ticket station.  dipper: (to himself:) step 1: casual banter. (to wendy:) so here's a casual question! (coughs) what's your favorite type of snack food?  wendy: oh, man! i can't just pick one!  dipper: no way! mine too!  wendy: wait, what?  dipper: uhh... i mean... i mean... (stuffs a bunch of popcorn in his mouth; to himself:) new topic! new topic! (coughs)  mabel: (inside, dancing) go, go! work it, work it! (sits down next to grenda; opens a plastic water bottle and drinks some; she sees grenda's lizard) wow! you've got an animal on your body! i'm mabel.  grenda: hi, i'm grenda. (gestures to candy, in the chair next to her) this is candy.  candy chiu: (waves to mabel; there are forks taped on her fingers)  mabel: why do have forks taped to your fingers?  candy: (puts her hand into grenda's bowl of popcorn; when she pulls it out each finger has some popcorn on it) improvement of human being.  candy and grenda: (watch grenda's lizard eat some popcorn and laugh)  mabel: i've found my people!  soos: remember dudes, (reading from book) who ever, um, party hardies, what? gets the party crown! (holds up crown) most applause at the end of the night wins!  grenda and candy: wow!  pacifica northwest: (walks up to soos with her friends) party crown? i'll take that, thank you very much!  mabel: who's that?  candy: the most popular girl in town, pacifica northwest.  grenda: i always feel bad about myself around her.  soos: i can't just give you the crown. it's sort of a competition thing.  pacifica: (laughs and picks up microphone) honestly, who's gonna compete against me? fork girl? lizard lady? (laughs)  grenda: hold me, candy! (hugs candy)  candy: our kind isn't welcome here!  mabel: (walks angrily over to soos; pops up from behind table; happily:) hey, i'll compete!  candy and grenda: (gasp)  mabel: (to pacifica:) i'm mabel.  pacifica: that sounds like a fat old lady's name.  mabel: i'll take that as a compliment!  pacifica: may the better partier win. (menacingly walks away with her friends)  mabel: (to pacifica:) nice meeting you! (to grenda and candy:) she's going down.  wendy: (looks at party through window) whoa! sounds like the party's getting nuts.  soos: let the battle for the party crown begin! mabel comes out strong! watch out, pacifica!  wendy: i gotta get in there! (to dipper:) cover for me?  dipper: umm... well i, um–  wendy: thanks, man! (goes inside and dances)  dipper: (to the crowd of people waiting to get tickets:) i'll be back shortly! (to himself:) sure stan won't mind if i'm gone for a few minutes. (turns to run inside)  stan: (grabs dipper by the back of his shirt) hey! what are you doing, kid? these suckers aren't gonna rip themselves off!  kid: yeah!  stan: you promised, remember?  dipper: i did?  stan: (plays a tape recording of dipper's promise)  dipper's voice: i promise.  stan: (walks off step by step and suddenly goes back for checking)  wendy: woo-hoo-hoo!  dipper: if only i could be two places at once. (goes into stan's office, lies down on the copy machine and presses the copy button) i wonder if this is a good idea.  dipper is copied. the paper with the copy of him falls to the ground. it ripples, and the dipper clone comes to life.  dipper: whoa! ...i have a really big head.  dipper and clone: so, uh... (chuckles) sorry, you first. stop copying me! (laugh)  clone: (tries to slap his leg but hits his elbow on the copy machine) ow, ow! funny bone!  dipper: (writes the number 2 on the clone's head) i will call you: number 2.  number 2: definitely not. you know a name i've always wanted?  dipper and number 2: tyrone?  dipper: okay, tyrone. let's get down to business. i'm thinking you cover me at the ticket stand, while i ask wendy to dance.  tyrone: i know the plan, buddy.  dipper and tyrone: (pull out dipper's plan)  dipper: (backs away from tyrone) hey, we're not gonna get jealous and turn on each other like the clones in the movies, are we?  tyrone: dipper, please. this is you you're talking about. plus, hey! (snaps his fingers) you can always just disintegrate with me with water.  dipper and tyrone: (tap their heads) yeeah... (tap each other's heads) yeeeeah!  tyrone mans the ticket station while dipper is inside. they give each other the thumbs up. dipper then walks over to wendy.  dipper: great news, wendy! i got someone to cover the concessions for me!  wendy: that's awesome. you can hang out with me and robbie. robbie you remember dipper from the convenience store?  robbie valentino: uh, no. yo, wendy, check out my new guitar. (plays guitar)  wendy: whoa, cool!  dipper: (gasps and then imagines robbie and wendy dancing)  wendy: robbie, you're a stupid, arrogant fraud; but kiss me anyway because you can play guitar. oh wait, i forgot something. (walks over and punches dipper; to robbie:) let's get married tonight!  tyrone: (calls dipper) hey buddy it's me, you. i just had the same jealousy fantasy.  dipper: we got to get rid of robbie if i ever want to dance with wendy!  wendy: hey, dipper! we're gonna go sit on the couch! meet us when you're done.  dipper: oh no! they're sitting on the couch! we gotta think of something quick! (sees robbie's bike) i got an idea!  tyrone: i got the same one. but we're gonna need some help.  dipper: (cut to stan's office, where he is writing the number 3 on a third clone's hat) and that's where you come in number three!  number 3: but what if robbie catches me? i'll be all alone!  tyrone: yeah, makes a good point.  dipper: okay, one more. good point. four dippers. this is a four dipper plan. (makes another copy of himself)  the machine jams.  tyrone: uh-oh, paper jam. (pulls the paper out of the machine and screams as it comes to life)  paper jam dipper: (rising out of the paper and attacking tyrone) nyanyanyanyanya-naaaaa-naaaaa. aaxuxaassuaa-aaaa.  number 3: c'mon, you're not gonna make me partner up with him, are you?  tyrone: (to number 3:) ssshh! don't be rude. (to paper jam dipper:) hey, buddy hey. it's okay.  paper jam dipper: aaaa-kkkkkkkxxx-kkkkxxx-a.  dipper: okay. just one more clone.  cut to pacifica on a stage.  pacifica: (singing:) always means forever (closes eyes), alwaaaaayyyss! (her high voice breaks a plastic cup; whispering and points) forever.  grenda: i used to sing like that, before my voice changed.  soos: pacifica pulls ahead!  pacifica: try and top that! (hands mabel the microphone) oh, and grenda, by the way, you sound like a professional wrestler.  grenda: i wanna put her in a headlock and make her feel pain!  mabel: it's not over 'til it's over, sisters! watch this. (runs onstage) soos! give me the 80s-ist, crowd pleasing-ist, rock ballad-y-ist song you got!  soos: (puts on don't start un-believing)  mabel: excellent. (singing:) don't start un-believing! never don't not feel your feelings! (everyone cheers) (twirls her mic around) watch me do a flip! (lands on her face) that was for you guys!   everyone cheers except pacifica, who looks at the crowd, and dipper whispers something in soos' ear.  soos: dudes, would the owner of a silver and red dirt bike please report outside. it is being stolen right now.  robbie: wait, what?!  clones 3 and 4 ride robbie's bike away from the shack and laugh.  robbie: (chasing them) hey, come back here!  dipper: (to wendy:) oh, tough break. i wonder who those guys are who aren't me because i'm right here.  soos: now we're gonna bring it down for a minute. ladies, dudes, now's the time.  wendy: oh snap, i love this song. (sways her head in time to the music)  mabel: (runs over to dipper) hey goofus, now's your chance to ask wen–(dipper covers mabel's mouth. they move away from wendy) now's your chance to ask wendy to dance! c'mon! go!  dipper: ok, ok. (struggles to go over) i-uh, (runs away the opposite direction) uh, i'll be right back!  cut to tyrone and dipper pacing around each other in the attic  tyrone: oh, i agree. you can't just go and dance with her.  dipper: the dance floor is a minefield, a minefield, tyrone!  tyrone: what if there's a glitch in the sound system?  dipper: stan might get in the way.  tyrone: robbie might come back.  dipper: there's too many variables. we need help.  dipper makes 6 more clones of himself.  dipper: alright, dippers! gather round! now's the time! you all clear on want to do?  the clones nod monotonously and leave the attic. number 10 walks up the soos.  number 10: hey, soos, look! a glowing dot!  soos: oh man, i'm so glad i turned my head. that dot does not disappoint.  while soos is distracted, number 10 puts in a disc labeled ""wendy mix."" the rest of the clones do their jobs as well. number 8, who is sitting above the party, puts a dollar on a fishing rod and dangles it in front of stan.  stan: right, like i'm gonna fall for that. (pretends not to notice, then tries to grab the money) give me that... (chases it away) money, money!  while stan is distracted, number 6 rings a bell.  tyrone: there's your cue. it's the perfect moment to ask wendy to dance. good luck, me!  dipper: i don't need luck. i have a plan. (leaves attic and sees wendy in the hallway) ah!  wendy: oh hey, man. what's up?  dipper: w-what are you doing here? i mean, wouldn't you rather be out on the dance floor, (looks at watch) uh, in like exactly 42 seconds?  wendy: i'm just waiting for the bathroom.  dipper: um, uh, okay. (pulls out his list, to himself:) small talk, small talk, small talk!  wendy: so hey, let's say everyone at this party gets stuck on a desert island. who do you think the leader would be?  dipper: i, uh...  wendy: i think i'd go with this lunatic. (points at a short, sweaty man dancing)  dipper: ha, ha, ha. (puts list away) i'd probably go for stretch over there, uh, because tall people can reach coconuts? (points at a tall man doing the moonwalk)  wendy: speaking of tall, wanna see something? (pulls out a picture with her thumb over one of her brothers) those are my brothers, and i'm, (lifting her thumb) boooop.  dipper: ha, you were a freak! (covers mouth)  wendy: yep.  dipper: you know, kids used to make fun of my birthmark before i started hiding it all the time.  wendy: birthmark?  dipper: uh, no! it's nothing! i-i was-i wa–why did i say that?  wendy: no way, dude! now you have to show me! show me, show me!  dipper: (lifts his bangs up to show his forehead, revealing a big dipper-like birthmark)  wendy: the big dipper! that's how you got your nickname! i thought your parents just hated you or something. hey, i guess we're both freaks. (they clink cups and laugh as pacifica exits the bathroom) wait here?

7|gravity falls|Irrational Treasure|August 17, 2012|"the episode begins with the twins eating corncornos inside stan's car. stan is honking while mabel attaches nachos from her chip bag to her ears.  mabel pines: haha! nacho earrings. i'm hilarious!  stan pines: that's debatable. aw, come on, what's with all this traffic? and why is it all...covered wagons? oh no! no! no! (pushes gas pedal) not today! not today!  a few women gasp in the presence of him nearly running them over. he backs up, and begins to drive the car backwards.  dipper pines: grunkle stan, what's going on?  stan: we gotta get outta here. before it's too late! (sees that his car his trapped between a group of covered wagons) they've circled the wagons! we're trapped! nooooooooo!  mabel: (looks outside her window and sees a cow) i've gotta good feeling about today.  cut to the theme song.  the twins and stan get out of the car and walk around an old fashioned-looking main street.  dipper: man. look at the town. (holds a post card up for a second. when he lowers it, the town is a sepia shade, but it is just due to a pane of dirty glass)  worker: (walking by, holding one end of the pane of dirty glass) dirty glass. we got dirty glass! dirty glass.  stan: ah, boy. it's pioneer day. every year these yahoos dress up like idiots to celebrate the day gravity falls was founded.  toby determined: welcome to 1863!  stan: i will break you, little man!  toby: ahh! (runs away and crashes into a barrel)  cuts to a view of people doing various activities, panning right. people doing candle dipping.  mabel: wow! look! candle dipping!  people doing gold panning. old man mcgucket, who is also gold panning, can be heard in the background, saying ""gold!""  dipper: whoa, gold panning!  priest: (to a man and woodpecker:) i now pronounce you man and wife.  woodpecker: (pecks her husband's hand)  woodpecker guy: i do!  mabel: what chu talking 'bout?  dipper: oh yeah. i remember this. (takes out journal 3) in gravity falls it used to be legal to marry woodpeckers.  woodpecker guy: oh, it's still legal. (puts a hand on his shoulder, where the woodpecker is perched) very legal. (walks away as the announcer speaks up)  announcer: come one and all for the opening ceremonies!  mabel: grunkle stan, you coming?  stan: no, thank you! just remember if you come back to the shack talking like these people, you're dead to me.  dipper: there's a carpetbagger in the turnip cellar!  mabel: well hornswabber my haversack!  dipper and mabel: (spit on ground and run off, laughing)  stan: dead to me!  a crowd assembles around a large stage.  sheriff blubs: here-ye, here-ye! ye olde commencement ceremony is about to commence.  deputy durland: (ringing bell) woo! i got a bell!  cut to the audience, where a robber steals an old woman's purse.  old woman: oh, no! police, my purse!  durland: (rings bell) ring ring! ring ring! woo!  blubs: (chuckles) he sure loves his bell.  pacifica northwest: (comes on stage and taps a microphone) howdy, everyone! you all know me, pacifica northwest, great-great granddaughter of town-founder, nathaniel northwest. i'm also very rich.   the crowd applauds.  pacifica: now if you've got the pioneer spirit, we ask you come on up and introduce yourself.  mabel: (gasps) audience participation!  dipper: i don't know, mabel. isn't that girl kinda like your arch-enemy?  mabel: that's water under the bridge. (laughs and runs onstage)  pacifica: our first newcomer is... (sees mabel; angrily:) mabel...  mabel: yeah! let's get this pioneer day started! right guys? usa! usa!  crowd: usa! usa!  america guy: (while crying tears of joy:) usa, usa!  pacifica: i'm sorry to break it to you, but pioneer day is for serious people, and you look and act ridiculous. (looking at mabel's sweater) i mean, a puppy playing basketball? are you always this silly?  mabel: hey, i can be serious! (glares)  pacifica: you do have nachos hanging from your ears, hon.  mabel: (touches her nacho earrings and blushes)  pacifica: haha, wow, i'm embarrassed for you. (to the audience:) give her a hand everybody!  crowd applauds and dipper looks worried.  mabel: (sadly walks off of the stage)  pacifica: now who wants to hear more about me?  dipper: (to the people standing near him as he makes his way toward mabel) excuse me.  pacifica: (as the northwest family lines up for a photo) everyone say northwest!  northwest family: northwest!  camera clicks, taking picture.  pacifica: (laughs and tilts head) we're perfect.  cut to mabel and dipper.  dipper: (to mabel:) hey, you okay?  mabel: i need some old-timey butterscotch.  cut to stan in his car, which is stuck in the mud. steve walks up to him.  stan: hey there, uh, donkey boy! give me a hand with my car, huh?  steve: here in 1863, i have never heard-tell of a ""car."" pray-tell, what is this magic wheel box?  stan: ah, c'mon, steve, you're a mechanic for pete's sake! cut me some slack.  steve: ""slack?"" i am unfamiliar with this bold, new expression.  stan: i can't take this anymore! (grabs steve by the collar) i'm getting dumber every second i'm here!  blubs: (running up alongside durland) are we gonna have to intervene here?  stan: oh, look. the ""constable."" what are you gonna do? throw me in ""ye stocks?"" (laughs.)  cut to stan in stocks.  stan: aw, c'mon! (gideon, wearing old fashioned, nobleman attire, walks by, humming) hey, nice outfit, gideon. you actually look less girly than usual.  gideon gleeful: why, stanford. i'm just a humble tomato farmer, selling his wares. whoops, i dropped one. (throws a tomato at stan's right eye) whoops, i dropped another one. (throws a tomato at stan's left eye)  stan: ugh! (tomatoes still covering his eyes, looks up at sky and screams:) pioneer day!  cut to the twins sitting near a large statue of nathaniel northwest.  mabel: dipper, can i ask you something? do you think i'm silly?  dipper: uh, nnnoooo?  mabel: i knew it! the nacho earrings, the sweater. i thought i was being charming, but i guess people see me as a big joke. (throws off her nacho earrings, takes off her sweater, and ties her sweater around her waist)  dipper: c'mon, mabel, you love that sweater!  mabel: i did before pacifica ruined it for me. she ruins everything!  dipper: (stands up, turns around, and glares at the statue) pacifica! why does she think that being related to the town founder means she can treat everyone like garbage. someone needs to take her down a peg. (gasps) wait a minute! i feel like i read something about pacifica's great-great grandfather before. (opens journal 3) of course! oh, this is perfect. (in a deep voice:) in my investigations... (normal voice:) should- should i do the voice?  mabel: nuh uh.  dipper: i'll just read... normal. (reading from journal:) in my investigations i recently made a discovery. nathaniel northwest may not be the true founder of gravity falls! i believe this secret is emburied somewhere on the enclosed document. if only i could crack the code. (opens the document, revealing a complex series of letters, symbols and words) oh, man! if this cover-up is true, it means pacifica's whole family is a fraud. this could be a major conspiracy!  mabel: really?  dipper: i got to investigate this!  mabel: wait! i'm coming with you. conspiracies are serious, right?  dipper: oh yeah, definitely.  mabel: well, if i help you crack this code, then nobody could call me silly again!  dipper: yeah! mystery twins?  mabel: i thought you hated that.  dipper: i'm starting to accept it.  dipper and mabel: (fist bump and run off)  blubs: (behind the statue, into a walkie-talkie:) this is sheriff blubs. we've got a code sepia!  dispatcher: (spits out coffee) what?! and what are you doing about it?  blubs: i'm following them right now.  dispatcher: find them and stop them. there's no room for error.  blubs: i understand. blubs out. (to durland:) deputy durland, maintaining this cover-up is the mission we've been training for our entire careers. are you ready?  durland: (ringing bell) woo!  blubs: hehe, if being delightful was crime, you'd be breaking the law.  durland: let's go get 'em!  cuts to inside the gravity falls library.  mcgucket: back in the olden days, pioneers drew subsistence from telling stories 'round the fire. so let's eat some books, children! go ahead, eat the books! (chews a book)  dipper: alright, mabel, if we can prove nathaniel northwest wasn't the real founder of gravity falls, it will finally put pacifica in her place.  mabel: and solving a mystery will prove that i'm not silly. i'm serious. seeeeriousss... (laps up candy from the table into her mouth with her tongue)  dipper: (places some slides into a projector) we just need to crack this code. let me see... it's not egyptian, it's not numerology, it's not, wait-of course! the triangle is the alchemist symbol for flame. lighting the parchment on fire will reveal the secret message!  mabel: it's so obvious!  dipper: alright, let's just light this sucker up and--- mabel!  mabel: (now wearing a hat she made out of the document) mwop! i just made a hat. ugh, i just did something silly again. (blows a raspberry)  dipper: wait, mabel. you folded it into a map! and i was gonna burn it...  blubs: (to a librarian:) we're on the lookout for two kids who might be reading.  durland: we're hunting them down for secret reasons! (rings bell) woo!   dipper and mabel: (hide under the table.)  durland: (knocks row of books off a shelf) derp!  dipper: (to mabel:) maybe we should take this elsewhere...  mabel: this map should lead us to...

(tries to take the time machine back)  another car comes by and catches the tape, pulling it out a long way before letting go. dipper and mabel land flat on their faces on a dirt path.  dipper: when are we?  mabel: the real question is: when are we? oh wait, did you already–  dipper: yeah, i already–  mabel: alright.  dipper: it's the same thing. do you hear that?  buffalo: (stampede)  dipper and mabel: aaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!! (run and fall off a cliff) aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!

(reading:) ""legends of miniature buffalo and giant squirrels have led me to believe there are height altering properties hidden deep within the forest.""  scene fades to dipper walking through the forest  dipper: hmm... (trips) ooh! ah! ow! agh! aagh. (notices tiny deer standing on his chest) whoa. (tiny eagle passes by) huh? (gasps) is that mountain lion tiny or just far away in perspective?

(cuts a crystal off with a swiss army knife)  cut to dipper and mabel's room  dipper: (dipper had took a piece of the crystal he found, and ties it in front of a flashlight. it shines blue, then dipper rotates it so it shines pink) smaller.

(uses flashlight to return mabel's hand back to normal size)  mabel: normal hand karate chop! (hits dipper's hand and takes the flashlight)  dipper: hey!  mabel: (uses the flashlight to make dipper's head bigger)  dipper: oh ah ah! (hits his head on one of the shack's pillars) ah! (tackles mabel and shrinks her head with the flashlight)  mabel: ahh! (attacks dipper and fixes her head)  dipper: hey, give it back!  mabel: never!  the flashlight flies out of their hands.  gideon: curse the pines family! curse stan! curse dipper! curse — (the flashlight lands in front of him) my, my, what delightful manner of a dohickery is this?  mabel: maybe he didn't see us use it and doesn't know it's a magic flashlight that can grow and shrink things.  camera pans to show that they're standing right next to gideon  dipper: really?  gideon: (turns the flashlight on and off) flick, boop, woo hoo hoo.  dipper and mabel: no no no-!  gideon: (shrinks them, from dipper and mabel's view:) gwa ha ha ha ha!

(throws phone at the wall and it breaks, nearly hitting dipper) wait. (laughs insanely) what am i doing? i don't need ransom! i have this! (holds up flashlight) i'll shrink stan and take the shack for myself! (turns to the twins) you'll be helpless to stop me. and if you step out of line, smash!

(looks down at carpet)  mabel: (sitting on cheekums) cheekums, to freedom! (pats cheekums) to freedom! (pats cheekums) oh, you're just a big old dummy-dum!  dipper: (looks at gideon's hairbrush) i have a plan.  dipper and mabel: (slide down a rope made of gideon's hairs; they hide in a shoe and peek out at gideon and bud, who are eating ice cream; the flashlight sits on the table)  gideon: clean me! (bud wipes gideon's face with a cloth) father, could you give widdle old me a ride to the mystery shack?  bud gleeful: oh, i'd love to, sugarpot, but i have a heck of a lot of cars to sell, i do!

(pulls the mask off)  dipper and mabel: (scream)  mabel: loser candy!  trickster: that's right! did you ever stop and think about the candy at the bottom of the bag that no one likes? every year the children of gravity falls throw away all of the 'rejected' candy into the dump. so i seek revenge; revenge on the picky children who cast me aside. i'm made of every tossed piece of black licorice, every discarded bar of old chocolate with like that white, powder stuff on it. you know that stuff!  mabel: i hate that stuff!  trickster: no one would eat me. but now, i'm going to eat you.

(everyone laughs maniacally and then stops abruptly. there is a pause.)  soos: i ate a man alive tonight.  everyone stares at soos.  ending credit. mabel, grenda and candy are taking pictures of waddles with his business man outfit. then the song ""9 to 5"" plays, as the screen shows some meme styled pictures of waddles. ends with the cracking skull's voice."
12|gravity falls|Boss Mabel|February 15, 2013|"the episode opens with dipper, mabel, stan, and waddles watching cash wheel. mabel and waddles are eating chipackerz.  tv announcer: ladies and gentlemen, we now return to cash wheel! sponsored by chipackerz, the chip flavored crackers!  mabel pines: but they taste just like chips! (eats cracker)  contestant spins the wheel and lands on ""cash shower.""  tv announcer: congratulations! you're taking a...  stan pines &amp; tv announcer: cash shower! </td></tr>, <th>stan pines &amp; tv announcer </th>, <tr> <th>: money starts falling down on the man in the middle. when the other two contestants try to take some money, he slaps and punches them away.  stan: i like that guy's style.  soos ramirez: mr. pines! we got tourists at 9 o'clock! a whole busload of 'em!  a bus pulls up and tourists start to get out.  stan: hot tamales, it's a jackpot! soos! make some new attractions!  soos: you got it, boss! (glues a wolf head onto a chicken)  stan: wendy! mark up those prices! the higher the better!  wendy corduroy: (puts a 0 behind a $2 price tag, making it $20)  stan: higher! bleed 'em dry!  wendy: (puts another 0 making it $200)  dipper: eesh, grunkle stan. it's like when you see tourists, all you see are wallets with legs.  stan: that's not true. (looks out the window and sees a family as wallets with legs)  wallet boy: thanks for taking me to the mystery shack, daddy!  wallet dad: ha ha! now don't spend yourself all in one place.  another wallet man comes out of a car.   wallet man: i'm feeling carsick... (groans) blaaaaaaaah! (vomits pennies)  stan: (to dipper:) clean-up on the front lawn!  dipper: (sighs, picks up a bucket of water and a mop and heads outside)  cuts to theme song. a boy puts a penny inside a penny press. a small card that says ""thanks for the penny! -stan"" comes out. the boy sighs. cuts to stan leading a tour around the mystery shack.  stan: ladies and gentle-tourists! looking around my mystery shack, you will see many wondrous roadside attractions. be amazed at the only known photo of a horse riding another horse! (points to a picture of a horse riding another horse, and many tourists take pictures and mutter, interested) that's-that's pretty good! (tourists take pictures) be astounded at the horrible, pre-teen wolf boy! (pulls a curtain revealing dipper with hair glued to his legs and fake wolf ears and teeth) oh! oh, look at him! all that hair! his body's changing, ah!  dipper: (takes off his fake wolf teeth) grunkle stan, this is demeaning.  stan: what? i don't know ""de meaning"" of that word! (he and the tourists laugh at his joke.) if you throw money at him, he dances.  the tourists cheer and begin to throw money at dipper, and he makes an attempt to dance. stan catches money with a jar.  stan: ha ha ha! ooh! thank you!  cut to mabel selling bumper stickers in the gift shop.  mabel: behold! mystery shack bumper stickers! you can stick 'em on your bumper, or over your husband's mouth. am i right, ladies? she knows what i'm talking about!  woman: oh! you are bad! how much?  mabel: hey, it's on the house. that's the mabel difference! thanks for visiting!  stan: what!? (appears behind a cardboard cutout of himself) what the heck do you think you're doing?  mabel: business! ching ching ching! (presses buttons on the cash register)  stan: listen, kid. you don't make money by giving stuff away. you're off of register duty!  mabel: but, but-  stan: no buts except for yours out the door. now shut your yap and get to work!  mabel: grunkle stan, whatever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""? hmm? oh wait. here they are! (takes out a bag of stickers and puts two stickers that say ""please"" and ""thank you"" on stan's face"") wop wop! (chuckles)  stan: ugh. ""please"" never made me any money, kid. (puts the ""please"" sticker on the back of the cash register) in fact, just saying the word is giving me a burning sensation.  stan slaps the ""thank you"" sticker on soos' back as he sweeps by. soon after that, dipper comes in.  dipper: grunkle stan, why do i have to wear this wolf costume? i think i'm getting hookworm.  stan: (laughs) yep. gluing dog hair to your body will do that.  dipper: you've got all these dumb, fake exhibits in the shack. meanwhile, i've seen actual, amazing things in the forest every day! what if you hunted down a real attraction instead of lying to people for a living?  mabel: and you should be nicer to your employees, too!  dipper: yeah! (high fives mabel)  stan: look, you guys got a problem with how i run the shack, take it up with the complaints department. (holds up a trash can.) zing!  mabel: i am going to write them such a letter!

(following him into his office) did you seriously tell soos not to follow his hopes and dreams because he ""couldn't handle it?""  stan: look, kid, let me break it down for you. being a boss is about commanding respect. if you give people everything they ask for, they'll walk all over ya.  mabel: no way! i bet you'd make way more money being nice then being a big grumpy grump to everyone all the time.  stan: ha! you think you know more about business than i do? you think you could wear this hat?  mabel: yeah! 'cause i give people respect! and glittery stickers! (stamps a pink star sticker on her left cheek)  stan: ha! i'd make more money on vacation then you would, running this place!  mabel: then why don't you go on vacation?  stan: interesting...all right, i'm a wagering man. 3 days. 72 hours. (sets an alarm for 72 hours) you run the shack, and i'll go on vacation. if you make more money than me, i guess it means you're right about the way i run my business. but if you lose, you, uh... (writes ""loser"" in marker on a white t-shirt) you have to wear this ""loser"" shirt all summer!  mabel: fine. but if i win i get to be the boss for the rest of the summer! plus, you gotta sing an apology song with lyrics by me! mabel.  stan: whoa ho! you got yourself a deal, missy!  mabel: no, you got yourself a deal!  stan: deal!  mabel: deal!  stan: (slams his fist on the desk) deal!  mabel: (slams her fist on the desk) deal!  mabel: (stamps a pink heart sticker on stan's nose) deal...  cut to stan loading things onto the trunk of the stanmobile.  stan: see you in 72 hours! we'll see who makes more money. (throws his fez on mabel's head and drives away, laughing)  dipper: (comes out) did you just make a bet with a professional con man?  mabel: oh, come on. being a better boss than stan will be a cinch. profit, here we come! (holds up a jar, then drops it and it breaks)  dipper: you broke the jar.  mabel: (interrupting:) we'll get a new one.  dipper: i guess i shouldn't be too worried. i mean, how much money could stan even make on vacation?  cuts to a man writing on a clipboard.  man: can i help you, sir?  stan: i'm here to take all the cash from your wheel. (camera zooms out showing that stan is at cash wheel)  cuts to soos, dipper, and wendy coming into stan's office.  soos: you wanted to see us, mr. pines?  mabel: (turns around in chair and scoots toward them) stan is no longer with us.  soos: he's dead? no! it should have been me!  mabel: whoa, soos! stan's not dead! he's on vacation for 3 days. we made a bet.  soos: thank you for that clarification.  mabel: mabel's in charge now!  dipper: are those... shoulder pads?  mabel: uh huuuuuuh! (shakes shoulder pads up and down) it's just one of the up-to-date managerial tricks i learned from this book i found propping up the kitchen table.  (holds up succeeding in management 1983; drinks out of a mug that says ""#2 boss"")  dipper: why does your mug say ""#2""?  mabel: because the real #1... is you! (holds a mirror up to them)  dipper, soos and wendy: (laugh, pleased)  soos: morale!  mabel: walk with me. with me as boss you're gonna notice a few changes around here. my job is to help you be your best ""selves."" satisfied, everyday, loving life, very much, everyday, satisfied. great listening ears so far! (stamps a thumbs up sticker on each of them) waddles, hold my calls!  waddles grabs the phone with his mouth. mabel, dipper, wendy and soos arrive at the gift shop, and mabel pulls up a chair.  mabel: alright, people, now rap with me. wendy, how can i make your work space more wendy-friendly?  wendy: hmm, well, stan never lets me hang out with friends at work.  mabel: stan ain't here, sister! door's open!  wendy: sweet!  mabel: and soos, i believe this is yours. (pulls out a questiony the question mark costume from a cabinet)  soos: questiony the question mark!? i wish this was an exclamation point to show how excited i am!  mabel: as for you dipper... (holds up dipper's wolf costume and tosses it in a shredder) die, wolf costume, die! i want you to head into the woods, and don't come back until you found an amazing attraction!  dipper: finally! it's time to show stan how a real mystery hunter does it! (runs off, grabs a flail and opens the window) dipper out! (the flail's weight causes him to fall of the window)  mabel: okay, guys! it's time to prove that nice bosses finish first. in the next forty-eight hours, we're gonna fill this jar with six hundred billion dollars!

(pause) get him on t.v!  singer: (over a montage of mabel giving herself a thumbs up in the mirror, letting sunlight in the room, drinking a milkshake, looking at a profit graph that is going down and making a smiley face out of it) whoa, yeah! come on, girls! shoulder pads! make that money! mabel's the boss now! walk in, girls! show them boys! make that money! ooooooo, ooooooo, oooo, oooo, ooooo, ooooooooo!   mabel: (to wendy:) top marks!

(looks happily at the money in the jar)  dipper: (comes up with a large moving bag) mabel! i captured something! this is gonna blow those tourists away! ha ha!

(gives them the note, which says ""stan is sick and needs a bear. -dr. medicine"")  sheriff blubs: well, i can't argue with dr. medicine.  stan: to the hospital, honeypants!  bear: (roars and drives away)  cuts to later in the mystery shack. stan is painting rocks under a sign titled ""real gold!"" mabel walks up to him.  mabel: grunkle stan, how could you lie to those policemen? don't you know lying is always wrong?  stan: mabel, when you get to be my age, you'll learn that you sometimes have to bend the truth for the greater good. (eats spaghetti)  dipper: (comes in) hey, have any of you seen my plate of spaghetti?  stan: (hides spaghetti behind him while turning around to dipper) no... but i bet soos has. you know how he likes to eat.  dipper: this is a dark day. thanks, grunkle stan. (runs off)  stan: see? greater good.  mabel: aaaaah!  cuts to mabel lying on her bed with waddles  mabel: waddles, what am i gonna do about grunkle stan? (as waddles:) he needs to stop lying. (regular voice:) i know, but how do we stop him? (as waddles:) maybe you should check dipper's journal. oink oink. (regular voice:) say oink one more time. (as waddles:) oink oink. (regular voice:) waddles, you genius! (opens journal; reading aloud:) ""buried 'neath a trees stump in the deep forest are the truth teeth, which forces upon the wearer the inability to lie."" hmmm. (cut to stan sleeping at night. mabel puts truth teeth in his mouth and wakes him up)  stan: what? what's going on? huh? mabel?  mabel: quick question. what happened to dipper's spaghetti plate?  stan: i ate it because i have little to no concern about other people's possessions or emotions. (realizes what he just said) that was strangely candid. almost as if i am unable to lie. well, good night. (goes to sleep)  cut to that morning. mabel is whispering in dipper's ear.  dipper: you what? that seems like a horrible idea!  mabel: it's great! now he has to tell the truth.  dipper: hmmm.  stan: (gives them plates) scrambled meat, here it is.  dipper: stan, what do you do in secret everyday during your lunch break?  stan: usually, i spend the hour aggressively scratching myself in places i shouldn't mention. now i'm going to avoid making eye contact by pretending to read this newspaper and going to the bathroom without washing my hands. (leaves)  dipper and mabel: eeeeeeewww!  dipper: well, that was disturbing.  mabel: don't worry, dipper. the truth is always a good thing. (cut to stan in the gift shop)  unnamed man: (to stan:) hey, excuse me. do you think this t-shirt is my size?  stan: never mind the t-shirt! hey everyone, look at this guy's abnormal and unattractive face!  mabel: (leads man away) i'm so sorry. i'm so sorry. (cut to stan doing taxes)  stan: doing my taxes.  dipper: (looks at one of the papers, which has ""i have committed tax fraud"" on it) uh, grunkle stan, why did you write this?  stan: because i regularly commit massive tax fraud.  dipper: you might wanna... tuck that one away there. (shreds paper)  dipper, mabel and stan are watching tv, where a man on a unicycle is juggling..  dipper and mabel: hahahahaha!  stan: sometimes, i think. is this all there is? is life just some kind of horrific joke without a punch line? that we're all just biding our time until the sweet, sweet, release of death?  mabel: (rocks back and forth)  dipper: (shivers)  cut to later  stan: (yelling up to dipper and mabel, who are in their room:) kids, i think i have a growth forming on my back. just wanted to be honest with you guys.  dipper: i can't take it anymore, mabel! we need to take those teeth out of his mouth.  mabel: but then he'll be a liar again.  dipper: could it possibly be any worse than this?  the doorbell rings. dipper and mabel run downstairs, where stan is standing in the doorway with sheriff blubs and deputy durland.  sheriff blubs: so, after further investigation, it turns out that there is no dr. medicine in gravity falls.  deputy durland: you better have a darn good explanation for this.  stan: oh and i do. you see, i lied to you. in addition i've been parking in handicapped spaces, shoplifting fireworks, and smuggling endangered animals across multiple state lines. also, you're fat.  sheriff blubs: (drops his coffee) is all of this true?  dipper: no! no, it's not true. right, mabel?   mabel: uh, sirs, i have to be completely and totally honest with you. our great uncle stan is...is...stan is.. secretly a crime fiction writer!  sheriff blubs: what?  mabel: yeah. he was just telling you about a character in his upcoming page turner, crime grandpa! he's never committed a crime in his life. also, have you lost weight?  sheriff blubs: finally! someone noticed.  deputy durland: wow, an author! can you teach me how to read?  stan: what? author?  mabel: ha ha, writer, master of fiction. good night, officers. (close the door and sighs)  dipper: hey, you alright?  mabel: i can't believed i lied.  dipper: mabel, it was for the greater good.  mabel: yeah, the greater good.  stan: (on phone:) hello? police station? i forgot to tell him about my tax fraud. no, tax fraud.  dipper and mabel: (tackle him)  stan: what's gotten into you kids?   mabel: (pulls out the teeth) we have to find a place to get rid of these! (cut to mabel throwing out the box into the bottomless pit at the beginning of the episode. in the present:) and i never saw that box full of magical teeth again. (sees the box next to stan) oh wait, there it is.  soos, dipper &amp; stan: (sighs) </td></tr>, <th>soos, dipper &amp; stan </th>, <tr> <th>soos: oh, sweet! my shoes! (puts his shoes back on)  stan: i like the part with the bear. the rest of it seems pretty far-fetched.  dipper: mabel, we already know that story! we just lived through it.  soos: if we're living through that story right now, then how does it end?  dipper: guys, do you see that?  they are approaching some light.  soos: what is that?  dipper: oh no!  mabel: where are we going?  stan: not good!  all: (scream as they fall out of the pit and onto the spot they fell from)  stan: where... where are we?  mabel: (gasps) look! the shack! which means... we came right back out the top.  dipper: and i don't think any time has passed. it must be some kind of wormhole.  soos: yeah, dude. that sounds science-y enough to be true.  stan: but that's impossible. no one will believe us.  mabel: maybe this is one story we should keep to ourselves.  all: agreed.  stan: (leans on the sign, which breaks, and he falls into the hole)  mabel: he'll be fine.  cuts to credits.  stan: (falling in silence down the hole; sighs) this is stupid.  </td></tr>, <tr> <th style=""text-align: center; background:#748458; font-family:tahoma;""><span class=""plainlinks"" style=""float:left; font-size:10px;"">v - <a class=""text"" href=""//gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/template:transcripts?action=edit"">e - <a class=""text"" href=""//gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/template:transcripts?action=history"">h - d</span><span style=""font-size:13.5px;"">transcripts of gravity falls</span> </th></tr>, <th style=""text-align: center;

14|gravity falls|The Deep End|March 15, 2013|"the episode opens on the sky, where the sun is shining, then pans down to a view of the outside of the mystery shack.  toby determined: (on the radio) watch out, gravity falls, because at a 110 degrees, we're looking at the hottest day of the summer!  (a squirrel runs into frame and erupts into flames. cut to inside the mystery shack. wax stan melts, the wallpaper curls and peels off by itself, and water in the fish tank boils due to the heat. cuts to mabel, dipper, stan, and soos in the living room, not quite enjoying the heat.)  dipper pines: all in favor of doing nothing all day say ""ugh.""  dipper, mabel, stan, and soos: ugh.  waddles walks up to stan.  stan pines: i'm gonna throw this pig out of the house!  (waddles oinks and licks stan)  stan: you called my bluff, pig.  toby: (on the radio) on the bright side, pun very much intended, it's opening week at the gravity falls pool.  mabel pines: gravity falls pool?  dipper: today?  soos ramirez: pun intended?  stan: quick! to the car!  (stan tries to get up, but is stuck to the floor)  stan: hey, kids, a little help here?  (mabel and dipper pull out spatulas and attempt to release stan from the floor. soos shudders)  stan: alright! off to the pool!  (stan turns around, and reveals that the twins removed the wood from the floor when breaking him free. then he goes off screen.)  toby: (on the radio) and remember to be on alert for random wildfires!  stan: (off screen) wait, what? (he is heard catching on fire) aaaah!  mabel: he'll be fine.  (cuts to theme song)  mabel: ah, the pool! a sparkling oasis of summer enchantment!  stan: yeah, nothing like sitting in a moist tub with strangers. it's like the bus, but wet.  dipper: (looking at the towel soos is holding) why would a sun need to wear sunglasses?  soos: it's best not to think about it.  mabel: whoa, whoa! stop the presses! who's that?  (mabel looks at a handsome young man whose hair is blowing in the wind)  soos: oh, yeah. (eats a corn chip) word is, dude never leaves the pool. people say he's a ""mysterious loner."" (backs away from mabel while eating corn chips)  mabel: is it getting hot out here or is it just that guy?  dipper: it's the hottest day of the year, mabel. besides, can't you go for one week without having a new crush on some random guy?  mabel: uh-uh. (gasps) look at his little mustache hairs!  soos: you are clearly enamored. go to him.  (mabel runs across the pool, but trips across a bucket and stumbles on two men in lawn chairs.)  man 1: hey, come on!  man 2: watch it kid!  mabel: (while breaking her leg free from a lawn chair and knocking over a basket of beach balls) aaah! oops, sorry.  soos: it's so beautiful!  dipper: eh, mabel's all talk. you wanna know a secret? she's never even kissed a guy before. she always messes it up somehow.  stan: oi. women. (a water balloon is thrown in his face) aaah!  wendy corduroy: hey, mr. pines!  stan: wendy? where's the lifeguard?  wendy: i am the lifeguard. i make the rules, sucka! (throws a water balloon at stan) boosh!  stan: aah! she's attacking me with water!  (wendy, soos, and dipper laugh.)  dipper: wow. you work here?  wendy: i found out lifeguards get free snack privileges. plus i get the best seat in the house.  dipper: yeah, you do! (laughs, then whispers) i've been laughing for too long...  soos: dude, are you and wendy having a secret staring contest? 'cause i think you're winning—  dipper: soos! shh! (pushes soos away, wendy looks confused) so, hey, you wanna go chuck more water balloons at grunkle stan?  wendy: i'd love to, but i gotta spend the day doing tryouts. we're looking for a new assistant lifeguard.  dipper: hey, (clears throat; deeper voice) hey. (normal voice) what if i was the assistant lifeguard?  wendy: that would be so much fun! you're totally in, dude! (throws a rescue can at dipper; he catches it) you just have to check in with my boss first, mr. poolcheck.  dipper: your boss?  (it shows a masculine man doing push ups with his index fingers. he turns in dipper's direction; dipper gasps.)  (cuts to the boy mabel was attracted to. he's drinking lemonade. suddenly, mabel bursts out of the water.)  mabel: wow! oh my gosh, how crazy bumping into you even though we don't know each other!  mermando: how long have you been underwater?  mabel: that doesn't matter! (coughs up a band-aid) so, hey! my name's mabel.  mermando: (in spanish) hola.  mabel: whoa! are you australian?  mermando: (laughs) i am charmed by your sense of humor. and your bold lack of water-wings!  mabel: (laughs) you're so funny! and your hair is beautiful...  mermando: no, no it has silly tangles!  mabel: mind if i... (pulls out a comb, and begins to brush mermando's hair)  mermando: why, mabel. you are so forward. (laughs)  mabel: (thinking) this is it! he likes you! go for it, mabel! it's time! ask him out on a date! (speaking) so, hey, you wanna go dry off? maybe hit the snack bar or—?  mermando: i-i'm afraid i cannot! for i have a terrible secret! i must go.  (he swims off, leaving mabel by herself.)  mabel: i'm upset. yet intrigued!  (cuts to dipper talking to mr. poolcheck)  dipper: and that is why i think i'd make a good lifeguard assistant.  mr. poolcheck: hmm... (gets down and sniffs dipper) spf 100? good, i like you. but this isn't an easy job. it's anarchy out there. </td></tr>, <th>mr. poolcheck </th>, <tr> <th>: (it shows the pool being perfectly calm.)  dipper: i think i can handle it.  mr. poolcheck: can you handle this?! (he pulls of his hand, revealing it to be prosthetic; dipper screams) i lost my hand to a pool filter. the pool may seem friendly, but she can turn on you in an instant. which is why you must respect her rules! do you think you have what it takes, boy? do you?! </td></tr>, <th>mr. poolcheck </th>, <tr> <th>: (dipper looks at wendy, who is giving him a thumbs up.)  dipper: sure. i guess.

(cut to stan and soos walking by the pool.)  stan: there she is, soos. equidistant from the snack bar and the bathroom. just the right amount of sun and shade. and pointed away from where old man mcgucket lotions himself.   old man mcgucket: whoo-wee!  stan: the perfect lawn chair. (the chair shines in the sunlight)  soos: the legends that you told me in the car were true.  stan: i just can't believe it wasn't already taken. and now to sit on it, thereby claiming it as my own.  (stan sits down, but a foot rests on his back just as he does)  stan: what?!  gideon gleeful: why, hello stanford.  stan: gideon! get outta my chair, kid!!  gideon: oh my, was this your chair. i had no idea. (whispers) yes i did, stan, i knew.  stan: move it, you little troll!  gideon: first come, first serve! (giggles and rolls around on the chair)  stan: i'll first serve you!  (stan picks up gideon; suddenly the whistle blows. cuts to stan in pool jail.)  stan: come on, wendy! you can't do this to an old man!  wendy: sorry, stan, it's not up to me. (chuckles) actually, it is.  dipper: hey, wendy, i got the job!  wendy: sweet! wanna go abuse our power?  dipper: but what if poolcheck catches us? he seems emotionally unstable.  (cuts to mr. poolcheck doing sit-ups on the chain-link fence.)  wendy: nah, don't worry, man. you just gotta be sneaky about your rule-breaking. race you to the no running sign!  (dipper runs after her, but then sees poolcheck, who is drinking water from the pool. mr. poolcheck looks at him and licks the extra water off his face. dipper then slows down.)  (cuts back to pool jail.)  kid 1: how long you in for?  stan: two hours for roughhousing, but i'm innocent!  kid 2: pool jail ain't so bad... as long as you don't wind up in solitary.  (cuts to a kid trapped inside a pool vent.)  pool jail kid: it's the nights that are the hardest.  (cuts back to mermando. mabel comes out of the water, but then drops under again when mermando looks her direction. again, mabel appears, but ducks yet again when mermando thinks he hears her. mabel then pops out of the water.)  mabel: hey there! (mermando screams) i brought you a sandwich. it's sort of wet, but it's still good. blop.  (mabel puts the sandwich on mermando's inflatable raft.)  mabel: i like sharing things. sandwiches, secrets. (whispers) share your secret, beautiful stranger.  mermando: that wet sandwich does look delicious.  (mermando's hair blows in the wind.)  mermando: oh, very well. but you must never tell another living soul my terrible secret.  (mabel nods.)  mermando: you have to stay away from me because i am...  (mermando pushes his inflatable raft away from him.)  mermando: ...a merman.  mabel: oh, thank goodness. i thought you were gonna say you had a girlfriend!

(camera pans out to reveal a suitcase filled with mabel's sweaters) where am i gonna put all my sweaters?  dipper: what's stan gonna tell mom and dad?  soos: mr. pines will figure something out. he always does.  camera zooms out then cuts to stan on the phone with dipper and mabel's parents.  stan: don't worry, your son and daughter are fine. where're we staying? uh, i put 'em up in this amazing four-star hotel!  a cockroach goes up in flames after touching a broken toaster wire.  stan: (opens refrigerator) what, uh, sure we got— (shakes a near empty gallon of milk) —plenty to eat. (closes the fridge) relax, if i thought i couldn't take care of these kids, i'd send them back right away. uh huh, you too. (puts phone down)  mabel: (offscreen:) grunkle stan, can we order pizza?  stan checks his pockets only to discover they're empty. camera cuts to a wider shot of the kitchen and stan sighs.   scene switches to the construction of gideonland. camera then cuts to a fireplace as a picture of the pines from ""the legend of the gobblewonker is thrown into it. gideon is then shown laughing as he examines book 2. meanwhile, waddles attempts to climb out the window.   gideon: (blows whistle) you! back to your corner!  waddles: scampers to the corner and starts cringing and shivering.  bud gleeful appears with his sad clown painting that stan stole in the hand that rocks the mabel.  bud gleeful: i've been meaning to ask you boy. shouldn't you be celebratin' gideonland instead of stickin' your head in that there book all day?  gideon: father, have i ever told you the true nature of this book?  the scene transitions to someone writing journal 2.  gideon (narrating): it was written many years ago by a brilliant unknown author who learned secrets too powerful for one man. </td></tr>, <th>gideon (narrating) </th>, <tr> <th>: the author is shown burying the book.  gideon (narrating):  he hid his journals where he thought no one would ever find 'em.  </td></tr>, <th>gideon (narrating) </th>, <tr> <th>: the scene fades to the books journal 1 and journal 2 coming closer together with gravity falls on fire and gideon in the background. after that it shows the six-fingered hand, but instead of it being gold, it portrays the universe.  gideon (narrating): because he knew that if the journals were ever bought together, they would unleash a gateway to unimaginable power. </td></tr>, <th>gideon (narrating) </th>, <tr> <th>: the scene fades back to gideon.  gideon: codes and maps had led me to believe that the other book is buried somewhere on this very property, and i intend to find it!  bud: so that's why you wanted the mystery shack.  the scene shows gideon with a shovel.  gideon: that's right, father, it's time to begin the search for the other journal!  the scene fades to old man mcgucket working on the gideon-bot, then fades to dipper, mabel and soos.  mabel: go red car!  soos: go other red car!  dipper: this would be a lot more fun with batteries.  soos moves the red car then it bumps the other red car out of its place.  stan walks into the room and clears his throat   stan: kids, we've got to talk. look i've been thinking and... i can't take care of you anymore. i don't have house or a job. the plan is, you're goin' home. your bus leaves tomorrow, here are your tickets.  dipper: but grunkle stan, you can't give up!  soos: yeah dude, look at these faces!  soos begins nudging mabel.  soos: be cuter mabel! your summer depends on it!  stan: look, i lost, okay? the best thing is for you to be with your parents. sorry kids, gideon won.

(nervously tugs her sweater's collar)   cuts to the twins entering the forest.   dipper: i think this is their hiding spot.  mabel: i wonder what gnomes do out here all alone in the forest?  both: aaah!  they see jeff bathing in squirrels.  jeff: do do do... (sees them) aah! this... this is normal. this is normal for gnomes. scrub scrub. (scrubs his armpit with a squirrel)  dipper and mabel: look at each other disgusted, and look back at jeff.  jeff: well, well, well. look who came crawlin' back. take five, chris. (a squirrel jumps out of the tub) you guys keep doin' what you're doin'. so, changed your mind about marryin' me, did ya mabel?  mabel: ew, hardly. we need your help. and seriously, ew!  jeff: you want our help? after you left me at the alter? no dice!  mabel: but what if we were able to get you a new queen? one even more beautiful than me.  dipper: her name's gideon, and she has lovely white hair.  jeff: whoa. mature woman, huh? hey shmebulock, get my cologne!  shmebulock: (comes in) shmebulock!  jeff: is shmebulock all you can say?  shmebulock: (pauses) shmebulock...  jeff: it's a deal!

(the kitchen is in a sea of fire, so soos runs into kitchen and puts out fire with extinguisher)  stan: (sighs) you're a good man-child, soos, but it's not lookin' good. this whole town loves gideon and hates me. if only they knew how evil he really was!  soos: (walks over to stan, putting his hand on his shoulder) hey, i'm here for you, dude.  stan: the entire lower half of your body is on fire.  soos: (puts his hand on stan's nose, then pats his arm as smoke emerges from his back) shh, we're having a moment...  cuts to construction at the mystery shack.  gideon:  where are you, journal? (gideon takes shovel and starts to dig) where are you!   bud: boy, i hate to interrupt you, but you have some guests.  gideon:  what?   dipper: give us the deed to the shack, gideon, or else.  gideon: am i supposed to say, ""or else what?"" emphasizes well-built guards behind him  mabel: yes, you are supposed to say that. (yelling) now!  suddenly an army of gnomes surround gideon; knock out and tie up guards.  gideon: (gasps)  dipper:  you're surrounded by an unstoppable gnome army, now give us back our deed and get off our property!   jeff:  and let the marriage ceremony begin!   gideon: (sighs) very well. i suppose this deed belongs to—  gideon pulls out a whistle and blows it and all the gnomes covers their ears.  gideon: ha! what do you know! works on gnomes too! (gideon blows the whistle again)  jeff: stop! we'll do anything! how can we serve you your majesty! (bowing) the most beautiful girl we've ever seen!  gideon: i am not a girl!  jeff: really? but your skin is so soft. you moisturize, or...  gideon: (points at dipper and mabel) subdue them!  the gnomes grunt and charge at dipper and mabel  gideon:  i have to admit, kids, i am impressed by your creativity! how did you ever...   dipper: let go! (journal 3 falls out of dippers pocket) oh no!  gideon: no! could it be? is it? (gideon runs up to journal 3)  gideon: (laughing) of course! it all makes sense! (dipper struggles to break free from the gnomes) the one place i'd never think to look! you had it the whole time! and to think i actually considered you a threat! (gideon flicks dipper's nose)  dipper: no! give it back! (dipper reaches for the journal)  gideon: every victory you had was because of your precious book!  dipper: give it back or i'll—  gideon: (interrupting) or you'll what, boy? you'll what? huh? huh? no muscles. no brains. face it! you're nothin' without this!

(the squirrels jump into jeff's pants)  dipper: (sighs) well, that's it. guess the bus should be here soon.  mabel: what? dipper, don't give up! you always have a plan!  dipper: no! the journal always has a plan! think about it, mabel, gideon was right. the only courageous or cool things i've ever done have been because of that journal. without it, i can't help you, or stan, or anyone.  mabel:  there's gotta be something we can do?   dipper: what can we do?  the next scene starts with dipper and mabel boarding a bus, looking glum.  announcer: bus 52, departing gravity falls, all aboard.   dipper and mabel walk to the back of the bus and look out the window to see stan.   stan: sorry kids, it's for the best.  the bus leaves with wendy, grunkle stan, grenda and candy outside the window upset and waving at dipper and mabel as the bus departs.  dipper: can't believe this is happening.  camera pans across to a sign reading: now leaving gravity falls. scene cuts to the construction of gideonland.  gideon: (giggles) i've got it! i finally got it! (running through the living room, exclaiming at bud and mrs. gleeful) get out!  gideon: it's finally mine! at last, i have journal number (places 3 on the table) three?! there are three of them? but where is journal number one? (thumping table) i must have all three for the power to be unlocked! but where could i— dipper! he must know where it is! he gave me the third one and kept the first for himself!

(pause) proba-probably the second one.  the gideon-bot turns itself finding the pines twins on the bridge. the pines twins run but soon find that the bridge had dead ends. the gideon-bot jumps on the bridge.  gideon: tell me! where is journal #1?!  dipper and mabel: journal #1?  gideon: don't play games with me, boy!  the gideon-bot drives the twins to the end and punches the cliff, causing rocks to fall on the twins.  dipper: i don't know what you're talking about! you took the only journal i ever had! what do you even want with these journals anyway?  the gideon-bot takes the twins. mabel resists.  dipper: (hits the hand of the gideon-bot) let go of her!  gideon: ha ha ha, you still think you're some kind of hero?

(dipper hands stan the journal to peruse) it talks about all the crazy stuff that goes on in gravity falls. gideon nearly destroyed the whole town trying to find it. i don't know what it means, or who wrote it. but, after all we've been through, maybe you should finally know about it.  stan solemnly closes the book.  stan: i'm glad you showed me this, dipper... ahahaha! now i know where you've been getting it all from! spookums and monsters. this spooky book has been filling your head with crazy conspiracies!  dipper: but it's all real!  stan: haha. you gotta quit readin' this fantasy nonsense for your own good. although some of these would make great attractions! can't come up with this stuff! mind if i borrow this?

20|gravity falls|Scary-oke|August 1, 2014 |"the episode starts off in the middle of the night with a massive blue light glowing from inside the mystery shack. inside the twins' bedroom they and waddles are both sleeping, but waddles wakes up because of the light. cut to stan in his secret underground lab looking at the portal.  stan pines: thirty long years and it's all let up to this. my greatest achievement! (pauses and looks down) probably should've worn pants. (the machine spouts out some fire that hits stan in the shoulder and he pats himself on his shoulder to get rid of the fire) feisty, (smiles) i like it. (flips switches, looks at readouts) if i finally pull this off, it'll all have been worth it. (stan sits down in his chair) i just have to keep playing it cool; if anyone ever finds out about this... (he looks at a picture of dipper and mabel) yeah, right. i've come this far. who could possibly catch me now? (he pulls on a six-fingered glove and pulls a switch labeled max. power, which powers up the machine, causing a power surge around town, and we cut to a shot of wendy sleeping and gideon in his jail cell noticing the light and opening one eye)   cut to government base, we see a screen with sound waves. agent trigger and agent powers are sitting in front of the screen.  agent trigger: see there! there it is again!  agent powers: we haven't seen readings like this for thirty years.  trigger: is it coming from deep space? (zooms in on screen) an enemy weapon site? (zooms in several times)  powers: just as i suspected. gentlemen! we're going to gravity falls.  big screen slightly changes to an aerial photo of gravity falls, oregon.  cut to theme song.  stan's alarm clock wakes him up, he is still in the secret lab.  stan: oh right. showtime.  cut to mystery shack.  stan: welcome, to the grand re-opening of the mystery shack!  tourists cheer for stan.  stan: we're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk li'l gideon!

(takes mabel with him to the attic)  soos ramirez: i wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.  stan: not gonna happen.  cut to attic. dipper locks the door, turns mabel's stuffed animals around, pulls down the screen on the window and turns on his electric lamp.  dipper: mabel, we've gotta talk. almost losing my journal made me realize that i'm halfway through the summer, and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of gravity falls. gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal. but why? (starts pacing up and down the room) who wrote it? where are all the other journals? what was bill talking about when he said ""everything was going to change""? there's something huge going on right under our noses. and it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.  mabel: bro, you looked at that thing like, a bazillion times. there's nothing left to discover! half the pages are blank, remember?  dipper: (while flipping through pages of journal 3:) i just feel like i'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.  mabel: don't worry dipper!

(a ""u.s. government"" vehicle arrives near the mystery shack, a ""usexempt"" is on the vehicle's number-plate, and a sticker that says ""honk if you want to be arrested"" is on the back of the car. stan, with a scared look on his face, quickly closes the window, goes to the mystery shack's intercom and screams into it)  stan: (from the mystery shack's speaker:) the mystery shack is now closed, everybody out! i will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly!  mabel and dipper run to stan while all the customers are leaving the gift shop.  mabel: grunkle stan, what's happening?  dipper: yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.  stan is walking nervously in the gift shop, a door bell ring is heard and a few knocks after it.  stan: (opens the door with a big smile) welcome to the mystery shack, gentlemen! what can i get you? (stan takes out a snow globe and an u.f.o key chain of his jacket) key chains? snow globes? these rare photos of american presidents? (stan pulls a five dollar bill out of his sleeve as he begins to sweat)  two men are shown standing in the doorway in front of stan, showing their government i.d. cards.  powers: my name is agent powers and this is agent trigger, we're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.  trigger: (points at stan) activity!  stan: mysterious activity? in the mystery shack? you gotta be joking!  powers: i assure you i'm not. i was born with a rare disorder that made me physically incapable of experiencing humor.  stan: (laughs nervously)  powers: i don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth. now if you'll excuse us we are conducting an investigation.  both men enter the mystery shack.  trigger: (pokes stan menacingly) investigation!  dipper: wait! wait, did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?  powers: that information is classified (kneels down), but yes. look. between you and me i believe there is an conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town. (close-up) we're just one small lead away from blowing the lid of this entire mystery.  dipper: are you kidding me? i'm investigating the exact same thing! i found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers. if we work together, we could crack the case!  powers: (checks agent trigger) if you have evidence of these claim, (gives dipper his card) we should talk.  dipper: we could talk right now! please please. c-come in! i have so much to show you!  stan: hehe, i'm sorry agents. the kid has an overactive imagination. and like, a sweating problem.  mabel: (off screen:) haha! zing!  stan: paranormal town stuff is just part of gift shop lore. sells more tickets you know? (snaps fingers)  soos: popodopopo! swag! (sticks ""what is the mystery shack?"" bumper stickers to both agents and puts some funny antennae on their heads)  powers: we have other spots to investigate. we'll be on our way.  trigger: (takes ten stan bobbleheads) i'm confiscating this for evidence.  agent powers: smart move.  dipper: (runs) wait! no, wait! we got so much to talk about!  stan: (stops dipper) hold it kiddo. trust me, the last thing you want around during a party, is cops. (closes vending machine) i'm confiscating that card. (takes card from dipper)  dipper: (gasps)  stan: now how's about you being a normal kid. flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a window sill. (puts card in ""contraband box"" and walks into the living room)  dipper: but grunkle stan! you don't understand!  stan: and don't go talking to those agents.  dipper: ugh! that could've been my big break!  mabel: (takes journal) bro, maybe grunkle stan is right. we're throwing a party tonight! can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?  dipper: i'm not gonna raise the dead. i just need a chance to show those agents my book!  mabel: trust me dipper, the only book you'll need tonight is right here: boop! (shows him her ""karaoke songs"" book)  dipper: (holds book)  mabel: i say kara–, you say –oke! kara– (raises her arms), kara– (raises her arms), kara– (raises her arms). i could do this all day.  cut to party, soos places a nacho bowl, mabel stands on the podium while stan walks to the shack.  stan: (gets shot by mabel's confetti cannon) aah!  mabel: well, the confetti cannon works! (gasps) and the karaoke machine has all the best songs! (reads aloud) ""we built this township on rock and roll,"" ""danger lane to highway town,"" ""taking over midnight"" by &amp;ndra! (grabs microphone)  stan: listen kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing. trust me.  mabel: grunkle stan, karaoke is not about sounding good, it's about sounding terrible, together. (big eyes)  wendy: (laughs; to dipper:) check it out! these black lights make my teeth look scary. (turns on black light) it's like a crime scene in my mouth! c'mon, you love it.  dipper: (sighs) it's not fair. finally i meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town, and stan confiscates their card.  wendy: dude, i probably shouldn't be telling you this, but i'm pretty sure stan hides, like, everything in his room.  dipper: ugh, if i go into stan's room i could get in so much trouble.  wendy: yeah, you're probably right. that's what makes it fun, dummy! (puts party hat on dipper's head)  cut to soos stacking piñatas shaped like grunkle stan's head.  soos: man, i can't wait to smash these stañatas!  grenda: smash! (dives into the stañatas, breaking them and the table they are on) grenda has entered the party!  candy chiu: (picking up candy from the destroyed stañatas) stan's brains look delicious.  mabel: girls! (hugs candy and grenda)  grenda: omigosh! omigosh, mabel! is that a boombox sweater?  mabel: see for yourself!  grenda: poke! (pokes the boombox on mabel's sweater)  the boombox starts flashing and music plays. the three girls start dancing.  grenda: (while dancing:) ha! ha! yes, work it! hah!  cut to the mystery shack's parking lot as some vehicles pull in. gompers is standing on the ""mystery shack"" sign. thompson, tambry, nate and lee are walking towards the party.  thompson: aw, i thought this was gonna be a rave.  nate: thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave!  thompson: (while taking shirt off) i'll do anything for your approval!  tambry: (takes a picture of shirtless thompson with her phone)  thompson: aw, come on.  tambry: i promise i won't send it to anyone. (presses ""send all"" button on her phone)  cut to stan at a table with ""admission $10"" written on the front.  lazy susan: (walks past and hands stan some money while carrying a pie) who's got one good eye and one good pie?  manly dan: (walks past and hands stan money while carrying two kegs with ""meat"" written on them) these kegs are full of meat!  tyler cutebiker: (walks past and hands stan money while looking at his phone and laughing) tambry sends me the craziest texts!  stan: the whole town is showing up! and no sign of those pesky agents. wendy, dipper. how are those posters coming along? (looks at where dipper and wendy were, notices they're gone, and frowns) hmm.  cut to the door of stan's room. a piece of wood nailed to the door reads ""stan's room."" a sign hanging on a nail below it reads ""no minors allowed."" a picture of dipper with a cross through it and ""that means you!"" written on it is pinned to the door. a ""do not disturb"" sign is on the doorknob.  wendy: i'll keep an eye out for stan. you go rustle through his weird old man biz.  dipper: (opens door and walks into stan's room) alright, grunkle stan. where did you hide that card? (opens drawer with gold chains for old men magazine and other items) nothing. (opens closet) nothing. (opens drawer with knuckledusters and boxing gloves) nothing. (opens chest containing fully clothed women magazine and lady swimwear magazine) ew! pretending i never saw that. (ends up in front of a portrait of stan) wait a minute... (moves portrait to reveal a secret compartment with a box labelled ""contraband"" in it) haha, yes! (takes out box and pulls out agent powers' card) i got it! (picks up the phone and dials the number on the card)  powers: (through phone:) agent powers.  dipper: hi, this is dipper. th-the kid from the mystery shack. the one with the, um, ""sweating problem."" i have that journal i wanted to show you!  powers: (through phone:) and you're certain this ""journal"" will help our case?  dipper: i'm a hundred percent positive.  powers: (through phone:) very well. we're on our way.  stan appears and presses a button to end the phone call.  dipper: (gasps)  wendy: sorry, dipper. (shows her phone with the picture of shirtless thompson on it) i got distracted.  stan: kid, why did you call those agents? i've told you once, i've told you a hundred times! (grabs phone from dipper) there's nothing ""supernatural"" going on in gravity falls. (hangs up phone)  dipper: yes, there is! after everything that's happened you have to know that by now.  stan: all i know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days. now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over – you're grounded!  dipper and wendy walk away. dipper looks at stan angrily.  stan: (sighs)  cut to the vending machine. stan enters the code, goes inside it, then checks to see if anyone is watching before closing it behind him.  cut to the party, mabel walks from left to right.  mabel: (to unnamed kids and rich boy:) hey boys! looking good! (to gorney:) gorney! you clean up nice! (to mr. poolcheck:) mr. poolcheck move those crazy legs. (softly:) you-you weird pool man. (to sheriff blubs and deputy durland:) what's the problem officers? did you catch my face going ninety smiles per hour?  durland: we've got complaints about the loudest party in town.  blubs: three words: we want in.  mabel: (lifts up party horns and put them in durland and blubs' mouths; whispers:) welcome to your dreams!  blubs and durland: (blows party horns)  cut to mystery shack parking lane, the government vehicle from earlier appears. agent trigger and agent powers get out of it. they look at their watches.  dipper: guys, i'm so glad to see you. working together we can crack all of the big questions of gravity falls! (agents look at each other) trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for. (gives book to agents, they start reading) i'm thinking full scale investigation. forensics, researchers. do you guys have a helicopter? (chuckles) i'm sorry, ""helicopters.""  powers: kid, i'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop. (points backwards) i mean, leprecorn? i can't be the only one who thinks that's not funny.  trigger: i can confirm. (shakes his head) not funny.  dipper: no, no, no! it's real, i swear! you should ""send it to the lab."" am i saying that right?  powers: (hands dipper back the journal) your uncle was right about that overactive imagination of yours. we've got paperwork to do, kid.  trigger: boring. paperwork.  dipper: wait! this book is real. (flipping through pages) gnomes, cursed objects, spells! listen! uh, uh, corpus levitus! diablo dominus! mondo vicium!  ""vicium"" echos through the air, as a large gust builds up. the ground starts shaking.  dipper: huh?  both agents: aah!  a huge crack forms between dipper's feet he jumps away and lands near the agents. green smoke comes out of the crack. a zombie slowly climbs out and roars.  dipper: ha, a zombie! a real, actual, zombie. see? spooky journal, 100% real. now can we work together?  powers: mother of all that is holy!  trigger: what do we do?  dipper: it's just one zombie, trust me i see stuff like this all the time  dipper scans trough his journal, looking for a solution. then after a few seconds the zombie roars in his face about to bite him.  dipper: (screams)  agent powers quickly hits the zombie with a rock, knocking it out.  dipper: whew. oh, good thing it was just that one.  the ground starts shaking again more cracks form, more green smoke, and suddenly hundreds of zombies appear and start going after dipper, agent trigger, and agent powers.  dipper: oh my gosh! you guys can help right?!  powers: kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years but we have never seen anything like this before!  trigger: get down! (zombies tackle them)  zombies pull the agents into the darkness of the forest, leaving dipper by himself.  dipper: oh, my gosh, what have i done?!  cuts to the party were everyone is happy, dancing, and having a good time. then show the police rapping.  blubs: (singing karaoke:) what up, fools. it's blubs and durls.  deputy durland: (singing karaoke:) making all that money and gettin' them girls!  mabel: (talking to the crowd of the party:) what do you say guys is this party legendary? when i say ""mabel"" you say ""pines""!  the ground starts shaking.  mabel: mabel!  woman: (screams)  mabel: mabel!  man: we're all gonna die!!  mabel: why does that never work?  wendy: whoa, whoa! i think it's an earthquake! (blows airhorn) hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!  candy: we are all doomed!  grenda: quick, into my getaway pouch.  candy jumps into grenda's backpack.  grenda: mabel, escape while you still can!  mabel: wait, no! don't leave! we haven't even done our family karaoke song yet!  dipper runs into the party (soos and mabel are the only ones left). mabel notices the zombies following dipper.  mabel: dipper, what's the one thing i asked you not to do tonight?  dipper: (sounding ashamed:) raise the dead.  mabel: and what did you do?  dipper: (sounding ashamed:) raise the dead.  as the zombies get closer, mabel and dipper back up as soos heroically steps in front to protect them.  soos: stay back dudes, this is about to get intense.  zombie knocks over a table, forcing them into a dead end, as the zombies surround them  all: (scream)  soos: sorry, one second. (takes out his phone and takes a picture) you got to admit this is pretty cool.  (commercial break)  dipper: zombies!!  mabel: don't panic. maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob?!  a zombie swings and almost hits their heads before they duck. they run behind soos while screaming.  soos: dudes, stay calm. i've been training for this moment my whole life. with all the horror movies i've seen, i literally know all there is to know about to avoid zombies.  a zombie bites soos, and he becomes a zombie.  soos: second thought, gonna flip the script. can i, eat your brains? yea or nay? seeing some yea faces over here.  dipper and mabel: (scream)  they run around the side of the house, soos and the other zombies in slow pursuit. dipper slices through a zombie with his shovel.  dipper: quick! the golf cart!  zombies attack the golf cart, tipping it over and biting at it.  dipper: aw, come on!  soos: hoo, that's a bummer. good news for me though, ha ha.  dipper: soos!  soos: sorry, dude, i just really want those brains!  dipper: stay back!  dipper hits a colorful disco ball at the zombies. one of the zombies catches it in its mouth and swallows it, sending rays of colorful light shining out between its ribs. they continue advancing toward the twins, who stand in fear.  soos: give it up, dudes! your fighting only makes us look more rad!  mabel: what do we do? where's grunkle stan?  dipper: how's he supposed to help? he doesn't even believe in the supernatural!  cut to the secret lab, the portal glowing and making a zapping noise. stan is in his chair, pushing buttons.  stan: those agents could ruin everything. darn kid! he has no idea what he's messing with. (he picks up journal 1) he's stubborn, that's his problem. (looks at his face reflected in the cover) sorta like me, i suppose. (puts the journal down) ugh, i got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now. all right, let's see...  a screen behind him shows dipper, mabel, and waddles running from the zombies. cut to outside. a zombie pops up in front of the twins.  mabel: take that, sucka! (she hits the zombie with the karaoke machine. its head flies off) this thing's a surprisingly good weapon!  more zombies approach behind them. the kids scream and run into the shack.  dipper: quick! we need to board up all the windows!  they pile things in front of the door, blocking it. the zombies press against the door and begin to break it.  dipper: (while backing up:) okay, maybe that'll hold 'em.  the window crashes open. soos leans in.  soos: hey dudes! by the way, i taught the zombies how to get into the fuse box. among these dudes i'm like a genius, haha!  the shack lights go out, with red light pouring in from outside. zombies start climbing in through the window.  soos: get those brains, dawg!  dipper: (runs for the other door, just as a zombie hand smashes through. he gasps and backs into the corner with mabel)  mabel: dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?!  dipper: (frantically looking through the journal:) no! there's nothing in here about weaknesses! (sighs) this can't be happening. i wanted answers so bad i put everyone in danger. now we're toast, it's all my fault, and no one can save us!  a zombie grabs dipper's arm and lifts him up. mabel screams.  dipper: ah, no! mabel, i'm sorry!  mabel: dipper!  dipper screams, the zombie opens it's mouth, when suddenly—""smash!""—it is hit with a baseball bat and drops dipper, and its head is crushed by the foot of—  stan: (standing in a heroic stance, panting, his clothes torn and hat gone. gesturing to the twins:) you two! attic! now!  dipper: grunkle... grunkle stan?!  stan: i said now! (as dipper, mabel, and waddles flee and the zombies approach:) all right, you undead jerks, you ready to die twice?!  the twins run through the living room, stan following, fighting off zombies.  stan: the only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me! take that! and that!  stan: eat it, no eyes! (a zombie growls and bites the baseball bat in half, only be punched by stan's brass-knuckle-wearing fists) anyone else wanna piece?!  he continues bashing zombies, then backs up the stairs as more enter from the front door. at the top of the stairs he pushes over a grandfather clock with a grunt, sending it tumbling into the horde of zombies. the twins run into their room and slam the door. they back away as something starts breaking in. the door opens to reveal stan, who coughs and clutches his side.  stan: oh! ow. everything hurts. (he turns and closes the door, barricading it with a chair)  dipper: grunkle stan, that was amazing! are you alright! heh heh, well, at least you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?  stan: (pause) kid, i've always known.  dipper: wait, what are you talking about?  stan: i'm not an idiot, dipper! of course this town is weird! and the one thing i know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous! (a zombie's hand breaks through the door. the group backs into the center of the room) i've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it. to try to protect you from it!  a zombie breaks through the window. stan punches it and watches it fall to the ground, where a crowd of zombies is staring up at the shack. more start crawling up the outside walls.  stan: it looks like i didn't lie well enough.  mabel: what do we do, what do we do?  dipper: (pacing across the room) well, normally the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies! (he pauses by a black light, and it glows on the journal, revealing glowing text) it's hopeless!  mabel: wait, wait, wait! the text! it's glowing in the black light!  dipper: what? (he flips through the journal, with mabel and grunkle stan watching. the pages are covered with previously hidden notes) all this time i thought i knew all the journal's secrets, but they're written in some kind of invisible ink!  stan: invisible ink?  dipper: this is it! (reading:) ""zombies have a weakness! previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."" three part harmony, how can we create that? i have a naturally high-pitched scream...?  stan: i can make noises with my body? sometimes intentionally.  mabel: boys, boys. i think you're both missing the obvious solution.  cut to the zombies outside crowding the mystery shack. they wander through the gift shop, when a noise comes from a microphone.  mabel: (through mic:) hello? hello? is this thing on?  the zombies start walking outside. soos walks through the living room.  soos: (notices tv) ooh, gossiping housewives is on! (he sits to watch. a zombie calls him from outside) eh, i already sat down.  the zombies gather outside. dipper, grunkle stan, and mabel are on the roof awning, each holding a microphone.  mabel: zombies and gentlemen! i'm mabel, they're dipper and stan, and together we're love patrol alpha!  dipper: i never agreed to that name.  mabel: hit it!  ""taking over midnight"" starts playing.  stan: (looks at lyrics) uh, mabel, our lives may not be worth this.  dipper: (singing:) ""friday night, and we're gonna party 'til dawn. don't worry, daddy, (questioningly) i've got my favorite dress on?!"" (covers mic) mabel, this is stupid!  mabel: (singing:) ""roll in to the party, the boys are lookin' our way. we just keep dancing', we don't care what they say!"" (zombies start crawling up the roof) ""and all the boys are gettin' up in my face–"" (a zombie grabs at them) aah! guys, we have to sing together or it won't work!""  stan: (singing:) ""boys are a bore, let's show 'em the door.""  all three: (singing:) ""we're takin' over the dance floor! oh-oh! girls do what we like!""  a sound wave goes out, causing the zombies to cover their ears. a few of their heads explode.  all three: (singing:) ""oh-oh! we're taking over tonight! oh-oh! girls do what we like! oh-oh! we're taking over tonight!""  they sing to the night as more zombies' heads explode.  all three: (singing:) ""we're queens of the disco! oh-oh! girls do what we like! oh-oh! we're taking over tonight!""  dipper: (singing:) ""takin' over tooniiiiight!""  as the guitar riff plays, a zombie pops up and dipper screams.  mabel: duck! (shoots it with confetti cannon. its head lands in the punch bowl as the rising sun illuminates the corpses of all the zombies) thank you! we'll be here all night!  stan: deal with it, zombie idiots! (laughs maniacally)  all: (chant:) pines! pines! pines! pines!  cut to the ravaged living room. stan puts on his fez.  dipper: i'm sorry about this, guys. i totally ruined everything.  mabel: dipper, are you kidding me? i got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world! no party could ever top that.  stan: kids, listen. this town is crazy. so you need to be careful. i don't know what i'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch. i'll let you hold on to that spooky journal, as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense, and not go looking for trouble.  dipper: okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.  stan: (crosses his fingers behind his back) promise.  dipper: promise. (crosses his fingers behind his back)  stan: man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up. where's my handyman anyway?  soos: brains! braaains!  stan: holy moses! (grabs a chair, almost hits zombie soos)  dipper: wait! there's a page in here about curing zombification. it's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.  mabel: ooh, and cinnamon!  dipper: come on soos, let's fix you up.  soos: brains! braaains!  mabel: (prodding soos out of the room) soos, cut it out!  soos: heheh, sorry dude!  dipper: i can't believe it! all this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight! (pulls out a portable black light and shines it on the journal) a whole new chapter of mysteries to explore...  cut to end credits.  agents powers and trigger climbs out of a ditch  trigger: that was insane! i've never seen anything like it! who do we report to?  powers: (pulls a zombie head off his jacket and watches it dissolve in his hand) this is bigger than we imagined. we need to bring in the big guns.  trigger: but they'll never believe us!  powers: then we'll make them believe us. this is the town we've been searching for.  toby walks by, swinging for a piñata and making weird noises.  trigger: aah! another zombie!  powers: drop your weapon! drop your weapon!  toby lifts his blindfold and looks at the agents.  agents: oh, it's just—who is that guy?—just a very ugly man.  code: smofzqa jdf (welcome back decoded from vigenere. the key is widdle) </td></tr>, <tr> <th style=""text-align: center;

21|gravity falls|Into the Bunker|August 4, 2014  |"episode starts at wendy's house, where dipper and wendy are watching nearly almost dead but not quite!  trixandra: what do we do, chadley? i thought they were dead!  chadley: far worse, trixandra! they're... nearly almost dead but not quite!  trixandra: (screams)  dipper pines: man, these movies are a lot less scary when you actually fought real zombies.  wendy corduroy: (to the tv:) they're slow! just power-walk away from them!  dipper: (pokes wendy with his elbow) how much you want to bet that guy dies first?  tv: (chomping noise)  chadley: aah! my face is being eaten a lot!  wendy and dipper: (laugh)  wendy: chadley ain't pretty no more.  (wendy's phone buzzes)  wendy: one second. (grabs phone) ugh, another text from robbie!  dipper: oh, yeah! robbie. how's, uh, how's all that going? (making circles with his finger)  wendy: ugh, i'm over him, i just wish he was over me! just look at these texts. (shows dipper her phone) winky frown? what does that even mean?  dipper: and you're not... (cough) not like, seeing any other guys or...  wendy: of course i am, meet my new boyfriend, dude. (hugs plush walrus)  dipper: (laughs) right, right. (nervous laugh) so, i was wondering if maybe you wanted to maybe if, you know, you and me, whatever. i mean if maybe you (grimaces) wanted to join me and mabel on this mystery hunt? tomorrow? conspiracy stuff and all that?  wendy: yeah, dude. i love doing all that junk with friends. (to tv:) yo chadley, watch out!  dipper: yeah, that's what we are. (looks at a note he had written about confessing his crush on wendy) that's all we'll ever be. (crumples it up, lies back on wendy's bed) friends.  wendy: dude, you're laying on my bra.  dipper: hu—? (screams)  cut to theme song.  workmen are fixing up the nearly destroyed mystery shack.  stan pines: hey, easy with that, it's genuine plastic! and repave the cracks in the parking lot while you're at it! (looking into chasm) i don't want my car falling into china!  workman: mr. pines, what exactly caused all this damage? i need to write a report.  stan: uhhh, big woodpecker.  gift shop sign falls over.  stan: keep the change. (stuffs several bills into the workman's front pocket) ...i'm winking under my eye patch.  workman: works for me.  stan: (lifts his eye patch, looks around) now where'd those kids run off to?  (dipper, mabel, and soos are standing around the tree that contained journal 3)  dipper: (taps a pen on his lantern) thank you all for coming.  mabel pines: hey, when there's a mystery, you can count on your sister...-ey.  soos ramirez: (laughs) that's an amazing rhyme. when you want some, good... when you need a soos, you... oh oh, gosh, i don't know.  dipper: we're here to solve the number one mystery in gravity falls; who wrote this journal?! thirty years ago the author vanished without a trace. but according to this new clue, (turns on portable black light) we may have found his secret hiding place. (the black light reveals hidden drawings on the page) we find that author, we learn the answers to everything. we just need to figure out a way to get down there.  wendy: chop it down, dudes! (arrives on bike, rings bell)  mabel: wendy!  dipper: oh, hey! you came.  wendy: dude, i'm so stoked about this. i've been wanting to go adventuring with you guys. sure beats picking up after my dad at home.  cut to manly dan at home.  manly dan: (repeatedly hits his head on the low ceiling and knocks down a beam) ow!, ow! ow! who put that wall there? ow!  cut back to the gang.  wendy: thanks for the invite, man!  dipper: (flustered:) of course, anytime you wanna.. i, we're always... us.  mabel: uh oh! (pokes dipper) inviting wendy on our mission? me thinks there's romance afoot!  dipper: no, look i've thought this through and i'm over wendy. i've looked at it from every angle, and that thing was going nowhere. i know what matters to me now, and it's finding the author of this journal.  mabel: hah! you're over wendy?! allow me to put on my ""skepticals."" (makes circles around her eyes with her fingers) whooop!  dipper: i've moved on, mabel. you should too.  mabel: skepticals...  wendy: hey, is it just me, or does that branch kinda look like a lever?  dipper turns his back on the tree. wendy uses her belt to start climbing up the tree.  dipper: huh, yeah. but how do we get up there...? it seems we'd need like a ladder, or like, ladder shoes... yeah, ladder shoes. i'll get soos to draw up a prototype.  wendy: (at the lever-branch now, pulls an ax out of her belt, swings it around and hits the lever) boosh.  soos: whoa ho-ho!  mabel: (gasps) wow!  wendy: oh yeah, my dad used to make me compete in these lumberjack games when i was a kid. guess i kinda ruled at it.  the tree begins shaking. three crows fly away.  wendy: whoa, what is that? (falls down, screaming)  at the bottom, the ground and tree sink down, taking wendy with it. the others pull her out before she falls in. they stand around it as a staircase to the middle of the tree appears, and subsequently a door inside the tree opens.  dipper: alright guys, this is it. remember, whatever happens down there, we tell no one.  mabel: (gives thumbs up)  soos: (turns hat backwards)  wendy: (zips her lips)  dipper: (holds up a lantern) now, who wants to go first?  all: (walk down the staircase and into a room)  mabel and soos: whoa!  dipper: cool!  wendy: this is so, stupid cool!  dipper: it's like a fallout shelter or something. it must've belonged to the author.  wendy: (takes the fallout shelter poster off the wall and dusts it off) this is going over my bed.  mabel: (puts face in a barrel and comes out with caterpillars on her face) haha! my face feels fuzzy!  dipper: this is incredible! it's like he was preparing for a disaster. but what kinda disaster would need supplies for over sixty years? (looks up a shelf with dated boxes, the highest labeled 2070)  soos: (opens weapons locker) oh my gosh! a smez despenser! i remember these things. what's that, yes i will have some of your old-timey face food. (eats candy from dispenser) ew, dusty! (eats a second piece)  dipper: (holding dripping bean can) wait guys, i think this can was opened recently.  soos: the author might still be alive, down here!  wendy: wait a minute... (wendy pulls it down a map of gravity falls from 1982, revealing an open hatch cover) i think i know where he might have gone... (leads everyone in crawling through the tunnel) whoa! (leads into a room made of metal cubes) whoa! oh, man! was this place built in the past or the future?  soos: this room is way creepy.  mabel: not as creepy as dipper's internet history! heyo! (shoves dipper, and he steps on the square with the design and it depresses, causing the hatch to slam and lock. the symbols on the other wall squares glow red, a buzzer sounds and the room starts to shake. some squares start to poke into the room)  soos: what's goin' on, dude?  all: (pressing up against wall, beginning to panic)  mabel: haha, it's hard to be scared with caterpillars on your face. wall things! crazy wall things happening right now!  wendy: (tries to push the blocks back in) it won't stop!  mabel: dipper! what do we do?!  dipper: (flips frantically through the journal and stops at a page labeled ""security room."" he shines the blacklight on it) oh, come on! (shows them a page with symbol on it) find these four symbols! quick! everybody step on one!  soos: one! (pushes symbol)  wendy: two! (punches symbol)  mabel: three! (jumps over and slaps the symbol)  dipper: four! (climbs up blocks and taps symbol; a door opens on the other side of the room)  mabel: run for it!  all: (run out; dipper's vest get caught in the block, he slips out)  wendy: yes! yes! that was, huh, that was nuts! (to dipper:) you ruled back there, man!  dipper: haha, thanks.  wendy: get a load of this crazy surveillance room.  soos: check it out dudes! (makes faces with beakers in front)  wendy: soos, soos... that is hilarious.  mabel: (to dipper:) hey bro, you forgot your vest. (walks over to dipper's vest and pulls it out, causing the note fall to the floor) what the..? (reading aloud:) ""dear wendy, i've always had a crush on..."" (gasps and covers her mouth with the note. excitedly, to herself:) ohmygosh! (to dipper:) hey. dipper! look what i found...  dipper: (gasps) what did you...? give me that! (snatches it)  mabel: i know it! i know it! i know it! you're not over wendy at all! (gasps) and you were gonna tell her today?  dipper: no, i changed my mind; it's a bad idea. i'd embarrass myself and then i'd be another guy she hates, like robbie.  mabel: dipper, you should just tell her already. one way or another, you'll feel better afterwards.  dipper: look, mabel, i can't tell her no matter how much i want to, so just drop it ok?  wendy: dude! dipper, you gotta check out this weird metal closet. (robot voice:) i am a robot, i have a metal closet.  dipper: (to wendy:) coming! (to mabel:) this never happened.  mabel: (thinking:) he wants to tell her but he's scared; maybe he needs a little push. good idea, mabel. thanks, mabel! (runs and hugs dipper. speaking:) brother, whatever happens i just you need to know something: this is for your own good.   dipper: what?   mabel: (shoves him into the closet with wendy and shuts it)  dipper: what the-? (looks at wendy, gasps and pounds on the door) mabel! let us out!  mabel: oh, i'll let you out dipper, as soon as you tell wendy that thing you've been wanting to tell her! you'll thank me for this later!  wendy: what is she talking about?  dipper: nothing! mabel's just been eating raw sugar packets again.  mabel: (eating raw sugar packets) om nom... that's besides the point!  dipper: let me out right now! (pounds on the door)  wendy: uh! where are the lights? (pulls cord)  dipper and wendy: ahhh!  water gushes down, followed by a blast of hot air that pushes them together. a red light flashes and a tone sounds. a sign reading ""decontamination complete"" flashes and doors open on a wrecked underground room.  dipper: whoa! a hidden lab! maybe the author did experiments down here.  wendy: huh. what do you think dug all these tunnels?  dipper: lets hope we don't find out. (hears a growling sound, screams and runs as a dark figure approaches) mabel, open up, for real! there's a monster in here!  mabel: ha ha, nice try! the only monsters are your own inner demons, dipper!  soos: that is so wise.  wendy: dipper, just say whatever mabel wants you to say, so she'll let us out of here!  mabel: come on dipper! now's the time, bro!  dipper: wendy, i— i— i'm gonna find another way out! (grabs wendy's hand and pulls her in the other direction)  wendy: wait, what? dude, where are we going? (they run down a tunnel and the thing corners them there) what do we do?  dipper: i don't know! (they watch as the shadows of a man and the creature fight)  unknown man: back, back you heinous beast! (walks forward into view) well, i just ripped out a monster's tongue. (throws it down on the ground in front of them)  dipper: it's, it's you!  unknown man: hurry now, i scared it off, but it'll regenerate. (leads them down the tunnel) i wasn't expecting guests. i've been down here for a very long time. years! weeks, maybe! i miss orange juice.  dipper: you don't understand, you're the guy i've been looking for!  wendy: he's the guy?  dipper: wendy, he's the guy!  unknown man: the guy?  dipper: i've got like a gillion questions! why did you write the journals? who was after you? why did you build this bunker?  unknown man: heh. my boy i'd love to discuss this in time. we have more pressing matters. (all begin to walk around the lab) it's one of my experiments, a shape shifter. able to take the form of anyone or anything it sees. it broke free from a cage of solid steel! i've gone half crazy trying to catch the creature alone. but now you're here! will you help me catch it? (lifts goggles)  dipper: (gasps in excitement)  cut to mabel and soos exploring the other room.  soos: sure are taking their time in there. (slips on lab coat, and picks up laptop) hey, do i look smarter with this coat and brief case? i feel like i look smarter...  mabel: (gasps) razzle dazzle! look at this tube-y thing! (pressing button on dashboard) frozen! unfrozen! frozen! unfrozen! what's this? experiment number 210: the shape shifter.  soos: the shape shifter? uh, dude? didn't dipper say there was a monster in there with them?  mabel: (gasps) i thought he was just joking!  soos: you know dipper's jokes are terrible!  mabel: dipper!!  cut back to dipper, wendy, and the unknown man, still in the lab.  unknown man: come in, come in! i apologize for the state of things! i don't get many non mole-people visitors. now the beast must have some weakness we can exploit. i just wish i had my research on me. but alas, i lost my journals so many years ago.  wendy: did you say journals?  dipper: dude! i found one of them! that's how i tracked you down here. (pulls out journal)  unknown man: what?! could it be? (takes journal from dipper) my boy! i can't express my gratitude! (flips through pages of the journal) oh yes, after all these years...   cut to mabel and soos running in to the other room, both are panting.  soos: wendy?! oh, it's so dark! how will we ever find them?  mabel: leave that to mabel! (presses light bulb on sweater)  soos: whoa, rad! although, isn't electric clothing kinda like a fire hazard?  mabel: no. it's a fun hazard. now let me light the way! (runs off with soos following behind)  soos: we're coming for you dudes!  cut back to wendy, dipper, and the unknown man, who is skimming through the pages of the journal.  unknown man: (to himself) yes, yes. it's all here.  dipper: (whispering to wendy, as she picks up a can of beans) wendy! isn't it amazing we're actually meeting the real author?  wendy: (gasps and bites lip. holding out the can to dipper. whispering:) dipper! look! (shows him a can of beans with a picture of ""the author"" on it)  dipper: (to man:) uhh, you know what? we should probably get going. can i have my journal back?  unknown man: (blinks eyes sideways and turns head all the way around. voice deepening:) you're not going anywhere. (crawls up wall and turns into ""true form"")  dipper and wendy: aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!  shape shifter: (laughs) how do you like my true form? go on, admit it, you like it!  dipper: you! what did you do to the real author?!  shape shifter: you'll likely never find out. that six-fingered nerd hasn't been himself in thirty years! but i thank you for bringing me his journal. he used to write it while i was in my cage. so many wonderful forms to take! (flipping through the journal, it transforms into the gremloblin, a gnome, and then the hide behind, laughing each time)  dipper: (whispering to wendy:) we've gotta get that journal back!  wendy: hey body snatcher! (picks up can of beans and throws at shape shifter) snatch this!  shape shifter: (dodges it, turns into a giant frog monster, and lashes its tongue out at wendy)  wendy: (holds up a piece of metal to block the tongue, making it drop the journal)  dipper: run! run! run!  dipper and wendy: (run through tunnels)  shape shifter: (chasing them while taking several forms, then turns into a giant rolly polly monster and chases them to a fork in the tunnels)  dipper: (throws his flashlight down one end and runs with wendy down the other end. they crash into soos and mabel)  all: (greet each other excitedly)  dipper: (to soos and mabel:) wait! how do we know they're not the shape shifter?  soos: maybe i am! mabel, inspect my shape! (pulls up shirt)  mabel: (pokes soos' stomach) poke!  soos: (laughs) do that again!  mabel: (pokes soos' stomach again) poke!  soos: (laughs once more) even better the second time!  dipper: it's definitely them. (gasps) oh my gosh, wendy, you're bleeding!  wendy: it's cool, it's cool. it's just blood man; don't freak out.  mabel: what happened?  wendy: we got attacked by the shape shifter. (taking off her shirt, and rips off a sleeve to cover the injury) he broke out of his cage, pretended to be the author, and wants dipper's journal.  dipper: imagine if he escapes to the town! he can transform into anything! we could never trust anyone ever again!  mabel: what do we do?!  wendy: well, he took us into his home, tricked us, and tried to destroy us. i say we return the favor.  cut to a different tunnel. the shape shifter returns to its human form.  shape shifter: dipper, my boy! come out! (momentarily loses its form) i must speak with you! (turns into a creature with six legs, claws, and a one-eyed head resembling a hand) reveal yourself, you single-formed human weakling! (slams its head into the ground)  mabel: (entering the room with dipper) oh boy, dipper. that book sure is full of some great monsters!  shape shifter: there you are! ooh, and a new one. (turns into mabel) should i be one... (turns into dipper) ...or the other? how about both!?

(armed with golf pencils, the dutchmen charge.)  lilliputtian pirate captain: (sarcastically:) ooh, i'm shiverin' in me timbers! get them! (the pirates swing off of the ship and run towards the others.)  lilliputtian head knight: long live the mini king!  the lilliputtians collide and start fighting in front of the twins.  dutch lilliputtian: (to a knight lilliputtian:) die, medieval scum! (jumps at the knight and they collide and fall backwards) ow!  the head pirate swings at a frenchman and falls into the lake. a duck picks up a dutchman and swallows him.  dipper: (laughs) these guys are a riot!  mabel: (laughing) guys, guys, calm down! your fighting is inadvertently adorable!  franz: (bruised and battered) adorable we are, hugeling, but our tale less so. every hole in the park thinks they're superior, from the cowboys in the east to the grimy miners of the south. if only there was some way to decide which side is best, with... maybe... an award, or, like a trophy, i dunno.  french lilliputtian: but franz, look! (points to mabel's sticker)  franz: the sticker. the sticker could decide!  french lilliputtian: it does say ""ze best"" on it!  lilliputtian head knight: decide for us, hugeling! choose which mini-kingdom to give a sticker to, and end our war!  the lilliputtians cheer.  mabel: uh, i don't know, guys. i'm not sure i wanna get involved in your weird mini-blood feud.  dipper: pst! mabel! this is perfect! these guys control the course! just tell them you'll give the sticker to whichever group does a better job of helping us win!  mabel: i'm not sure, dipper. i wanna beat pacifica, but doesn't this seem like... cheating?  dipper: pacifica's rich, mabel. she's cheating at life.  mabel: hmm...  dipper: (blows on a tiny trumpet) thanks, man. (returns it to a knight)  mabel: (standing on the castle) people of the eighteen holes! we're going to have a game of mini-golf! and whoever does the best job helping me win, gets the sticker!  lilliputtian pirate captain: it'll be us, lass. not these tulip-munchers!  franz: i will not be insulted by a man with no depth perception wearing earrings!  mabel: just remember, as long as you're helping me, no fighting.  the lilliputtians look at each other and smile. cut to the parking lot. soos and stan are in the car.  soos: dude, i'm cuttin' ws into all my shirts. gotta give the public what they want.  stan: well, those kids are taking their time. looks like it's gonna be a while. (turns on the radio. soos takes off his shirt to work on the neck. stan leans back in his seat and sighs. he closes his eyes, then looks over at soos, who, still shirtless, has reclined next to him.)  soos: sure are a lot of stars out tonight...  stan: (sits up.) well, this is gettin' weird. (leaves.)  preston northwest: (the northwest car pulls up.) but now remember, pacifica, winning is everything.  priscilla northwest: oh, oh, and also looks. winning and looks. (looks at self in mirror.)  pacifica: dad, i've been practicing for, like, a million hours, okay? i've got this. you'll stay and watch, right?  preston northwest: pacifica, darling, we have a party to go to. we'll just read about your victory in the paper.  pacifica: (gets out of car.) sergei! (sergei climbs out of the trunk and gets the luggage.)  preston northwest: oh, and whatever happens, just remember one thing. you're a northwest. don't lose. (slams the door and the car drives away.)  pacifica: (entering the park:) how much you wanna bet they're no-shows?  a succession of lights flashes on, revealing mabel and dipper.  mabel: looking for someone?  pacifica: waiting in the dark, not creepy at all. seriously though, i don't know why you bothered to come. unless you've got something up your sleeve.  mabel: oh, i guess you could say we've got a little something, right, right? (a lilliputtian pops out of her sleeve. she shoves it back in, and she and dipper laugh nervously.)  sergei: eighteen holes. standard rules. winner lives in glory, loser wallows in eternal shame. on your mark, get set, mini-golf!  at the cowboy hole. pacifica putts; the lilliputtians block her ball with a covered wagon. mabel putts, and the cowboys raise the grass to move her ball towards the hole. a cowboy shoots the ball, and it goes in. mabel gives a thumbs-up, and the cowboys return the gesture before turning to mock the pirates. at the pirate hole. mabel putts, and the pirates shoot her ball out of a cannon into the hole.  pacifica: out of my way! (putts. her ball shoots out the front and lands in her mouth.) are you serious?!  the pirates cheer, open a can of root beer, and raise their flag. at the miner hole. mabel putts, and the ball goes down into the mine.  dipper: ha, ha! miner hole. i wonder what cute, silly things are going on down there.  the ball rolls down a chute and two miners prepare to cart it into the mine.  prospector lilliputtian: stop! you can't go in there! there's been a gas leak! anyone who goes in there will die!!  the miners look scared, then part as big henry approaches.  big henry: i'll take it.  polly: noooo! (runs up to big henry.) don't go, big henry! we need you!  big henry: go home, polly.  big henry pushes the cart into the mine, leaving the others staring after him. sweating and breathing heavily, he trudges on through the seeping gas. cut to the outside, where mabel and pacifica are waiting silently for the ball to reemerge. pacifica checks her watch. back in the mine. big henry slaps himself.  big henry: come on, big henry. you can do this. (reaches the end of the track and, struggling, pushes the button to send up the ball. he collapses beside the track, gasping, and pulls out a picture of him and polly. his eyes fill with tears, smiles, and with a groan of satisfaction he dies peacefully.)  the ball rolls out of the mine and into the hole.  pacifica: what?! (throws her club, which sergei catches.) sergei! soda! now!  mabel: (lifts the lid of the mine hole.) okay, guys? that was bedonkulous!  dipper: hey, little hi-fives everyone, little hi-fives all around. (high-fives the miners with his finger) nice one... you did it... you're the man.  mabel: i don't wanna call it out early, but i think the miners might have one of these in their future! (points to sticker. the miners cheer.)  franz: (looking at them through a telescope from the windmill) are you kidding me?! after everything we've worked for?  dutch lilliputtian: calm yourself, franz. there may be another way to win the hugeling's favor. knock on wood. (they knock on their clogs.)  cut to pacifica and sergei. sergei gets a pitt cola from the vending machine.  pacifica: there's something going on, sergei. i can feel it.  sergei: maybe they have little people who control where the balls go.  pacifica: hoo, we gotta get you english lessons. i mean, think about it. i'm globally ranked. it's ridiculous that she's beating me. (a tiny figure darts behind a bush. pacifica drinks the soda and spits out the pit) ugh, pitt cola! i always forget about the pit. get me a different one, sergei. (a tiny hand taps her shoulder. she is grabbed and dragged into the bush.)  sergei: this is bad.  cut to dipper and mabel, tallying the scores.  dipper: i can't wait to see the look on pacifica's face when we win. i'm thinking it'll be like ""ugh."" (makes face.) you know how she does that? ""ugh.""  mabel: dipper, is it bad that i feel good about her feeling bad?  dipper: ah, just enjoy your victory, mabel. trust me, pacifica will be fine.  pacifica: (screams.) (she is tied in front of the windmill by the dutch lilliputtians.) what's going on here? let me go!  dipper and mabel: (screams. the lilliputtian peeps out of mabel's sleeve.)  lilliputtian: (screams.) what'd i miss?  pacifica: let me go, you creeps!  franz: welcome twins, welcome! i can tell you're loving this, right, right? no?  mabel: what are you guys doing?  dipper: this wasn't part of the deal, tiny dutchman!  franz: okay, so we saw you were favoring the miners, and we figured, what's better than beating pacifica? (blows raspberry) killing her, right?  pacifica: as if! i'm calling my parents. where's my phone?  the lilliputtians have taken it and are sending the message ""u r dumm!"" to someone named tiffany.  lilliputtian: hehe, send.  pacifica: hey, hey!  franz: so how about it, hugeling? who's da best now?  lilliputtian pirate captain: not so fast land lubbers! (the pirates reveal that they have captured sergei.) if you're going to play dirty, so are we. now give us the sticker, or he walks the plank!  french lilliputtian: no! give us ze sticker!  miner lilliputtians: the miners! give it to the miners!  the lilliputtians all clamor, pressuring mabel, until she screams-  mabel: enough! (the lilliputtians look at her. one peeks out of the duck's beak.)  mabel: you know what? no one gets the sticker!  french lilliputtian: sacre booo!  lilliputtians: (boo.)  mabel: no, no. nuh-uh. no booing- stop, no! no one gets the sticker cuz you're all being jerks! i mean, why can't you all just get along?  beat.  dutch lilliputtian: because we hate each other.  lilliputtian pirate captain: that's kind of how rivalries work, lass.  mabel: well then, maybe... maybe rivalries are dumb. maybe you don't settle them with petty competitions. maybe the only way to be ""da best"" is by ending the fighting and working together! (rips off the sticker and eats it angrily. the lilliputtians gasp and converse.)  dutch lilliputtian: it's all so clear.  franz: if we work together...  lilliputtian pirate captain: then we can cut open her belly and get the sticker! (all cheer and rush forward.)  french lilliputtian: get ze girl! slice her open!  mabel: uh, you guys aren't appreciating the lesson here!  a lever is pulled near pacifica, and she starts being pulled toward the whirring blades of the windmill. she screams.  dipper: we gotta get out of here!  mabel: i have to save pacifica first! (climbs a lamp post, followed by the swarm of lilliputtians. she swings along a chain of lights and lands by the windmill, evading the golf pencil spears thrown by the crowd.)  sergei: (about to fall off the plank:) ah, mister dipper! нет, нет! (pronounced as ""niet, niet!""; russian for ""no, no!"")  dipper: don't freak out, man! the water's shallow! there's literally no way to drown!  sergei: (falls in face first.)  dipper: seriously?  pacifica: (as mabel unties her:) ugh, took you long enough, and watch the earrings. they're worth more than your house.  mabel: you know, on second thought, maybe i won't untie you.  pacifica: untie me! untie me!  mabel: that's what i thought. (pulls pacifica free and grabs a golf club.)  lilliputtian pirate captain: we have you at miniature pencil point! there's no way around us!  mabel: you ready to putt?  pacifica: way ahead of you. (grabs her club and they start swinging at the lilliputtians.) you know, you're actually not that terrible. a little rusty, but-  mabel: just shut up and putt!  the lilliputtians are hit out of the way. dipper and sergei show up driving a golf cart.  dipper: get on, get on!  mabel: gun it! (they drive away.)  lilliputtian pirate captain: don't let them escape!  the golf cart heads for the exit. the knights cut a string, releasing a pair of swinging axes in front of the gate. dipper hits the gas and they zoom through. they go around a loop-de-loop and sergei falls off.  sergei: sergei overboard!  pacifica: i'll get a new one.  dipper: they're shutting us in! (lilliputtians poke holes through the cart. mabel climbs on the roof.)  franz: don't even think about it. you call yourself a golfer? without us, that club is useless in your hands!  mabel: oh yeah? what's ten minus six?  franz: ten minu- what- hang on...  mabel: four! (hits franz into the bonus hole. it glows and shoots up a column of lava, which the golf cart rides on. they skid through the gates and stop in the parking lot, where the cart falls apart. pencils and an ax poke through the gate.)  franz: stay out, you dumb hugelings! (golf balls are tossed over the wall.)  pacifica: what did you say, you little trolls? i will sue you! i will sue you and i will own you! (to the twins:) you two! i don't know what you did or what's going on, but if you think just because you saved my life i—  mabel: (hands her a sticker that says ""i a-paw-logize"") i'm sorry, pacifica. we shouldn't have cheated. you totally would have beat me, fair and square.  pacifica: (frowns and sticks on the sticker) you're just lucky this sticker looks fantastic on me.  stan and soos pull up. dipper and mabel get in. looking at pacifica standing alone in the parking lot, dipper shakes his head.  mabel: hey! your parents aren't here. want a ride home?  pacifica: ugh, please. as if i'd ride in your—  lightning flashes and thunder is heard. cut to inside the car. pacifica is squished between dipper and mabel in the backseat. stan and soos are singing the ""driving song"". pacifica's glove rests on a sticky smudge.  mabel: hey, i found two tacos! (eats one)  pacifica: you're allowed to eat in the car?  mabel: yeah! the car is where secret surprise snacks happen! want one?  pacifica: oh, i'm not supposed to take handouts.  mabel: handouts? it's called sharing! you do know what sharing is, right?  pacifica: sha-shaawing?  mabel: just take it.  they pull up to pacifica's house. she gets out.  pacifica: thanks for the ride, or whatever. oh, and mabel? um, i can't believe i'm saying this, but i had fun. and tell your servant i like his w-neck!  soos: yes! (the flap falls down.)  dipper: so are you guys, like, cool now?  mabel: i think we made some progress. the important thing to remember is that at the end of the day, she's just an ordinary kid like us. (the gates swing open to reveal the northwest mansion, complete with fountains and peacocks. fireworks go off.)  dipper: should have charged her for that taco.  mabel: agreed!  soos: hey, got any more of those surprise tacos? (they all laugh. franz is hiding on the rear license plate)  franz: laugh now, hugelings, but franz will have his day. franz will— (falls off and lands upside-down on the side of the road) ah, help! sand trap, ow, ow!  cut to credits.  lilliputtians: (singing:) ""we control the balls! we control the balls! from birmingham to montreal, we control the balls!""  miner lilliputtian: hey guys, i figured it out! we control the balls!  pirate lilliputtian: now he gets it!  miner lilliputtian: oh, you guys!  lilliputtians: (laugh, then form a kick-line, singing:) ""our lives are filled with nonstop fun! well there's nothing like a hole in one! (strike a final pose)  sergei: (claps.) can i go now?  miner lilliputtian: never!  <b>credits</b>: nlmxqwwn iiz lzfnf (remember big henry decoded from vigenère. the key is whatevs.) </td></tr>, <th><b>credits</b> </th>, <tr> <th style=""text-align: center;

(whispering:) it's for love, dipper.  dipper: all right, okay-  mabel: (hugging him) yes! thank you!! this guy! he's number one!!!  dipper: okay, okay, okay, shhhh...(dipper and mabel are leaving the library) i can't wait to get to the bottom of this laptop. we're close to something big here; i can feel it...  bill's shadow follows them while walking out of the library. montage of dipper and mabel preparing for the opera and dipper trying to figure out the password. cuts to everyone (mabel, dipper, soos, wendy, and waddles) in the living room, working on the puppets.  mabel: alright. this is gonna be called glove story: a sock opera. just to warn you, people's eyes will get wet. cause they'll be crying. from laughter! from how tragic it is.  dipper: (trying to rip sock puppets that are glued to his face) yeah, um. that's sounds great. (coughs up pom-poms)  wendy corduroy: come on, dipper, you gotta roll with mabel's craziness. it's what makes life worth living.  mabel: (singing:) puppet boy, puppet boy, you're the boy i-  everyone: loooooovvvvveeee! (waddles squeals along)  stan pines: (starts to walk in) not even gonna ask.  cut to the evening with mabel putting puppets around her bed.  mabel: goodnight, my babies. (takes a gabe puppet and makes it kiss the mabel puppet) mwop mwop mwop mwop. mwah! soon, gabe benson-  computer beeps.  dipper: ugh, wrong password, wrong, wrong! ugh! (collapses)  mabel: don't stay up all night, dipper. last time you got this sleep-deprived you tried to eat your own shirt.  dipper: (sucking on shirt, then spits it out) pleh. just a few more tries. (cut to him on the roof, typing and making the computer beep) ugh, i can't take that sound anymore. (pounding on computer) i. hate. you. sound. (yawns) there has to be some shortcut or clue. who would know about secret codes?  wind blows. an eye creeps around the moon, and bricks form around it to reveal bill. color vanishes from the world.  bill cipher: i think i know a guy.  commercial break  bill cipher: well, well, well. you're awfully persistent, pine tree. hats off to you! (takes his hat off, tilting the world sideways)  dipper: (falling off roof) aa! aaa! aaa! aaaaaaa! (falls back on) you again!  bill: did you miss me? admit it, you missed me.  dipper: hardly. you worked with gideon! you tried to destroy my uncle's mind!  bill: it was just a job, kid! no hard feelings! i've been keeping an (becomes bigger and voice becomes lower:) eye on you (normal size and voice:) since then, and i must say i'm impressed!  dipper: really?  bill: you deserve a prize! here, have a head that's always screaming! (claps and a screaming head appears)  screaming head: aah! aah! aah!...  dipper: (shocked) ah!  bill: (snaps and the head disappears layer by layer) hahaha... the point is, i like you. how's about you let me give you a hint, huh? i only ask for a small - (voice gets low and hand and eye light on fire:) favor (normal:) - in return.  dipper: i'd never do a favor for you! don't forget who defeated you last time!  bill: (rising out of the roof behind him) right, you ""defeated me"". well if you ever change your mind (pretends to grab dipper's brain) i'll be here for you, ready to make a deeaaall. (three slots appear spinning on his chest. they stop at a pine tree symbol) hey, wanna hear my impression of you in about three seconds? aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!  dipper: (wakes up) aaaaaaaaaaaah!!  cut to stan in kitchen.  mabel: (waving the stan puppet in stan's face:) hey, i'm puppet staaaannn!  stan: still ignoring this.  dipper: (walks in and yawns) hey mabel. (yawns)  stan: woah, bag check for dipper's eyes. ha ha! nobody?  mabel: dipper, i told you to get some sleep last night! here, wake up with some mabel juice. (holds blender full of red liquid with various objects floating around) it has plastic dinosaurs in it!  stan: it's like if coffee and nightmares had a baby!  dipper: (pushing mabel into living room) mabel, listen, last night i had a dream with bill in it.  mabel: wait, hold up, the triangle guy? (holding fingers around her eye to make a triangle)  dipper: he said he'd give me the code to the laptop if i gave him something. like i'd actually trust bill, right?  mabel: don't worry, bro. today's the day that the mystery twins are back in action. i'll help you crack that code. i've just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew.  dipper: production crew?  cut to candy and grenda outside the mystery shack covered in socks.  candy chiu: we read the script. very emotional.  grenda: i cried like eight times.  gabe: hey ladies. (skates up to them)  mabel: gabe!  gabe: i was just bladin' by. helps me dry out my ponytail after a shower. (takes off helmet and shakes hair) ah, ah.  grenda: hubbity-hubbuty.  candy: (whispering) 매이블이 한테 개이브을 훔쳐하겠다! (revised romanization: ""maeibeur'i hante gaeibeu'eul humchyeohagetda."" subtitled: ""i must steal him away from mabel."")  mabel: it's so great to see you! i was just working on the world's greatest puppet show. it has puppets!  gabe: your passion is so refreshing, mabel. unlike the girl from last night's puppet show. single-stich on one puppet, and cross-stitch on the other? i was like, ""uh-uh!""  mabel: cross-huh?  gabe: naturally i deleted her off my cell phone contacts list.  mabel: naturally! hahahaha!  gabe: i know you won't let me down. based on what you said the other day, you must be a puppet expert.  grenda: you know, gabe, you look pretty sweaty. you should really take your shirt off. right? aren't we all thinking that?  gabe: later, ladies. (skates off)  mabel: gwaaa!! we gotta up our game, girls! did you hear that thing he said about the stitches?!  grenda: don't worry, mabel, your crew can handle it! (holds up puppet of herself, but then rips it) oops.  candy: how many eyes does a face have again? (holds up sock covered in googly eyes)  soos: (trying to keep a mountain of stuff on the car) i got it, i got it, (falls) ah! i'm not okay!  mabel: aaa! okay, i'm back on fabrication. (running) get me my lint roller!  dipper: (grabs her) whoa, whoa! hey, you just said you were going to help me!  mabel: dipper! this sock crisis just bumped up to code argyle! the laptop can wait!  dipper: mabel, do you seriously think that your random crush of the week is more important than uncovering the mysteries of this town? you're obsessed!  mabel: i'm obsessed? look at you! you look like a vampire! and not the hot kind!  dipper: (rubs eyes) but you said you were going to help me today!  mabel: (sock:) oh, i can help you. with tickles! (tickles him)  dipper: ha! ha! ha! (punches her arm and candy and grenda laugh) okay, fine! you know what? i'll do it on my own! (in attic, typing) passwords. passwords. mabel. is. useless. (yawns) oh, man...  computer: too many failed entries. initiate data erase in five minutes.  dipper: no! noonono! i'm gonna lose everything?! i only have one more try?!  everything turns black and white and bill appears.  bill: well, well, well. someone's looking desperate.  dipper: i thought i told you to leave me alone.  bill: i can help you, kid. (hand lights on fire) you just need to hear out my demands.  dipper: (looking at computer, which is at 4 minutes now) uh, what crazy thing do you want anyway? to eat my soul? to rip out my teeth? are you gonna replace my eyes with baby heads or something?  bill: yeesh, kid, relax. all i want is a puppet!  dipper: a puppet? what are you playing at?  bill: everyone loves puppets. and it looks to me that you've got a surplus.  dipper: i don't know, man. mabel worked really hard on these.  bill: seems to me one little puppet is a small price to pay to learn all the secrets of the universe. (his voice echoes on the last word) besides, what's your sister done for you, lately? how many times have you sacrificed for her, huh? and when has she ever returned the favor? (flashes back to scenes from ""tourist trapped,"" ""the time traveler's pig,"" and ""the deep end"").  dipper: (looks at mabel playing outside with her friends, and the computer, which now has 30 seconds on the clock)  bill: (eye becomes a clock) tick tock, kid. (reaches for him and hand lights on fire)  dipper: uh, just one puppet? fine! (shakes hand) so what puppet are you gonna pick, anyway?  bill: hmm, let's see. eenie meenie mynie... (voice gets low and echoes:) you. (tears dipper from his body)  dipper: huh? (floating transparently. puts his hand through his stomach) this can't be happening! what did you do to my body?!  bill: (in dipper's body, gets up) sorry, kid but you're my puppet, now! aahahaha! (throws computer to floor and steps on it) ahahaha!  dipper: oh my gosh, this can't be happening. this can't be happening!  bill: (stumbles around, cackling. he stops in front of a mirror while a horrified dipper watches.) man, it has been so long since i've inhabited a body. (slaps himself in the face) woo! (slaps the other cheek) woo! haha! pain is hilarious!! and two eyes? this thing's deluxe! (examines his eyes and pulls down his lip to look inside his mouth.)  dipper: i don't understand! why are you doing this?! i thought we had a deal!  bill: look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers. i've got big plans comin' and i don't need you gettin' in my way. destroying that laptop was a cinch. now i just need to destroy your journal. race ya to the bottom of the stairs! (tips backward and tumbles down the stairs.)  dipper: (gasps. he zooms down through the floor and lands in the living room. he steadies himself and flies through the wall into the hall.) hey!  bill: (in the kitchen, taking a can of pitt cola from the fridge.) human soda! i'm gonna drink it like a person! (he pours it into his mouth and over his face, laughing.) where do you keep that journal anyway? (opens a drawer and reaches in. he slams the drawer on his arm repeatedly.) it's gotta be around here somewhere. (continues slamming drawer, occasionally wincing) boy, these arms are durable.  dipper: i've hidden it! (bill strokes his chin thoughtfully, forks stuck in his arm.) somewhere you'll never find it in a million years!  mabel: hey dipper! (from the doorway) i borrowed your journal to use as a prop in the show i hope you don't mind i'm gonna go before you process this sentence okay byee!! (runs off)  bill: (he looks at dipper, then grins) sure, sounds great, sister! i'll see you at the show!  dipper: wait! no, mabel, don't listen to him! that's not me! (he flies after mabel. mabel gets in grunkle stan's car.) you've gotta hear me! (he flies in front of the car.) no, no! wait! stop! (the car drives through him.)  bill: heh! welcome to the mindscape, kid! without a vessel to possess, you're basically a ghost!  soos ramirez: oh, hey dipper! there you are!  wendy: what up, dude?  dipper: soos! wendy! help me! (he waves his arms and flies through soos.)  soos: (to bill:) we're heading to the theater.  wendy: need a ride, dipper?  bill: oho, anything for you, red! (he gets in the car)  dipper: i'm gonna stop you, bill! i'm gonna find that journal before you do and i'm gonna stop you!!  bill: but how can you stop me, (slowly turns to dipper) if you don't exist? (he laughs maniacally as the window rolls up, showing dipper's horrified expression. the car drives off, and dipper is left staring after it.)  cut to the outside of the theatre time theater. dipper flies out of a nearby building.  dipper: bill? bill! i gotta get my body back before he does something crazy with it. (he flies into the theater.)  bill: aw, nothing like the theater, huh toots? (he is sitting with an arm around wendy and soos.) hey soos, wanna hear the exact time and date of your death?  soos: heheh, okay!  mabel: hey guys! you all made it!   stan: are you kidding me? i would never miss... whatever this is.  bill: by the by, mabel, where'd you put my journal again?  mabel: i used it as a prop for the big wedding scene! i still need a reverend, though.  bill: hey, what if i play the reverend? i mean, someone's gotta hold that journal, right?  mabel: right! let's go! (runs off with bill)  dipper: oh, no! wait! mabel! (he flies after and follows them backstage.)  mabel peeks through the curtain. gabe is sitting down with his puppets. the lights flicker.  grenda: the show is about to begin! please turn off your cell phones! unless you're texting me, cuties!  the house lights dim, and, to applause, the curtain opens. the set is a glittery and colorful mystery shack. a light illuminates candy, standing at a keyboard, dressed as david bowie.  candy: gather round, and let us sing, about a girl who had almost everything.  she is rolled off the stage. a dipper puppet pops out of a window and sings.  mabel: (as puppet dipper:) look, it's mabel! (puppet mabel pops up.) (as puppet mabel:) hi there! (as puppet soos:) did you say stable? (as puppet stan:) no, he said mabel! (as puppet mabel:) okay, hit it, boys!! (the puppets form a line and sing.) (singing as puppets:) who's that girl with the pig and the braces? she puts smiles on everyone's faces! (gabe smiles and nods along) when she's around, you're never bored! (as puppet mayor:) i am a mayor, and here's an award! (singing as puppet mabel:) thank you, mayor, it's true i'm great. but the perfect girl needs the perfect maaaate... (gabe puppet is revealed.) (as puppet gabe:) hey, what's up, i'm gabe. (as puppet mabel:) bwaaaa? (heart glasses are layered over eyes)   bill: (grenda is standing backstage. bill, dressed in vicarage clothing, walks up behind her) so, hey, grendo! where's that book prop i'm using for the wedding scene?  grenda: it's up in the wedding cake. but that doesn't come down until act 3. so hold your horses!  bill: (backing away) oh, i'll hold my horses. i'll hold them... you monster.  dipper: (flies up to grenda) hey! listen! have you seen mabel? (grenda doesn't see him.) what did bill say? i can't be heard without a vessel? where would i find a- (notices a pile of puppets and grins)  mabel: (as puppet mabel:) finally, we're together. (as puppet gabe:) i'm sorry, mabel, but i have to go fight. in the war! (a helmet lands on his head. he yells and runs off into a ravaged, flaming background. with a roar, a gigantic many-tentacled monster appears. lasers flash, fog rolls in, and gunshots are heard.) (as puppet mabel:) i'll wait for you, gabe! i'll wait for you!! (happy music plays and the curtain closes. the audience cheers.)   grenda: our intermission has begun! mill about! (the audience does.)  mabel: (in her dressing room) whew, okay, you can do this, mabel. only 36 more musical numbers. (she drinks from the water fountain. the dipper puppet slowly rises, floating beside mabel.)  dipper: pst, mabel! (she notices the dipper puppet talking and does a spit take.)  mabel: aah! it's come to life! the puppetbooks didn't warn me about this! (she throws a fork at it.)  dipper: mabel, it's me, dipper! you need to help me!  mabel: wait, what, dipper?! but you're... so much more of a sock than usual!  dipper: mabel, you have to listen. bill tricked me! he stole my body and now he's after the journal! you have to find the journal before bill destroys it. it's the only hope to get me back in my body!  mabel: but my cue's coming up any minute! (there is a knock on the door and gabe enters with flowers.)  gabe: hey, mabel, do you have a moment?  mabel: gabe! (she grabs the puppet floating beside her and tucks it behind her back, laughing nervously. dipper struggles to free his hand.)  dipper: ow! mabel!  gabe: mabel, it's clear to me now that you really love puppets. i mean, you went whole hog. and if you stick the ending, well, maybe later you could join me for a biscotti?  mabel: you drive a biscotti? (the lights flick on and off)  gabe: i'll be waiting. (he leaves.)  mabel: did you hear that? he loves it! this play has to be flawless. can't we wait until after the show?  dipper: mabel! you want me to be a sock puppet forever?! (the puppet's arms flail)  mabel: (laughs) i'm sorry, it- it looks funny when you're mad.  dipper: (grunting)  mabel: okay, okay, okay, just take over for me till i get back with the book. little puppet face!  cut to the stage. dipper is providing the voices for the puppets.  dipper: (as puppet mabel:) gabe! you're back from the war! (as puppet gabe:) yes i am! wanna kiss and sing at the same time? (as puppet mabel:) okay! (he makes kissing sound effects as the puppets kiss.) (to himself:) seriously?   the audience applauds. mabel climbs the catwalk and runs over to where the giant cake is hanging. the journal sits inside. mabel climbs over the edge and reaches for the journal.  mabel: come on, come on! (falls into the cake and it plummets down. just before it hits the stage, it is pulled back up.)  dipper: (as mabel:) i hope this kiss never ends!  mabel: (sighs) come on, come on now, there must be a way to get dipper's body back!  bill: oho, but why would you want to do that? (mabel looks up to see bill pulling the cake up, with lights shining behind his grinning face.)  mabel: bill dipper! bipper.  bill: shh! you wouldn't want to ruin the show... whoops! (he briefly releases the cake, sending mabel plummeting.) it's slipping! how's about you hand that book over?  mabel: no way! this is dipper's! i'd never give it away!  bill: hmm, you didn't seem to have a problem taking it for your own play, ditching him when he needed you. so come to your senses. give me the book or your play is ruined. (mabel sighs and begins to hand over the journal.) there it is. i mean, who would sacrifice everything they've worked for just for their dumb sibling?  mabel: dipper would.  bill: huh? (mabel pulls him into the cake and they fall to the stage.)  dipper: (as puppet stan:) i'm giving you away. you are a woman now. waddles, the rings! (waddles squeals) wait, what? (dipper looks up to see the falling cake.)  oh no. (the cakes crashes to the floor. mabel and bill tumble out, grappling over the journal. lasers and fog go off.)  mabel: get out of my brother's body, you evil triangle!  stan: (gets out camera) whoa! children fighting! i can sell this.  mabel: (hits bill in the face with the journal and runs away.)  bill: you can't stop me! i'm a being of pure energy with no weakness! (lunges at mabel.)  mabel: true, but you're in dipper's body. and i know all his weaknesses!  bill: whaddya mean his- (mabel tickles him)  mabel: tickle, tickle!  bill: (laughs and falls on the floor.) aah! body spasms! what are these?  mabel: a little note about the human body- you haven't slept for 24 hours! (she runs around the stage, bill chasing her) also, i got a full night's sleep and i'm on four mega-shots of mabel juice!  bill: (his face drooping) ah! what is this feeling? (wheezing) my body is burning! i can't move these stupid noodle legs! curse you, useless flesh sticks! body...shutting down... must...scratch... mosquito bites...  dipper and mabel watch as bill stumbles around, then he collapses. bill shoots out of dipper's body and the world turns black and white.  bill: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.. hey! (dipper flies back into his body and opens his eyes.)  dipper: hey! yes! i'm in my own body! and it's... just as underwhelming as i remember. (he stands and grips his back in pain.) ooh, everything hurts.  bill: (cackling. the twins look over to see the dipper puppet talking.) this isn't the last you'll hear of me! big things are coming! you can't stop me!  mabel: i'm sorry, gabe.  she pushes the ""big finish"" button. bill is revealed to be on a pile of pyrotechnics, which explodes, sending fireworks shooting into the audience and blowing up the box of puppets. in slow motion, the grunkle stan puppet arcs through the air, aflame, as gabe, amid falling puppets, looks on in shock. ""ave maria"" plays mournfully.  the rest of the fireworks go off in a cacophonous boom, and dipper gleefully stomps on the dipper puppet. as the smoke clears from the smoldering set, the twins turn to the audience. some scaffolding crashes to the floor behind them.  mabel: don't worry. i've seen enough movies to know this is the part where the audience thinks it was all part of the show and loves it. cue applause!  the audience stares at them and starts to boo. they get up and leave the theater, grumbling about how they almost died. gabe stands, frowning.  mabel: gabe! stick around for the wrap party? we've got mini-quiches!  gabe: don't speak to me, mabel. you've made a mockery of my art form. let's go, my loves. (he walks away, kissing the puppets.)  dipper: did he just make out with his puppets?  mabel: i might've dodged a bullet there.  candy:  (running after him) 개이브이 잠깐! 캔디 나 아직도 널 사랑해! (revised romanization: ""gaeibeu'i jamkkan! kaendi na ajikdo neol saranghae!"" subtitled: ""wait, gabe! candy still loves you!"")   dipper: oof. mabel, i'm sorry about all this. it's my fault your puppets got ruined.  mabel: well, one of them survived. (pulls out the mabel puppet.) and she has something to say to you. (as puppet) i'm sorry, dipper. i spent all week obsessing over a dumb guy. but the dumb guy i should have cared about was you! bap! (nudges dipper's face.) mystery twins?  dipper: mystery twins. (they fist bump. dipper gasps in pain.) ow! what'd bill do to my hand? ahh!  mabel: nothing a little sleep can't fix. (they walk offstage.) come on, bro bro, let's go home.  dipper: seriously, i need to go to the hospital.  end credits. real-life dipper and mabel puppets.  mabel puppet: hey dipper, what did one sock puppet say to the other sock puppet?  dipper puppet: i don't know mabel, what?  mabel puppet: you look like you could use a hand! (she laughs. dipper puppet faces away annoyed. the curtain closes. puppet stan and old man mcgucket are sitting in a theater booth)  mcgucket puppet: that joke was really something!  stan puppet: yeah, something terrible! (laugh)  mabel wakes up with a scream. she turns the mabel puppet away from her bed and goes back to sleep."

(hears timer go off) oh, highlights are done! (sets down his controller, leans over and begins taking foil out of his grandmother's hair) you're gonna make all the other grandmas at the bingo hall so jealous!  abuelita: just a minute, m'ijo, look at this.

(leans back in couch) i could totally get a date in a week. totally. piece of cake.  game voice: (game over text appears on tv screen) you're dead!  soos: i'm dead.  cut to theme song.  a child is seen walking through the mystery shack gift shop, flipping a coin and licking a lollipop.  stan: (jumps out from behind rack of postcards) hello!  child: (screams)  stan: please, don't let my horrible elderly face frighten you. (reaches over to sheet and pulls it away to reveal goldie) don't you want to use that nickel to get a nugget from old goldie?  child: uuuuhhh...  stan: watch this! (inserts nickel into slot in goldie)  goldie's arm moves up and his hat raises. the arm moves down, but both of his eyes fall out while grease and smoke come out and he starts to scream. child runs away crying.  wendy: okay, seriously, mr. pines. it's time to throw that thing out. its face reminds everybody of the inevitability of death.  stan: what?! sure, he's a little rusty around the edges, but old goldie is a classic show-stopper, like me. huh? (hand slips on grease and lands in goldie's mouth. goldie holds onto his arm while he flails it around.) aaaah! kill it! kiiilll iiiittt!  cut to soos hanging up a shirt in the gift shop.  soos: (turns head and notices a woman checking out a snowglobe) ah! a hwoman!

(pulls shirts back to reveal soos) what was that all about?  soos: i-i think i was flirting, but i'm not sure.  mabel: (pops out of barrel of keychains) did someone say flirting?!  soos: well, i kinda promised my grandma i'd get a date by the end of the week, but i've never actually been on a date before. (grabs out-of-order sign off of vending machine) you belong on me, out-of-order sign.

25|gravity falls|Little Gift Shop of Horrors|October 4, 2014|"open to shot of the mystery shack at night. a person (we see the scene through its point of view) walks up to the door. stan answers it.  stan pines: well, hello there, traveler. i see your car broke down on this lonesome country road. a place so remote, that no one can hear your screams!  traveler: (backs away)  stan: pretend i didn't say that. come in, come in, but be warned: if you enter, you may be subjected to my tales... tales designed to sell my merchandise!  red bolded text appears, which reads ""tales designed to sell my merchandise.""  stan: (laughs maniacally) sorry, i was thinking of somethin' funny i heard earlier.  cut to the theme song.  stan: (lights lantern) you've come to the mystery shack after hours. a time when the most cursed objects are for sale! like that thing! there... (gestures to lump of random body parts that are groaning) nope? not a fan? too many orifices? alright, i can tell what you're looking for is this (pulls hand out of a chest) disembodied hand! why is it so expensive? well, that's quite a tale. and it's called hands off! no seriously, hands off (takes a glowing reptilian eye from person) that's not for sale. alright, hands off!! (cut to ""hands off"" title screen. cut to stan with dipper and mabel at a swap meet)  mabel pines: swap meet, swap meet, swap meet! look at all these priceless treasures! bobbly heads! (runs over to bobbly heads and flicks them) they agree with everything i say.  dipper pines: (putting on glasses) professor glasses! they make me look like a genius! (turns around and crashes into the glasses rack)  stan: (looking at watches) look at these faux-gold beauties! they're mob boss quality! (sees hand witch and turns to dipper and mabel) okay, kids. prepare to watch the delicate art of the deal. hey hagface! how much for the junk watches?  hand witch: they are not for sale! not for you, stan pines! the wind whispers your name!  tyler cutebiker: (to chimes:) shush, you guys!  stan: alright, i get it, you're creepy. anyway, less talky, more watchy. (puts down money and takes a watch)  hand witch: (grabs his arm) get your hands off my waaatchh!!  stan: aah! (pulls away) yeesh! freak show! (he and the twins walk away)  mabel: wow. someone needs to work on their social skills.  stan: and their observation skills. (shows them his wrist, which has the watch on it) boom! good job, heisting hands. (kisses them)  dipper: grunkle stan, are you seriously shoplifting from a witch? that sounded like a curse.  stan: (sarcastically:) that sounded like a curse! (yelling:) hey, anyone want to buy a wet blanket? we got a wet blanket for sale!  all except dipper: (laugh)  cut to toby determined at the wet blanket booth.  toby determined: i can't survive in this market...  cut to mystery shack. stan is in the bathroom.  stan: hah! curse? yeah, right. (sees himself in the mirror) aah! wait, is this curse-ugly or just normal ugly? heh. looks like i got off scot-free. (holds up arms, but he has no hands. cut to kitchen. stan is bringing the kids a pan, with oven mitts over his arms) alright kiddos, breakfast time. prepare your mouths for- (drops pan and mitts slip off)  mabel: (screams) no hands! grunkle stan! what happened to your hands??  stan: so i might have got cursed a little. but the watch looks nice, right?  hand witch: (appearing in the watch) foolish man! thieving hands find wicked face! you must return what isn't yours...  stan: (puts mitt back on with his mouth, muffling her speech) that's better.  dipper: i told you, grunkle stan. you gotta give that watch back and apologize.  stan: what? that old crone should apologize to me for denying my right to buy cheap junk. i don't need hands. i've got self-respect! (tries to pick up coffee but drops it. he slaps the fork, which flings bacon at his face) mabel, sweetie, will you make your uncle some hands?  mabel: (putting plastic cups with forks taped to them on stan's arms and singing:) lalala...hands makeover! (puts glitter on them) say hello to you new hands! in quotes.  stan: nice work, kid! (pats her on the head but pulls out some of her hair) see, hands are overrated. i'm ready to take on the day. (waves as lazy susan walks by) ma'am.  lazy susan: (screams)  cut to stan at bowling alley.  stan: (tries to throw a ball but trips the woman behind him, who throws up a bowling ball, which crashes a tv)  cut to stan at a market.  jimmy: hey, mr. pines. should we play ""toss me a dozen eggs"" like we always do?  stan: no, jimmy, wait, not today!  jimmy: (throws eggs)  stan: not todaaay! (gets pelted by eggs; to dipper and mabel:) let's find that witch.  cut to the family at a cave.  mabel: according to the swap meet pamphlet, the hand witch lives in a horrible hand witch lair, on hand witch mountain.  stan: stop saying hand witch.  they enter the cave. a hand taps mabel.  mabel: grunkle stan, did you just tap my shoulder?  stan: kid, i can't tap anything.  hands poke dipper.  dipper: guys, can you stop tapping both my shoulders?  stan: (shines flashlight at cave roof, revealing that it is covered in hands.)  all: (scream)  hands attack them.  stan: hands! lots of hands!  dipper: (punches several hands before one grabs his face)  hands are slapping stan.  mabel: (plays rock paper scissors with two of the hands. they win and chase her)  hand witch: (laughs) look at this... touching scene! up top! (high fives a hand) you guys... you guys get me.  stan: alright, you horrible wench. you got me. stealing is wrong, et cetera. (shakes watch off) take it. now can i have my hands back? i have a certain gesture i'd like to share with you.  hand witch: alas, your hands cannot be gotten so easily. the spirits say... ummm... that the curse can only be broken, by a kissss...  dipper, mabel, and stan: what?  stan: (sighs and gets up) it's alright, kids. just look away. (kisses her hand)  hand witch: a kiss on the liiiippss!!!  stan: what? forget it! i'm not kissing any of that mess! i don't need my hands that bad!  dipper: yeah, you're just making stuff up now.  stan: let's go, kids. (starts to leave)  hand witch: no, wait don't go! ehh- you're right, you're right. i-i-i was just making all of that stuff up. i-i was just trying to get something going, you know? it's so hard to meet people these days... (snaps fingers and hands let kids go and braid mabel's hair)  dipper: so this was all just a ploy to get a date?  hand witch: i'm desperate, okay? but every time i bring someone back here without keeping their hands hostage, they just run away.  stan: well, yeah, look at this horror show! it's creepy even for a cave.  mabel: you just need to redecorate! for example: (grabs a bunch of hands) a handalabra!  hand witch: oooh! the hand witch likes.  mabel: then watch me work. (throws hands) home makeover!  montage of ""home makeover.""  mabel: redecorate! brand new you! shake it around! you gotta do it to make it work! (montage ends. everyone is standing outside.) okay, time to take a look at your fantastic new cave.  hand witch: (hands come off her eyes)  mabel: men will definitely tolerate you, now. and i left a book of pick up lines on the end table.  hand witch: aaaaagh! oh my goodness, i can't believe this is the same cave, oh my goodness. i just can't find the words...  stan: how about ""here's your hands back?""  hand witch: oh, right! (hands come out of her hair and crawl around stan before reattaching)  stan: shakey! scratchy! i've missed you, old rascals. you're all right, sister.  hand witch: will you be my boyfriend now?  stan: nope. never. (while walking away from the cave) well. i learned nothing.  hand witch: (sighs) back to my crippling loneliness.  man: (climbs up to hand witch's cave) hey. i'm lost in these mountains. can i crash here for the night?  hand witch: please. come in. (grabs pick-up lines book, clears throat and reads from it:) girl, are those space pants? because your butt looks out of this world!  man: wow. thanks for noticing.  hand witch: yes!  we are back in the mystery shack at night.  stan: alright, i get it. you don't want the hand. (throws the hand back)  the hand crawls around before leaving the room.  stan: you're a savvy customer. but perhaps you'd be interested in buying... (searching his pockets, then sees waddles and grabs him) this magic pig! sure, he doesn't look magic, but there's a very interesting story i'm about to make up about him. and it's called: ""abaconings!""  abaconings title card appears. cut to dipper in the attic.  dipper: (looking at box) the ""what-the-heck-ahedron. solve this puzzle and your photo could get on this box."" (turns the box around to show a picture of a boy holding up the puzzle and getting kissed by a girl in a swimsuit) woah. that's false advertising i can get behind. (takes puzzle out of box and turns it around. it beeps. he turns it some more) come on... (it beeps again) ugh!  mabel: (into tape recording:) ooo! that's a bummer! this is may may and the hogg! coming at you on the am!  waddles: eee!  mabel: woah! not sure we can say that on the air! don't touch that dial, truckers! cause the hogg just ate it. (presses sound effects board, making a honking sound three times and then a fart sound.)  dipper: mabel, could you knock it off? i'm trying to solve this intelligence puzzle but it seems impossible. (it beeps)  mabel: maybe you're just not smart enough.  dipper: ...we'll see about that. (cut to him reading journal 3:) ""buried near the falls is the legendary percepshroom. to increase brainpower, grind it up and apply to forehead overnight"" (does as the instructions state; to what-the-heck-ahedron:) tomorrow, i own you!  waddles: (gets up and eats all of the percepshroom, including that on dipper's forehead. he looks at all of the books on the table)  the next morning  dipper: (gets up) ha-ha! i feel smarter already! the digits of pi are three point one... uh...  waddles: (through machine:) four, one, five, nine, two, six, et cetera.  dipper: what? who said that? mabel?  mabel: huh! dipper, look!  waddles: (drives into the room on a board tied to a monster truck) greetings, friends, it is i, waddles, the pig.  dipper: what?!  mabel: waddles! what happened to you? have you been possessed by the spirit of a nerd!?  waddles: (drives closer) i understand that my transformation may be vexing, but i have prepared a presentation- (bumps into computer, knocking it over) forgive me. my pig arms are cute and useless.  dipper: the brain goop! you ate it and built all this, didn't you?  mabel: (runs up to waddles with a children's animal sounds toy) this isn't right! the pig goes oink! the pig goes oink!!!  waddles: now the pig goes wherever he can shine the light of knowledge into the darkness of ignorance.  dipper: (sees the what-the-heck-ahedron that waddles solved) woah! what-the-heck-ahedron! how did you do that?  waddles: i can teach you, dipper. i can teach you many things. from the secrets of astrophysics, to the- (notices gompers chewing on his pillow) hey! hey! (squeals)  dipper: man, i am loving this new waddles.  mabel: yeah! he's uh. he's definitely, uh, different.  waddles: (shoots styrofoam rockets at gompers)  dipper: dude, that rocket cart is amazing. you and me should go invent stuff!  mabel: uh, waddles! don't you want to stay up here and record some morning pranks with me?  dipper: mabel, this pig's got a gift. he needs to share it with the world!  waddles: i'm sorry, mabel. there is more to life than making fart noises, and laughing at those fart noises. i see that now. (he and dipper leave)  mabel: right. yeah. you guys. just go on without me. (presses fart button)  cut to outside. grenda's kite is stuck in a tree.  grenda: oh, my kite got stuck in a tree. i hate everything! (sees waddles)  dipper: i bet we could be of service.  grenda: (sees waddles; screams) an affront against nature!  waddles: ha! forget kites! here. take this rocket pack i invented and explore the heavens yourself.  grenda: forget that! grenda's gonna look at boys through skylights. (flies away) i rule the skies.  dipper: dude, that rocket pack we made is amazing.  waddles: don't forget the laser gun i made for candy.  candy chiu: (offscreen) death to my enemies!  dipper and waddles: (laughing)  mabel: (on tape recording:) welcome to may may and the hogg. top story today: coping with crippling loneliness after losing my co-host. (presses button, which plays a recording of an electric guitar riff and a man saying ""loneliness!"". holds up a picture of ""waddles' birthday, probably???"") what did that nasty goop do to you? you're not happier like this, are you?  dipper: (fastening a bolt on a big machine) this is your greatest invention yet! it could solve every problem of mankind!  waddles: and bring me potatoes. delicious potatoes.  the machine puts a potato in his mouth.  waddles: (eats it) yummy yummy, for my fat little pig tummy.  mabel: (coming in) what the heck is going on here?  waddles: mabel, you are just in time to behold our greatest achievement. the ""smarticle accelerator"".  dipper: solving that brain puzzle was just the tip of the iceberg, with this, waddles will be able to solve all the greatest puzzles of the universe.  waddles: (drives into the machine) the origin of life. the meaning of existence. why dudes have nipples. (he presses a button, making the machine glow)  dipper: soon, your pig is gonna be famous! meeting with scientists, presidents... i wonder if i could teach him to wear pants.  mabel: the whole world? but when will you have time for us? i'm your best friend.  waddles: (he makes a mechanical hand pet her) i'm still your friend, mabel, but i'm helping people now.  mabel: but what about helping me? do you really want to spend your whole life in meetings with dumb smart guys? this brain junk has made you forget who you are. don't you remember... us?  waddles: (flashes back on various memories of hanging out with mabel) it all makes sense now. what good is helping the world if i can't help my favorite person in the world? it's a good thing i built in a dumb-dumb switch. (pulls a lever from ""fwd."" to ""rev"")  dipper: waddles, waddles, don't! wait!  waddles: i'm sorry, dipper. in my last eight seconds of consciousness i want you to know that science is a horizon to search for, not a prize to hold in your hand. also, i miss getting my tummy tickled. (squeals; jumps into mabel's arms)  mabel: oh, waddles!  the smarticle accelerator falls down.  dipper: no! our invention!  mabel: i know what'll make you feel better: a simple hug from a simple pig.  dipper: yeah, guess so. (takes waddles)  waddles: (licks him and throws up the what-the-heck-ahedron)  dipper: good pig. uggh.  cut back to stan in the mystery shack.  stan: you know what, you're right. don't buy the pig. in fact, i'm probably better off leaving him with my niece.  an arrow with a suction cup on the end sticks to his fez.  stan: no shooting in the house, sweetie! but perhaps i can interest you in something else. (walks back over to the chest and pulls out a tape) like these spooooky moooovies. movies are great! you watch the movie, you scare the girl, the girl snuggles up next to you, next thing you know you gotta raise a kid. your life falls apart. forget that last part. this next tale is called ""clay day""! (clay day title card appears. cut to the pines family and soos in the living room. mabel is watching tv)  cinnamon: (on tv:) you did it, shimmery twinkleheart!  shimmery twinkleheart: (on tv:) no, you did it, cinnamon...  mabel and shimmery twinkleheart: ...because you believed in yourself.  stan and soos: uhhh...  dipper: everything about this is bad.  stan: well, that just put me 90 minutes closer to death. (holds up movie) it's time you kids learned to watch the classics from my day.  mabel: ooo, old people movies. get ready for references we don't understand, and words we can't repeat.  stan: (puts the movie in)  the voyages of loinclothiclese begins.  loinclothiclese: (to cyclops:) you're no match for loinclothiclese! i've come for the golden pants!  cyclops: (turns to camera and roars)  mabel: (screams; runs off)  dipper: oh no. mabel!  stan: well. your sister's broken.  dipper: oh, grunkle stan, i should have told you before. mabel has a childhood terror of old-timey stop-motion animation. it's like her number one fear since we were kids.  stan: heh heh. come on, those hogey old things? how scared could she be?  cut to mabel hiding in the laundry basket in the attic.  mabel: the cyclops! his face is made of nightmares!  stan: (opens the closet door) kid, it's just a movie, it can't hurt you!  mabel: no talking. they wait for you to talk and then crawl inside your mouth!  dipper: why did you have to show her that tape?  stan: there's got to be a way to get her over this! (looks at the back of the tape) huh...  cut to everyone at the gates of harry claymore's workplace. mabel is still in the laundry basket.  stan: alright. if we can just get the director to show her the models are fake, maybe she'll finally calm down.  soos ramirez: i don't know, dude. according to the internet, special effects genius harry claymore is some kind of recluse.  stan: the man wants his privacy. i can respect that. (swings rope over gate) well, everyone over the fence.  everyone is in the yard, heading to the house.  stan: you see, mabel, those monsters are just clay models moved around one frame at a time, by an antisocial shut-in.  soos: those people are called animators.  dipper: hello? mr. claymore?  stan: we wanna get a look at your figurines!  soos: we're not paparazzi! (flashes camera phone several times)  dipper: aha! (picks up a mini gorilla figurine) see, mabel? it's all just special effects. you can come out.  mabel: no.  stan: kid, listen to me. for the last time, there is nothing here to be afraid--  clay cyclops walks up behind stan  cyclops: (roars)  dipper, stan, and soos: (scream)  stan: (drops the basket with mabel in it and backs away, as cyclops swipes at them) it's slowly (swipe) swiping at us! (swipe)  soos: let's escape by standing still! (is picked up by cyclops) it didn't work!  the cyclops grabs stan and skeletons pop out of the ground.  dipper: (screams; runs off. he trips over mabel's basket, which throws her out.)  skeleton: (grabs mabel's head)  mabel: ahh! (runs and trips in front of the stairs. gets back up and runs up the stairs)  dipper: (being stuck in clay along with stan and soos) ah! how is this happening? what do they want?  harry claymore: i'm afraid they want you. (he is also tied up)  stan: harry claymore! master of special effects! circa-1970's-something.  harry claymore: alas, my effects are more special than you know.  dipper: what? but how are these things real? what about stop motion?  harry: what? you really believe someone moves these figures one frame at a time? i'm not a masochist! i use black magic to make them animate themselves. it was great at first, but one day...  flashback  cyclops: (looks at newspaper, which says that computer animation is better than stop motion) no! where's the heart?  harry: now that they were out of work, they went mad and enslaved me! and now they will turn you into unholy beasts clay to join in their mischeif!  soos: huh, mr. pines. at least you finally get to work with your favorite director. and by work, i mean suffocate inside a big wad of clay!  more clay is stuffed on soos. the three call out for help. mabel sees the whole thing.  mabel: oh, what do i do? how can i defeat those monstrosities? (picks up a wad of clay with two holes in them. mabel adds a line so it looks like a smiley face) hey. i changed into something i like. woah. i think i have an idea! (runs down stairs.) hey, one-eyeclopses! yeah, i'm talking to you, dumb-dumb! come at me! wooaaaaa!!! (runs at it with her arms in front of her and jumps into its stomach, crawls up it, and emerges from its shoulders) wipe that face off your face! (smears it) oh, i've got big plans for you. (later) hey, skeleton dorks! it's clayback time!!  the cyclops is remade into shimmery twinkleheart.  shimmery twinkleheart: (walks up and falls down on a bunch of skeletons)  soos: dude, you conquered your fear!  shimmery twinkleheart: that's right. because she believed in herself-  mabel: jam, it, twinkleheart! just start pounding those skeletons!  shimmery twinkleheart: hoo hoo hoo... (attacking skeletons)  mabel: (runs to everyone else)  dipper: mabel, you did it! so you're not scared anymore?  mabel: (taking the clay off of him) oh, i'm scared twice as much now. but now i know it's rational! (starts taking the clay off of stan)  stan: kid, i'm sorry i doubted you. (punches through clay). you were right! stop-motion is pure evil.  we see the stop-motion monsters fighting in shadow. shimmery twinkleheart punches several skeletons.  soos: and probably really expensive.  harry claymore: incredibly expensive.  soos: this is an impressive fight, though. i'm glad i'm facing towards it.  a scorpion with the head of medusa attacks shimmery twinkleheart and they melt into the mass of clay. unicorns rain from the ceiling and fall into it.  all: (clapping) yaaaaayyyyy!!  harry claymore: that was the best part!  cut back to the mystery shack. stan, dipper, and mabel are watching ""loiclothiclese in the creature with an unreasonable amount of heads.""  dipper: well, i think today we learned that you can remold your fears.  mabel: i'm just glad that none of us got turned into clay.  soos: holy toledo! (he steps out of a wall of clay and looks like gumby) who wants to see me change into most anything? do do do do do... (becomes cylinder shaped, then normal shaped) i can walk through walls! (runs out of shot and back into shot from opposite side) woah, woa-  stan: (throws the tv remote at him, cutting off his head) we're safe now kids. we're safe. (cut back to stan in the mystery shack at night) i don't get it. you don't want the pig, you don't want my tapes, what are ya gonna buy?! how about this delicious potion? here, have a free sample. (gives person the potion)  traveler: (drinks it, then stumbles around and collapses)  stan: you should have bought my merch when you had the chance, buddy. but that's okay. i'll have something new for sale very soon. (painting the person with glue) heh heh heh heh...  cut to the mystery shack at day. the person is in a glass case that says ""the cheapskate"" on the front.  stan: (leading a tour group) and here we have our latest attraction: the legendary cheapskate.  girl: i saw it blinking.  stan: heh! just an optical illusion.  woman: (takes picture)  stan: (leading group away) come along, everyone. step right up... ahahaha!  traveler: (pounds on glass)  stan: (returns) that's right, i'm a jerk!  epilogue. mabel is standing in front of the case and dipper is reading on the gift shop counter.  mabel: (to person:) hey! wanna play tic-tac-toe? (draws tic-tac-toe board on glass)  traveler: (draws x in the top middle space)  mabel: hey, i wanted to be xs! let me be xs.  dipper: trust me, just let her be xs.  traveler: (sighs and draws an o in the middle space)  mabel: yaaay!

(lifts her eyelid)  jeff: lift with your knees. no, your knees. if i go one more hour without eating, i'm gonna resort to cannibalism. (notices lazy susan, and tips his hat.) ma'am.  lazy susan: (shrieks) little magic men! what does it mean? what do i do? (bumps into a payphone and dials 911) yes, hi. i's like to report something. i'm at greasy's diner. you won't believe what i've witnessed. (cut to two figures sneaking up behind her, from a patch of nearby bushes) it's unbelievable! it's indescribable! it's- aaaaaaah!!

(writes ""failed"" at the top of the page) i wish i could just forget about them forever.  dipper: hey, if it's any consolation, my summer mission isn't a huge success either. i'm still trying to find the author of this journal, but with this laptop smashed, i've lost any lead in finding him.  mabel: (looks at the laptop) wait a minute. dipper, look!  dipper: through your bottle?  mabel: just do it.  dipper: (peers through the bottle, and notices a logo entitled ""mcgucket labs"" magnified on the back of the laptop) ""mcgucket labs."" wait, old man mcgucket?  mabel: you don't think?...  dipper: couldn't be... doesn't make any sense, unless...

(whispering:) not great.  blind ivan: and you've never met me before. and if you had, you wouldn't remember. (he removes his hood, revealing a bald tattooed head and a red scar through one eye) i am blind ivan, and we are the society of the blind eye. formed many years ago by our founder... our founder... does anyone remember who he was?  bud gleeful: we've been usin' that ray on our own brains an awful lot.  dipper: why would you do all this? what do you have to gain?  blind ivan: as you have no doubt discovered, gravity falls is a town plagued with supernatural strangeness. no one knew how to stop the things that went bump in the night, so our founder invented the next best thing: a way for us to forget. we took it upon ourselves to help the troubled townsfolk by erasing the memories of the strange things they've seen. now the people of gravity falls go about their lives ignorant and happy, thanks to us. and as a perk, we help ourselves forget things that trouble us. everyone has something they'd rather forget. in fact, your own sister was about to use that ray on herself. isn't that right?  dipper: mabel? seriously?  mabel: ha ha, maybe...  dipper: don't you see? this is ruining lives! what about old man mcgucket? he lives in a hut and talks to animals, thanks to you. don't you feel bad about that?  blind ivan: mmm, maybe a little. (shoots himself with the ray) but not anymore. you won't be telling anyone else what you've learned here. say good-bye to your summer. (he aims the ray gun at them)  soos: guys, if we're gonna forget everything, i got some stuff i wanna get off my chest. mabel, for half the summer, i thought your name was maple, like the syrup. no one corrected me!  mabel: i only love some of my stuffed animals, and the guilt is killing me!  dipper: sometimes i use big words, and i don't actually know what they mean. i mean, i'm supposed to be the smart guy. if i'm not the smart guy, who am i?  wendy: okay, i'm not actually laid back. i'm stressed, like, 24/7. have you met my family?  blind ivan: oh, stop being a bunch of babies. (mcgucket jumps down and knocks away the gun.) owie!  all: mcgucket?!  mcgucket: i raided the mining display for weapons. now fight like a hillbilly, fellers!  everyone grabs a weapon: banjos, stuffed raccoons etc. soos grabs an informational display about dysentery.  soos: oh, nobody better miss!  blind ivan: they know too much. don't let them escape!  wendy: (attacking a society member) get this song outta your head!  soos: dysentery's gonna get you, dawg!  dipper: mcgucket's memory tube.  tats: oh no you don't!  dipper: (puts the memory tube into a transport tube. it zooms around the room.) mabel, catch!  sprott: i'll take that, thank you. give it up, boy. you're no match for the unstoppable power of- (his rob is caught in the tube and rips off, leaving him in his underwear.) that's right, i don't wear nothin' under my robe. not gonna apologize for that. maybe y'all should apologize for bein' a bunch of prudes.  all: eew!  soos: well, time to erase that forever. (he holds up the gun, but blind ivan snatches it.)  blind ivan: give me that tube.  dipper: never! that memory belongs to mcgucket.  blind ivan: the society's secrets belong to us. (he has the group in a corner and points the ray at them.) end of the line. by tomorrow, this will all seem like a bad dream. say goodbye to your precious memories. (he fires the gun)  dipper: no!! (he shields his eyes, but finds mcgucket has jumped in front of the group, catching the ray.) mcgucket, you took a bullet for me. (as mcgucket gets shot with the ray again.) oh my gosh! are you okay!  mcgucket: okay as i'll ever be! (laughs)  dipper: what?  blind ivan: (he keeps shooting at mcgucket, who slowly walks toward him.) why... isn't... this... working?  mcgucket: hit me with your best shot, baldy. but my mind's been gone for thirty-odd years. you can't break what's already broken!   mcgucket : say goodnight, sally!

(on screen: a hand rips off blendin's name tag, and his suit turns into a prison design) and then i was given ten squared life sentences in time prison. i spent every day since then planning my vengeance. (on screen: blendin shapes mashed slop like dipper and mabel's faces, then squishes them. turns off flashback) and now finally, it has come!  dipper: look, we're sorry about all that, but we're in the middle of something really important right now.  mabel: it's our friend's birthday today, and we promised we wouldn't leave his side!  blendin: what? you think some dumb birthday matters right now? do you know where you are? welcome...to globnar!  the far end of the room opens to show the globnar arena. events are taking place, like falling through portals, being set on fire, fighting a glob monster, battling on a moving clock, and fighting one another with age-altering weapons.  mabel: is this a reality show? are we in japan?  blendin: it's gladiatorial time combat!  a man in a green future suit falls down, and another is lifted up by a rock and given a <a class=""new"" data-uncrawlable-url=""l3dpa2kvvgltzv9xaxnop2fjdglvbj1lzgl0jnjlzgxpbms9mq=="" rel=""nofollow"" title=""time wish (page does not exist)"">time wish.  blendin: the winner gets a precious time wish, and then decides the loser's fate!  loser: (shaking with fear) n-n-no! please!  winner: (holds up a thumbs-up, then changes it to thumbs-down and smiles. loser screams while being vacuumed away by a purple beam of light) (dipper and mabel look on in horror)  blendin: and the two of you are officially challenged. dundgren! get me my war-paint.  mabel: dipper, we need a way out of here! but how?  dipper: (sees lolph with a time device) i have an idea.  mabel: hang in there soos, we're coming for you.  cut back to laser tag at big guns  soos: dipper? mabel? requesting backup! ah! oh! ah, ah! oh no!

(points to a cloud shaped like an animal; an airplane flies out of its ""mouth"")  wendy corduroy: —barfing an airplane. (everyone laughs)  dipper pines: it does.  thompson: (points to a waffle-shaped cloud) uh, that looks like... uh, a cloud!  lee: boo!  wendy: thompson, stop being the worst at everything.  thompson: (chuckles) sorry guys.

(takes tambry's cell phone out of her hands)  tambry: hey!  wendy swipes through several images of the bands.  wendy: they're all coming! scarves indoors, wood grain on everything, the love god! you've probably seen him in that viral video.  love god: (in the video:) who's ready to fall in love tonight? (the crowd cheers and he stumbles face-first into the camera) whoa! ow! i hope nobody's filming this!  dipper: whoa! like a real concert concert? i've never actually been to one of those before. (brushes elbow)  wendy: that's because you've never had an awesome crew to roll with before!

(his cell phone begins to ring)  cell phone ringtone: (robbie singing:) wendy, i miss you so much. i'll never move on. never ever.  robbie: (eyes still on wendy, robbie throws cell phone back. it hits the headstone, breaking) that was a different wendy. unrelated wendy.  lee: (quietly, to nate:) dude, this is getting really awkward.  tambry: yeah, the cemetery used to be fun; now it's just depressing.  everyone but mabel starts walking away.  robbie: (sighs, grabs a shovel and begins to shovel dirt onto his head)  mabel: wait! you guys! he's in pain. we can't just ditch him here.  dipper: come on, mabel, it's robbie.  mabel: but he's suffering. how can i be happy if i know someone else is sad? it totally throws off my happiness chart.  dipper: mabel, trust me. if there's one thing i've learned this summer, it's not to get mixed up in needless romantic drama. (whispering:) besides, we're finally in with wendy's friends. with robbie gone, there's a good social balance. maybe we should let the good thing be, you know.  robbie: (to a nearby vulture:) just eat me already, man.

(rummaging through a suitcase full of various medieval weapons as soos comes out) lock down the shack and hide my shirts before anyone tie-dyes them! (pulls out a crossbow and aims them at the hot air balloons) they're slow. i could probably take a few down.  soos: wait, mr. pines! (moving stan's crossbow out of the way as the arrow flies off; a bird caws off-screen) i've been thinking. every year this festival comes by and every year you shun what could be potential customers.  stan: you really think i could make money off of these free-loading, kale-munching freak shows?  soos: you just gotta figure out what appeals to them.  stan: hmm. how do i appeal to young people? so young people are into hot air balloons, ehh?  cut to mabel at the front door of the valentino household.  mabel: alright, mabel. robbie's a broken teacup and you're going to piece him back together.

(taking a seat on his bed, across from mabel)  mabel: but when i saw you in the cemetery today, i realized, robbie's not a bad guy. he's just a heartbroken soul who needs love and gloves with fingers.  robbie: hey, fingerless gloves look awesome!  mabel: (wagging a finger and chuckling) no they don't. robbie, you just need a good matchmaker. i guarantee i'll find you true love or twice your sadness back.  robbie: (sighs) if i say yes, will you leave my room?  mabel: (zips robbie's hoodie) i guarantee it.  cut to mabel in her room, sitting in front of a miniature diorama of the town and its residents.  mabel: (cracks knuckles) okay, gravity falls, who wants to go out with robbie?

(mabel walks away, but dipper pauses to listen) false names, double lives, one minute they're playing with water balloons, the next they're building doomsday devices. your uncle scammed the whole world. you gonna let him scam you, too?  dipper: you (hesitates) you don't know what you're talking about. (walks away)  trigger: you're gonna regret this!! (airbag inflates, trigger cries out, the car's horn beeps)  cut to dipper and mabel hiding on the side of the road. two government vehicles pass by, and as they do, dipper and mabel disappear from the roadside. the camera angle changes to show them hiding in the trunk of the rear car, and an arrow-shaped sign pointing in the direction they're headed that reads ""mystery shack"". cut to a view of the countdown, which now reads roughly five hours. cut to stan in the interrogation room, checking his wristwatch device.  stan: only five more hours till it happens. i gotta be there! come on, stan, you gotta think of a way outta this.

(looks on the bookshelf and in a filing cabinet)  mabel: (seeing a bolt on the jackalope head mounted on wall) wait! the antelabbit!  dipper: don't you mean ""jackalope?""  mabel: pfft, that can't be right. (fixes the jackalope's bent antler, and the wall turns open to reveal two old-looking tv monitors and a tape player)  dipper and mabel: yes!  mabel: (points to a tape halfway in the player) it's this week, this is it!

(takes a deep breath) son of a--  dipper: (shuts off the tape as mabel covers her ears) that's him, alright.  mabel: okay, okay, so maybe grunkle stan stole some toxic waste. that doesn't mean he's leading a nefarious double life!  dipper: (pulls a box from under the tv screen) mabel, i'm not so sure about that... (takes a lamp from the desk and turns it on, revealing a box full of passports and ids)  mabel: (she and dipper looking through the box) what? what is all this? (reading from one of the ids:) ""stetson pinefield?""  dipper: (reading from ids:) ""hal forrester?"" ""andrew '8-ball' alcatraz?"" these are fake ids, mabel! you wouldn't need these unless you were trying to hide your real identity!  mabel: but why would stan do that?

(after a brief pause she scoots forward and looks into the potted plant) ...any minute, justin.  dipper: i can't believe it. this whole summer i've been looking for answers and the biggest mystery was right under our nose.  mabel: (digs through clippings) ugh, there's gotta be some kind of explanation in here somewhere. what the...

(blows a handful of glitter directly into soos' face, getting it in his eyes)  soos: aah! attack glitter! it's pretty, but it hurts!   dipper and mabel: (jump on soos) c'mon soos... c'mon... c'mon... please!  soos: (holds them back as they try to get past) aww, c'mon, i don't wanna fight you guys! this hurts me more than it hurts you! (as he is getting kicked in the face by mabel) ah! seriously, it hurts me way more that it hurts you!  dipper reaches for the number pad and enters the code. all shout as the vending machine swings forward, shoving them to the floor. all cough, then gasp at the secret passage behind the machine.  soos: (leading the way down the stairs) it's like something from a video game...  mabel: or a dream...  dipper: ...or a nightmare.  cut to shot of stan's feet as he races back to the shack, cut to soos, dipper &amp; mabel heading down in the elevator, then cut back to stan, checking the watch.  stan: i gotta be there when it happens!

(kicks desk) why would he have those journals?!  soos: maybe he's the author.  dipper: or maybe he stole them from the author! maybe the reason he has all those fake ids is because he is a master criminal, and this machine is his master plan! (opens each journal to the page with the portal on it, lays them accordingly, and turns on his black light. gasps)  mabel: whoa.  dipper: (reading from the journals:) ""i was wrong the whole time. the machine was meant to create knowledge but it is too powerful. i was deceived, and now it is too late. the device, if fully operational, could tear our universe apart! it must not fall into the wrong hands. if the clock ever reaches zero, our universe is doomed!""

(as mabel comes over) hmmpf! no-no, false alarm. hmmpf! just gotta ride it out!  ford: listen, there'll be time for introductions later. but first, tell me, stan: are there any security breaches? does anyone else know about this portal?  stan: no, just us. also maybe the entire u.s. government.  ford: the what?!  agent powers: (seen on security camera; to other agents:) fan out! we're not going anywhere till we find stan pines and those kids!  ford: (sighs) okay. it's all right. we've got a while before they find this room. we just need to lay low and think of a plan.  mabel: well, it looks like we're stuck down here for a while. who wants to tell us their entire mysterious backstory?  ford: yes, i have some questions about this myself, stanley.  dipper: stanley?  mabel: but your name is stanford.  ford: wait, you took my name?! what have you been doing all these years, you knucklehead?!  dipper: yeah, grunkle stan, no more lies! you owe us some answers: what's the deal with this portal? why did you keep this a secret?  mabel: and what happened between you and your brother?  soos: i hope all this aligns exactly with my fanfic, stan. if not, i will be very disappointed.  stan: okay okay okay, i have a lot of explaining to do. it all started... a lifetime ago... nineteen sixty something. glass shard beach, new jersey. (cut to a seagull landing on a sign that says ""glass shard beach-home of glass shard water toffee"" and coughing up a bottlecap) i lived with my ma and pa in the lead paint district in the family pawn shop. (cut to stan's father sitting down in a chair) dad was a strict man. tough as a cinderblock and not easily impressed.  filbrick pines: i'm not impressed.  stan: ma was a pathological liar, which served her well as a phone psychic.  caryn pines: (to someone on phone:) that'll be 99 cents an hour.... no, you're overpriced.... yeah, i predicted you were gonna hang up.  stan: (cut to ford as a child reading in the top bunk of a bed) and then there was my nerdy twin brother, stanford. as if his abnormally high iq wasn't enough, he also had a rare birth defect: (cut to an x-ray of stanford's hands, with the extra pinkies circled and the word ""abnormality"" written above) six fingers on each hand. (cut to ford drawing in a notebook) which might have explained his obsession with sci-fi mystery weirdness. (cut to stan as a child with a bucket on his head running into a wall) as for me, i had what mom liked to call: personality. (in the flashback, stan throws the bucket off his head and the twins laugh and run off.) but as different as we were, we were the perfect team. (cut to the twins walking around in a cave) and every day we'd wander the beach, looking for adventure. (in the flashback:) whoooaa...  ford: (in the flashback:) a shipwrecked sailboat, possibly haunted by pirate ghosts!  stan: this is the greatest thing i've ever seen! and i've once seen a dead rat floatin' in a bucket!  ford: (pushes him) hahaha, ew, what's wrong with you?  stan: huh, you know what this thing's missin'?  ford: flags.  cut to the twins pushing the boat, which has their shirts hanging off the masts, down the beach. they are both badly sunburned.  ford and stan: kings of new jersey! kings of new jersey! kings of new jersey!  ford: (kneeling in front of the boat which has ""stan o' war"" painted on its side) i dub thee: the stan o' war!

(leaves with his friends) ha, hahahaha! dorks and losers...  ford: (looking at his hand)  stan: hey. don't let those idiots get to you.  ford: but i am a freak. i just wonder if there's anywhere in the world where weirdos like me fit in.  stan: hey, chin up, buddy. look. (he and ford look at the sea) one of these days, you and me are gonna sail away from this dumb town. we'll hunt for treasure, get all the girls, and be an unstoppable team of adventurers.  ford: you really mean it?  stan: high six?  ford: high six. (""high sixes"" him)  stan: (voice-over from the present:) those were the good times. those bullies may have been right about us not making many friends, but when push comes to shove, you only really need one.

(he and ford are putting a sail on their boat; cut to stan in class blowing a paper through a straw at a student next to him, then leaning over and copying off of ford) sure i got in more than my fair share of trouble, but when your brother's the smartest kid in school, you've always got a leg up on the competition. (cut to ford winning a science fair, and then stan comes over and puts his arm around him) the future was lookin' bright. for both of us. till one day... (cut to stan eating toffee peanuts in class while ford writes something)  woman: (over pa:) pines twins to the principal's office. pines twins to the principal's office.  stan: ah, great, what is it this time?  cut ford and stan starting to go into the principal's office. a woman at her desk stops them.  woman: (to stan:) not you; him.  stan: (sits in chair) uh.  ford: (walks into the office, sees that his parents are there and sits in the chair between them)  principal: now, mr. pines, i'd like to speak with you very frankly if i may.  filbrick: very frankly is the only way i speak.  principal: you have two sons: one of them is incredibly gifted, the other one is standing outside of this room and his name's stanley.  caryn: what are you saying?  principal: i'm saying your son, stanford, is a genius! all his teachers are going bananas over his science fair experiment! (gives ford a pamphlet) ya ever heard of west coast tech? best college in the country. their graduates turn science fiction into science fact! the admissions team is visiting tomorrow to check out stanford's experiment. your son may be a future millionare, mr. pines.  filbrick: i'm impressed.  caryn: but what about our little free spirit, stanley?  principal: that clown? at this rate he'll be lucky to graduate high school. look, there's a saltwater taffy store on the dock. and somebody's gotta get paid to scrape the barnacles off of it. stanford's goin' places. but hey, look on the bright side: at least you'll have one son here in new jersey forever.  stan: (sits down sadly outside the door; cut to ford and stan on the swings) heh. joke's on them if they think you wanna go to some stuffy college on the other side of the country. once we get the stan o' war complete, it's gonna be beaches, babes, and international treasure hunting for us.  ford: look, stan, i can't pass up a chance like this. this school has cutting edge programs and multi-dimensional paradigm theory.  stan: beep boop. i am a nerd robot. that's you. that's what you sound like.  ford: heheh. ah, well, if the college board isn't impressed with my experiment tomorrow, then okay, i'll do the treasure-hunting thing.  stan: and if they are?  ford: (punches him) well then, i guess you better come visit me on the other side of the country. haha. (walks away)  stan: (voice-over from the present:) without ford i was just half of a dynamic duo. i couldn't make it without him. (cut to stan walking through the science experiments at the school at night.) and now, thanks to that dumb college, i was gonna lose my brother forever. (in the flashback, stan stops at ford's experiment. in the flashback:) this is all your fault, ya dumb machine! (punches the table and a piece comes off the machine) oh no. oh no no, what did i do? (puts the piece back on) there. alright. good as new. probably. (puts the tarp back on and leaves; cut to ford in front of the tarp the next morning with the college board)  man: alright, kid. show us what ya got.  ford: okay! well, what would you say if i told you that the future of technology was beneath this sheet? (pulls tarp off)  man: i'd say that we wasted a car trip.  ford: what? (looks at machine, which isn't moving) but it was stable yesterday! a fuse must have blown or something.  man: (crosses ""stanford pines"" off of a list of names) kid, a perpetual motion machine has one job: to not stop. i don't think you're west coast tech material. (leads the other college board members away)  ford: no, wait! don't go! i worked so hard! (steps on an empty toffee peanuts bag, picks it up and growls)  stan: (cut to their house; he is sitting on a couch playing with a paddleball) one-paddle-paddle-paddle, two-paddle-paddle. man, that jackie-o, what a fox. (ford enters) hey, what's the word, sixer?  ford: (holds up toffee peanuts bag) can you explain what this was doing next to my broken project?!  stan: ho-okay. i might have accidentally been, horsing around-  ford: this was no accident, stan; you did this! you did this because you couldn't handle me going to college on my own!  stan: look, this was a mistake! although if you think about it, maybe there's a silver lining. huh? treasure hunting?  ford: are you kidding me? why would i want to do anything with the person who sabotaged my entire future?! (shoves stan onto the couch)  filbrick: (picks up stanley by his shirt) you did what, you knucklehead?  caryn: (comes out of a room with a crying baby) stanley? what's goin' on in here?  stan: wait, no, i can explain; it was a mistake!  filbrick: (throws stan outside) you ignoramus! your brother was gonna be our ticket out of this dump! all you ever do is lie and cheat right on your brother's coattails. well this time you cost our family potential millions! and until you make us a fortune, you aren't welcome in this household. (throws a duffel bag at him)  stan: what?! stanford, tell him he's bein' crazy! (ford, who was watching out his window, closes his curtains) stanford? don't leave me hangin'. high six? (filbrick slams the door) fine. i can make it on my own! i don't need you! i don't need anyone! i'll make millions and you'll rue the day you turned your back on me! (gets in his car and drives away; voice-over from the present:) thanks to one dumb mistake i had no brother, no home, no nothing. but i had a plan to fix everything.  cut back to the present.  mabel: oh! this story's so sad! i know what you two little broken teacups need: to hug it out! hug it out! hug train's comin' in the station. hugapolooza! two thousand!  stan: kid, will ya knock that off? i'm tryin' to tell my life story here. (cut to stan as a young man with a metal detector on the beach) i had decided i wasn't gonna show my face at home until i made something of myself. unfortunately, the treasure-hunting business was slow going. apparently gold was some kind of... rare metal. (in the flashback, stan sees a billboard advertising the traveling salesman lifestyle and throws his metal detector away) luckily i struck a different kind of gold.... in sales. (cut to stan in a commercial; in commercial:) hi! i'm stan pines of stan co. enterprises. are sick of this always happening to you? (a pitcher of juice is thrown at him, getting juice all over him) then you need the shammy of the future! (begins to wipe himself off, then the commercial skips ahead to him completely clean) made with the same material astronauts use to clean up cranberry stains on the moon! that's the sham total! it's a total sham. (voice-over from the present:) i had made my mark, all right. unfortunately, so did the shammies. (cut to a woman using a sham total to clean a robe, but the blue dye from the shammy leaks onto it.) apparently the cheap dye i used to color them only made stains worse. (cut to an angry mob) customers went crazy about that. fortunately they were using stan co. brand pitchforks. (the mob's pitchforks break; stanley drives by them in his car; in flashback:) suckers! (voice-over from present:) i was officially banned from new jersey, but with a quick name change, steve pinington was ready to take on pennsylvania. (in another commercial:) hi! i'm steve pinington! (pulls at band-aid on his arm) are you sick of bandages that are hard to remove? then what you need is the rip off! the rip off won't give you rashes, i repeat: it won't give you rashes. (the words ""it won't give you rashes"" appears on the screen; voice-over from present as angry mob with rashes chases stanley out of pennsylvania:) it gave ya rashes. (cut to a map of usa with a line moving around it) i traveled the whole country, sometimes outside of it, always one step ahead of the law, looking for something that would be my big break.  cut back to the present.  mabel: whoa. so that explains all the fake ids.  dipper: (to ford:) but, wait, what about you? did you end up going to your dream school?  ford: not exactly. (cut back to the past, on the auditorium of backupsmore university)  speaker: (standing at podium) alright, i know backupsmore wasn't anyone's first choice, but what we lack in prestige, we make up for in mostly bug-free dorms! i'm sure your families are proud, more or less.  ford: (sitting in the audience, looks at a picture of his family; cut to him studying in his dorm; voice-over from the present:) in a place like that, i had to work twice as hard. luckily, that's what i do best. i went from undergrad to phd three years ahead of schedule, wrote a thesis that was nationally ranked, and was awarded an enormous grant for my own scientific research! but what to study. (cut to ford looking at his hand, then at a book about anomalies) my whole life i'd been teased for my six fingers. but that got my thinking about anomalies: things that were odd, unusual, statistically improbable. and according to my investigations, there was one place with a higher concentration of these things than anywhere else. (cut to ford standing in front of a map of usa with dots marked on it, most of which are in oregon. ford circles oregon) a small lumber town in roadkill country, oregon: gravity falls.  stan: (in a flashback, marks xs on a map of usa titles ""states i'm banned in""; voice-over from present:) meanwhile, your old uncle stan was doing great. i had come up with a sophisticated new business strategy. (in the flashback, picks up a lottery card and begins scratching some circles off with a coin, in flashback:) come on, owl... (scratches another owl) owl... (scratches a football player with an omelet) football player with an omelet!? gah! (crumples the card up and throws it against the window; voice-over from present:) i was in great shape, living on my own, and the best part was: i didn't need help from nobody. (cut to him in the flashback dialing a number at a payphone)  ford: (in flashback, over phone:) hello? this is stanford pines.  stan: (hangs up phone and sighs)  ford: (driving into gravity falls; voice-over from the present:) i was heading out on my own as well. (standing in front of the mystery shack being constructed) i set to work using my grant money to investigate the strange properties of this town, but what would i find here? (a giant hand grabs his car) bingo. i began to investigate at once. (cut to him setting a journal on a table, tracing his hand, pasting the trace on the journal, and writing ""1"" on it) i knew i'd have to record my findings. i began to keep a journal...  dipper: (screams) the journals!!!  cut back to the present. everyone is staring at dipper.  dipper: sorry, sorry, (clears throat) just got excited there... about the journals... keep-keep talking.  ford: i began to keep a journal...  dipper: (screams)  ford: just going to ignore that. there were anomalies everywhere. and the more i looked, the more i saw. (cut to him as a young man catching eye-bats and putting them into a jar, then recording it in his journal; the shape shifter hatches in front of him, then immediately turns into a cup. stanford writes in his journal about the ""floating cliffs"". cut to him and a gnome that looks like shmebulock; in flashback:) fascinating, what did you say your name was?  gnome: shmebulock... senior.  ford: (writes in journal 3 and looks at cover; voice-over from present:) it was finally a place where i felt at home, but something nagged at me: where did it all come from? it seemed to me the answer must come from outside of our world, a dimension of weirdness leaking into ours. i realized the only way to understand gravity falls would be to build a gateway: a portal to the source of its weirdness. (in the flashback, is drawing the portal map in the journals) but i couldn't make it alone. i decided to call up my old college buddy, fiddleford mcgucket, a young but brilliant mechanic, who was wasting his talent trying to make personal computers in some garage in <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palo_alto,_california"" title=""wikipedia:palo alto, california"">palo alto. (cut to mcgucket's garage full of computers, where he is playing a banjo when the phone rings. he picks it up)  mcgucket: hello? fiddleford computermajigs?.. you say you're tryin' to build a transuniversal polydimensional metavortex? well that's mathematically feasible! i reckon. (spits)  ford: (cut to ford and mcgucket working on the portal, when the power surges) many long nights were spent perfecting the machine. it would be a crowning achievement of my studies. an answer to the source of this town's anomalies.  tyler's mother: (to tyler cutebiker, who is on a bike:) git out, git out, git out! (the two hurriedly leave the area)  ford: (he and mcgucket carry a dummy to the portal) the time had come to test it. (in flashback:) ready, and... (they release the dummy, but a rope from it catches mcgucket and he flies toward the portal, screaming) what? (grabs the rope and holds him, back but mcgucket's head is in the portal) i got ya, buddy! (pulls the rope and mcgucket and the dummy come out of the portal; to mcgucket:) what is it? is it working? what did you see?!  mcgucket: ahh! votmzrig ivskrx oory.  ford: fiddleford?  mcgucket: when gravity falls and earth becomes sky, fear the beast with just one eye.  ford: fiddleford, get a hold of yourself, you're not making any sense. (puts his hand on mcgucket's shoulder)  mcgucket: (jerks away) this machine is dangerous. you'll bring about the end of the world with this. destroy it before it destroys us all!  ford: i can't destroy this; it's my life's work!  mcgucket: i fear we've unleashed a grave danger on the world. one i'd just as soon forget. i quit! (walks away)  ford: fine! i'll do it without you! i don't need you! i don't need anyone! (a whispering sound is heard) what? who said that? (backs into a wall; voice-over from the present:) i was in over my head, and feared i was losing my sanity. i needed help. someone i could trust.  stan: (cut to him in his apartment when he hears knocking. grabs baseball bat) just give me a few more days, rico! i'll pay your goons back, i swear! (a gravity falls postcard comes through his mail slot. he looks out and sees the post man leaving. he looks at the postcard which says ""please come! -ford. cut to him walking up to ford's door) you haven't seen your brother in over ten years. it's okay. he's family. he won't bite. (knocks)  ford: (opens door) who is it?! have you come to steal my eyes?! (points crossbow)  stan: well, i can always count on you for a warm welcome.  ford: stanley, did anyone follow you? anyone at all?  stan: eh, hello to you, too, pal. (as ford grabs him and pulls him inside) ah!  ford: (shines flashlight in stan's eyes)  stanley: (pushes him away) ah! hey! what is this?  ford: sorry, i just had to make sure you weren't... uh, it's nothing. come in, come in. (darts away)  stan: (following him) uh, you gonna explain what's going on, here? you're acting like mom after her tenth cup of coffee.  ford: (holding journal 1) listen, there isn't must time. i've made huge mistakes and i don't know who i can trust anymore. (turns the head of a skeleton away from him)  stan: hey, uh, easy there. let's talk this through, okay?  ford: i have something to show you. something you won't believe.  stan: look, i've been around the world, okay? whatever it is, i'll understand. (standing in the portal room) there is nothing about this i understand.  ford: it's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension. i created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe. but it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction. that's why i shut it down and hid my journals, which explained how to operate it. there's only one journal left. and you are the only person i can trust to take it. (gives stan the journal) i have something to ask of you: you remember our plans to sail around the world on a boat? (stan smiles.) take this book, get on a boat, and sail as far away as ya can! to the edge of the earth! bury it where no one can find it!  stan: that's it?! you finally wanna see me after ten years, and it's to tell me to get as far away from you as possible!?  ford: stanley, you don't understand what i'm up against! what i've been through!  stan: no, no. you don't understand what i've been through! i've been to prison in three different countries! i once had to chew my way out of the trunk of a car! you think you've got problems? i've got a mullet, stanford! meanwhile, where have you been? living it up in your fancy house in the woods! selfishly hoarding your college money, because you only care about yourself.  ford: i'm selfish? i'm selfish, stanley? how can you say that after costing me my dream school?! i'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life and you won't even listen!  stan: well, listen to this: you want me to get rid of this book? fine, i'll get rid of it right now! (takes out lighter)  ford: no! (grabs the journal) you don't understand!  stan: (takes it back) you said you wanted me to have it so i'll do what i want with it!  ford: my research! (tackles stan, then runs for the journal, but stan trips him. ford runs after him) stanley, give it back! (pushes him onto some of the buttons)  stan: you want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that!  the portal turns on.  stan: (trying to pull the journal away from ford) you left me behind, you jerk! it was supposed to be us forever, you ruined my life!  ford: you ruined your own life! (kicks him into the side of the control panel, branding the symbol onto his back. stan screams and falls to the floor) stanley! oh my gosh i'm so sorry! are you alr-  stan punches ford, who stumbles backward and trips over the lever. stan follows him.  stan: some brother you turned out to be. you care more about your dumb mysteries than your family? well then you can have 'em. (shoves ford back into the portal light, and he starts getting sucked into it) whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on? hey, hey, stanford-  ford: stanley! stanley, help me!  stan: oh, no, what do i do?!!  ford: stanley! stanley! do something! stanley! (throws journal 1 at stan and disappears into the portal)  a flash of white engulfs everything. when it fades, stan is lying on the floor.  stan: stanford?  ford's glasses fall onto the floor.  stan: (runs to the portal) stanford, come back! i-i didn't mean it! (pounds on the side of the portal)  the portal turns off.  stan: (runs to the lever and tries to pull it to no avail) i just got him back! i can't lose him again! ah, come on! stanford! (echoes into the portal; voice-over from the present:) i'd lost him. i didn't know if he was dead or alive in some distant galaxy, but i knew his journal must have the answer to getting him back. somehow. (flips to the back of journal 1, where it says ""continued in journal #2""; cut to stan laying on the couch with journal 1 and ford's glasses at night) i didn't get much sleep that night. (looks at the glasses) or the night after that. (cut to stan with the lever and a screwdriver) i tried for weeks to turn that dumb machine back on. but without the other two journals (the machine emits a few sparks, then dies) it was hopeless. (cut to stan walking down the street) finally i ran out of food. i had no choice but to go into town. (walks into the dusk 2 dawn; cut to him with a loaf of bread at the cash register)  ma: just the bread, then, there, stranger? that'll be 99 cents.  stan: (looks into his pockets and pulls out a packet of sugar, a paper clip and a peso)  susan: hey, that's no stranger. that must be the mysterious science guy that lives in the woods!  a crowd gathers.  stan: (in flashback:) uh, n-no, no. you've got the wrong guy. (pulls his hood tighter)  toby determined: i've heard strange stories about that old shack.  daryl blubs: yeah! mysterious lights and spooky experiments.  pa: gosh, i'd pay anything to see what kind of shenanigans you get up to in there.  susan: oh, me too! do you ever give any tours?  stan: no. really i- (looks at hand, then sighs) yes, i do give tours! ten... nah-no... fifteen bucks a person!  crowd cheers and holds up money.  susan: sir! what did you say your name was, you man of mystery?  stan: oh, uh, stan...ford. stanford pines. (cut to stan leading a tour into the house) step right up, folks, uh, to a world of... enchantment, or whatever. (with a box with a dial and two antennae on it) behold, the um, nerdy science box.  susan: (looks at it and it burns her eye) ah! my eye!  stan: uh, i can assure you, that is in no way permanent.  susan: i paid fifteen dollars for this!?  crowd begins muttering.  stan: uhh... (grabs the skeleton and some clothing) you're lucky you weren't part of the last tour group, um, (shows them the skeleton, which he has dressed as a tourist) they never made it out aliiiivve. heheh. right?  the crowd laughs.  susan: that's funny.  stan: (montage of stan putting up signs, making attractions, selling merchandise. voice-over from the present:) so i came up with a plan. i couldn't leave my brother's house until i figured out how to save him, but i needed to pay his mortgage somehow. for once in my life, people were actually buying what i was selling. and so the murder hut was born! later renamed the mystery shack. finally i found something i was good at. for once being a liar and a cheat paid off. the old me was dead, and i'd faked a car crash to prove it. by day i was stanford pines: mr. mystery. but by night i was down in the basement, trying to bring the real stanford back. (cut to stan seeing a tour out, then going into the basement and looking at the portal. cut back to the present) i couldn't risk anyone learning the truth and sabotaging my mission, so i lied to everyone: the town, my family, your parents, even you kids.  dipper: so all this time you were just trying to save your brother. grunkle stan, i'm so sorry i didn't believe you.  stan: that's okay, kid. i probably wouldn't have believed me either.  agent: (from upstairs:) i heard talking! it was coming from downstairs!  stan: oh no, it's too late, the agents are comin' for us!  mabel: what do we do?!  soos: aw, man. i was so spellbound by your dramatic tale i forgot all about those dudes.  dipper: wait, forget. that's it! i think i know a way we might be able to defeat those agents! (takes a memory erasing gun out of a bag and gives it to stanford)  ford: of course! i don't know how you got a hold of one of these but, this is perfect! if i can just amplify the signal to a radio headset frequency... (plugs some wires into the gun and looks through some viewing glasses to see the agents running into the shack) there. now everyone plug your ears! get down! now!  everyone crouches and plugs their ears. cut to agent powers and trigger at the doorway.  agent trigger: sir! looks like there's a hidden door behind the vending machine!  powers: excellent! get me washington on line 1! i've been practicing sounds of excitement for this very occasion. hey, do you hear that?  a wave pulses through the shack and yard.  powers: what? where am i? why am i standing in front of some sort of goofy fun knick-knack house?  ford: (comes to the porch) stand down, gentlemen! i've been sent with the latest intel from washington. (flipping through some of mabel's drawings) according to this very real report, the power surges in gravity falls were actually due to radiation from an unreported meteor shower. a total embarrassment for your whole department. luckily i'm here to take this mess off your hands, but i'll need of all your... floppy disks, and 8-tracks...right?  powers: uh, everything about this case is contained on this drive.  trigger: (hands ford a flash drive labeled ""pines"")  ford: well, what are you waiting for, a kiss on the cheek? get out of here before i have your butts court-martialed!  powers: uhh, yes sir. apologies, sir. (whistles) false alarm, everyone! (trips on his way back to the car)  the government agents all leave. ford gives gompers the flash drive, and the goat runs away with it in his mouth.  mabel: (runs out with dipper) great uncle stanford, that was amazing!  stan: (follows with soos) let's not go crazy; it was serviceable.  ford: (chuckles) thank you, kids, but please, call me ford.  dipper: sure! thanks, great uncle ford. so, uh, (holds up a pen and notepad and clicks pen excitedly) would you mind if i ask you a couple billion questions about gravity falls?  ford: um, well i-uh...  stan: all right, kids, it's been a long day and me and my brother have a lot to talk about. why don't you hit the hay, huh?  dipper: but, it's the author! (clicks pen rapidly) i've been waiting so long to ask questions about-  stan: (grabs dipper and mabel's heads and pushes them away) i said. hit. the hay!  soos: i'll just... let myself out. (sidesteps away, and when he's out of sight the beeping of a phone can be heard; offscreen:) wendy, i've got something amazing to tell you. clear the next fourteen hours!  cut to night. stan and ford are looking at themselves in the mirror.  stan: look at us. when did we become old men?  ford: you look like dad.  stan: ugh, uck, don't say that.  ford and stan: (laugh)  ford: (sighs) okay, stanley, here's the deal. you can stay here the rest of the summer to watch the kids. i'll stay down in the basement and try to contain any remaining damage. but when the summer's over, you give me my house back, you give me my name back, and this mystery shack junk is over forever. you got it?  stan: you really aren't gonna thank me, are you? (beat) fine. on one condition: you stay away from the kids; i don't want them in danger. cause as far as i'm concerned, they're the only family i have left. (walks upstairs, stops, starts to look back, then keeps walking)  cut to dipper and mabel in their room. mabel is standing by the door.  mabel: did you hear what they said? i think grunkle ford said they're gonna buy us puppies made of ice cream. might be wishful thinking, though.  dipper: i don't know if this is good or bad. i wanted to meet the author, but...  mabel: (sits on her bed) yeah. i liked the way things were here before. just us and stan and the occasional goblin-monster.  dipper: eh, i'm sure they'll work things out.  mabel: dipper, you don't think we'll turn out like stan and ford, do you?  dipper: well. what do you mean?  mabel: (lays down) i mean, they used to be best friends, but then they got all stupid. can you promise me you won't get stupid?  dipper: i'm not stupider than you, dum-dum.  mabel: (laughs) good night, stupid.  dipper: good night, stupid. (turns light off and closes eyes)  mabel: (looks up nervously)  end credits: wendy is sitting up in her bed at 3 in the morning with soos on the phone.  soos: okay, okay, so it turns out that the second stan, the stan that, we know, was actually, stanley but the first stan, was stanford, but we didn't know, until, that stanford came out of the portal, which was built by stanford, but then stanley pretended to be stanford, he, did the portal, cause he's stan, but he's not stan.  wendy corduroy: soos, it's three in the morning.  soos: okay, okay, i understand. anyway, act two: stan started...  wendy: (groans and lays back on her bed)  end"

(punches it and it drops off his hand crawls around the room)  dipper: what is it?!  mabel: can we keep it?  stan: (hitting it with a rolled up newspaper) kill it! kill it!  ford: (chases it into the corner) patience... and (when the cycloptopus' eye turns into a screaming mouth) gotcha! (shocks it with his gloves and holds up its burnt body)  stan: great. now get it outta here. it smells like if death could barf.  dipper: (runs over to ford with journal 2) great uncle ford! you need any help with that? i've read all about these creatures in your journal, and i think i know how to--  ford: no! i'm sorry, dipper, but the dark weird road i travel, i'm afraid you cannot follow. well, call me for dinner! (closes the vending machine door behind him)  dipper: maybe next time then? or not? or never.  mabel: aww, dipper, don't take it so hard.  stan: (hits dipper with newspaper) no, do take it hard. take it hard and serious. my brother is a dangerous know-it-all, and the stuff he's messing with is even worse. do yourself a favor and stay away from him, you hear me?  dipper: but, grunkle stan, all summer long i've wanted to know who the author of the journal was. now the guy lives in our basement and i can't even talk to him.  stan: don't worry about what's in the basement. you belong up here with me and mabel.  mabel: yeah! besides, the season finale of duck-tective is airing this friday! that's all the mystery you'll need this week. quack with us, dipper! quack, quack quack quack...  stan: huha, yeah! quack quack, quack quack...  dipper: (as stan and mabel say ""quack,"" looks at light coming from behind the vending machine)  mabel: quack quack quack, a quack quack quaaaacck. quuaaaaa... (pointing at dipper) why isn't he quacking?  cut to theme song. cut to mabel writing in the living room.  mabel: (writing) dear mom and dad, we've been in gravity falls for a few months and so much has happened! just yesterday gravity reversed itself, almost destroying the universe and totally wrecking the whole town!

(opens game book) first, you roll a 38-sided die to determine the level of each player's statistical analysis poweroid. these orbs relate directly to the amount of quadrants that your team has dominion over, which is inverse to the anti-quadrants in your quadrant satchel.  mabel: and then we ride unicorns?  dipper: yes!  mabel: (gasps)  dipper: and no.  mabel: (frowns)  dipper: first, we make a graph.

(stomping on it) kill it! kill it!  mabel: dipper, could you maybe move this to another room?  ford: no dice! we ran out of room in the basement and we're going for a world record! now, dice! (rolls a 32) 32, yes! 7,000 points damage!  dipper: (laughing) you got me!  stan: oh, why, why with this? you wanna break a record, ford? you already got it with world's nerdiest old man.  ford: hey, at least i'm not all keyed up to watch a kid's show.  stan: i'll have you know that duck-tective has a big mystery element! and a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads!  grenda: i don't get a lot of it, but i like animals in human situations.  mabel: grunkle stan, it starts in a few minutes!  stan: (moves to take the paper off the tv)  ford: (grabs his hand) move that and pay the price!  stan: oh, what, fifty magical dwarf dollars?  ford: don't mock our fantastical monetary system!  stan: i'll mock all i want, it's my tv room!  ford: it's my house, you... (sighs) listen, stanley, did it ever occur to you to if you joined us you might actually have fun?  stan: what? now you listen to me! (takes ford's bag) as long as i live i will never...  dipper: grunkle stan, wait!  stan: ever...  ford: stanley!  stan: play your smartypants nerd game! (throws the bag to the floor, and the infinity sided dice rolls out)  ford: no!  four dungeons, dungeons, and more dungeons characters appear.  probabilitor: mortals of dimension 46'\, kneel before me and (rolls dice) snivel! i am probabilitor! the greatest wizard in all of mathology! give or take an error of 0.4.  stan: eh, is this normal?  dipper: have you come to send us on the quest of a lifetime because we're the smartest players you've ever met?  probabilitor: you are the smartest players i've ever met! that's why i'm going to eat your brains to gain your intelligence. it's what i do.  ogre: it's his thing.  dipper: what?!  probabilitor: seize them!  ford: (takes out a gun) your math is no match for my gun, you idiot!  probabilitor: math ray! (shoots a hole through the wall) i'm not here to play games! (grabs ford and dipper and flies out, followed by the other characters) now to the forest, for the ultimate game!  grenda: so, the room's free now. who wants to watch duck-tective? (squeaks duck-tective toy) nobody? more couch for grenda!  commercial break.  mabel: oh no! that crazy wizard is going to eat our brothers' brains! we have to stop 'em!  stan: eh, maybe let 'em get a couple bites in ford's brain first. even things out smartness-wise.  mabel: grunkle stan!  stan: alright, alright. i guess if we have no other choice, we'll go on a... (sighs) epic wizard quest.  mabel and grenda: yaaaayy!!  stan: everyone grab a weapon.  stan finds a bat in the couch cushion, mabel takes a rake, and grenda lifts up a chair.  grenda: heh. nice!  mabel: we're coming for you, dipper! and great uncle ford! and possibly that hot elf, if he's got anything to do with this.  they run off into the forest. cut to probability with dipper and ford, who are tied to a tree.  probabilitor: heheheh. (measures the pines' heads) with each brain i eat, i shall increase my enchantelligence.  ford: if my hands were free, i'd break every part of your face.  probabilitor: the time has come! hot elf! ready the brain-cooking pot!  hot elf: (sighs) yes, probabilitor. (shakes his hair and shoots a flaming arrow at the pot)  cut to grenda, mabel, and stan walking through the forest.  stan: (slaps his back) we must be getting close. these fairy bites are getting more frequent.  fairy: (crushed against stan's suit) hey, look, listen.  ogre: (stomps in front of them) halt! yon interlopers are trespassing on the ancient forest of probabilitor the wizard! if ye wish to pass, first, ye must complete seven unworldly quest, each, more difficult than the--  grenda: now! (hits him on the head with the chair and he collapses)  mabel: (pokes his foot with the rake) is he... dead?  stan: he's magic, sweetie. i'm sure he's fine. (to grenda:) there's no cops in the forest. we take this to our graves. (exchanges winks with her)  cut back to probabilitor.  probabilitor: heheheheh.  dipper: what do we do? what do we do?  ford: stop thinking, dipper! the more wrinkly your brain gets, the more he'll want to eat it!  probabilitor: and now, a little math problem: when i subtract your brain from your skulls (hits ford and dipper with his staff), add salt, and divide your family, what's the remainder?  mabel: (from behind the bushes) your butt!!  probabilitor: what? my butt isn't part of this particular equation.  grenda, mabel and stan: (jump out of the bushes)  probabilitor: drat! how did you make it past my one guard? very well. there's only one way your family can save you. you must defeat me in dungeons, dungeons, and more dungeons: real life edition! (creates a gameboard) hahaha-hahaha!  stan: what? oh, come on!  probabilitor: i choose my characters...(two ogres appear in the game) vs... (dipper and ford appear as elf characters in his hand) yours...  ford: ah! my ears! they're so pointy!  dipper: there better be something protective under this tunic. (turns around and opens tunic) oh, no, there isn't!  stan: seriously, can't we just, like, arm wrestle or something?  probabilitor: come on, this game is a lot of fun. i had my mom pack me a lunch. (takes some apple slices out of a paper bag) ew, apple slices? i'll eat you last.  stan: uh, just make with the rules, ugly. (chews gum)  probabilitor: the game is a battle royale. we help our characters by casting spells determined by rolls of the dice. if you win, i'll go back to my own dimension.  mabel: (claps)  probabilitor: but if i win, i eat their brains.  dipper: hey, i'm not sure this is such a good--  stan: deal!  dipper: oh boy.  probabilitor: let the game... begin! (rolls a 13) attack! (the ogres try to hammer dipper and ford with their clubs)  dipper: (running away) ah! whoa!  ford: ah!  stan: what do we do? what are our moves?!  dipper: there are no moves; you make them up!  stan: what? really?  ford: yes! i tried to tell you: this game involves math, but also risk, and imagination!  stan: risk?  mabel: imagination? grunkle stan, make something up! it's just like lying!  stan: i cast, uh... shield of... shielding! (rolls a 14 and a shield appears in front of dipper and ford) ha! we're doing it!  probabilitor: shield of shielding reversal spell.

(the sword gets longer)  dipper: (jumps over an ogre and kills it with the sword)  ford: (kills the other ogre with a sword)  probabilitor: no! drat you! you'll never outrun my (rolls dice) ogre-nado! (an ogre-nado chases dipper and ford) it is what is sounds like! (the ogre-nado blows dipper's and ford's swords away)  mabel: i cast: centaurtaur! yah! (rolls the dice and a horse with another horse body for a head appears)  stan: mabel, i am so confused and so proud right now.  dipper and ford get on the centaurtaur and it runs away from the ogre-nado.  mabel: go go go, dipper go! you can do it!  stan: (simultaneously:) come on, you guys! go! go!  the centaurtaur runs into a smaller room and disappears. the ogre-nado tries to follow but falls apart.  mabel: yeaahh!  stan: yes!  probabilitor: (the impossibeast picks up dipper and ford) hahaha yes! i was saving the worst for last!  dipper: oh no!  ford: the impossibeast! hey, i thought they banned this character!  probabilitor: think again! i'm playing the controversial 1991-1992 edition! (the impossibeast slams dipper and ford against the wall)  mabel: (shaking die) i'll think of some weapons!  ford: you don't understand. this is the most powerful monster in the game! he can only be defeated by rolling a perfect 38! but the odds of that are--  stan: (takes the die from mabel and shakes it) hey, long odds are what you want when you're a world class gambler! alright, stan, you can do this... papa needs a new pair of... twins! (throws the die and it lands on 38)  probabilitor: nooo!  stan: sorry, nerd-wizard. all your smarts are no match for dumb luck.  mabel: i cast death muffins! (muffins with dynamite sticking out of them appear in dipper and ford's hands)  dipper and ford: (throws the death muffins into the impossibeast's mouth)  impossibeast: huh? (explodes in muffins)  stan: yes!  mabel: yeeaah!  dipper and ford, holding muffins, appear next to them in their normal clothes.  mabel: (hugs dipper) hahaha!  hot elf: (with grenda hugging him, closes the rule book) the game is, like, over. excelci-whatever.  probabilitor: (disappearing with the game) no! i'm returning to my own realm! i'm turning into pure math! what are the ooooodddsss?? (disappears)  dipper: grunkle stan, that was amazing! how did you know you'd win?  stan: hey, a gambler never reveals his secrets. (picks up the die, which has gum stuck to the bottom and starts chewing some new gum)  mabel: man! that was fun for ages 8 to 80! or a million or however old you guys are!  stan: (to dipper:) y'know, i'm sorry for making fun of your game, kiddo. sure, it might be too nerdy for me, bust it's just the right amount of nerdy for you and my brother. if you two wanna hang out sometimes, i won't get in your way.  dipper: actually, after all that, i could use a little mindless fun.  grenda: guys! we can watch the second showing of duck-tective! it's not too late! (squeaks duck-tective toy)  cut to dipper, mabel, grenda, stan and soos in the living room at night watching duck-tective.  duck-tective: (on tv, on a hospital bed) wah, wah-wah. wah, wah-wah.

(subtitled:) time to finish the job... twin brother!  duck-tective: (terrified quack)  mabel: he had a twin brother all along? (pouring chips on stan) that's the big twist we've been waiting for!?  grenda: what a rip-off!  soos: i predicted that, like, a year ago.  cut to the basement.  ford: (locks the infinity-sided die away; to dipper:) this'll be here if you ever need it.  dipper: really? even though i got us into the whole game-playing mess?  ford: eh, we both got carried away. i guess we'd both gone for awhile without a friend. dipper, can i tell you something?  dipper: (nods)  ford: you asked me earlier what i was working on. well, (pulls curtain down to reveal the portal is gone) i dismantled the portal. an interdimensional gateway is too dangerous for the world it feeds into. that's why i was mad at stan for using it. he saved me but, as i feared, the instability of the machine created this: (holds up a transparent sphere with a blob in it) an interdimensional rift. i've contained it for now, but it's incredibly dangerous. dipper, i don't want you to tell anyone about this. not stan, not even your sister. you understand?  dipper: oh-uh, of course.  ford: in my time i've made many powerful enemies, but i trust you with this secret. now get yourself to bed. i have much research to do.  dipper: goodnight, great uncle ford.  ford: goodnight, dipper. (puts the rift away)  credits: soos, blubs, durland and toby determined are role-play fighting in the yard.  durland: guys, do you ever think that maybe we're doin' this 'cause our lives aren't special enough? that we use fantasy as an escape to avoid the self-improvement we all need? that maybe we should just go out and grow as people?  blubs: fortresses can't speak, durland.  durland: i'm a fortress!  griffin: (grabs toby and flies away)  blubs: does anyone want to rescue him?  durland: eh, i'm good.  soos: (simultaneously:) i'm kinda- i'm kinda tired. long day. long day of fclorping.  voice over: don't step to the wizard 'cause the wizard don't play nice- yeah!  end."

(turns to stan) we don't think you can do it.  stan: look, kids. the mayor kicking the bucket got me thinking. i'm an old man, and i'm not getting any younger. my dumb brother's research is probably gonna make him famous. and what do i have to show for my life? do i really want ""crooked grifter"" on my tombstone? how about, ""crooked mayor""!  dipper: psst, mabel, let's talk. (turns to mabel) i know stan isn't the best candidate. heck, he's committing voter fraud right now. (camera turns to show stan, stuffing in votes into his own ballot box) but bud's definitely up to something, and we're the only ones who can stop him.  mabel: you're right, dipper. besides, stan has a kind-of charisma. how hard could getting him elected be? (dipper takes off his pine tree cap and they both reach for matching hats and put on ""vote stan"" campaign stickers)   cut to the mystery shack, which now has a sign over ""mystery,"" reading ""mayorly shack."" there are several u.s. flags and ""vote stan"" signs all over. waddles is with wendy, who has written on waddles' body ""swines 4 pines"" on one side and ""bud's a dud"" on the other.  wendy: spread the word, pig! (waddles runs off)  dipper: alright everybody, eyes up here! (opens a rolled paper with a lot of dust coming out) okay, gravity falls elections are based on two events. the wednesday stump speech, held on an actual... stump, and the friday debate wherein townsfolk throw birdseed at the candidate they like most. at the end, they release a freedom eagle who will fly to the candidate covered in more seed and bestow a birdly kiss upon him anointing him mayor. (shows everybody the parchment, frowning; while rolling paper:) i couldn't make this up if i wanted to.  phone rings in the ""phone bank.""  mabel: okay grunkle stan, are you ready for your first radio interview?  stan: i got my mouth, don't i?  mabel: (on the phone:) okay you're on with the candidate.  voiceover: you're listening to falls radio: 24 hour news and bear rampage alerts, and now here's the t-man.  toby: hello! candidate stan first question: how do you feel about the american flag?  stan: meh, i can take it or leave it, too many stripes. next question.  cut to people at skull fracture listening to the radio broadcast and grunting with doubt.  toby: what would you do to help educate our kids?  stan: ha, simple. put them on an island and make them fight for dominance. (cut to a family listening to the radio; woman covers her daughter's ears) also teach kids swears. that'll bring them to the real world. (cut to mabel and dipper, who look at each other worriedly)  toby: what would you do about the crime in gravity falls?  stan: wait, do you mean crime in general, or just the specific crimes committed by m —  dipper: (the phone line is cut off when dipper cuts it with scissors) okay, interview's over. candy, what's the damage?  candy: your approval ratings started at zero. now it's a number lower than zero. (flips laptop around and shows stan's negative approval ratings)  wendy: you're meme-ing fast, and none of them are good. (shows her phone, which has a meme of stan on it that says: one does not simply ""teach kids swears"")  mabel: look grunkle stan, people are like smell markers, and you're black licorice! it's not that you're un-sniffable, you just need to learn when to keep the cap on.  dipper: from now on, maybe you should read our prepared remarks. (holds up a folded piece of paper with ""your speech"" written on it with drawings by mabel)  stan: heh heh. sorry kids. i always say words that come out of my brain. if my head says, that lady's got an ugly baby, my mouth says, ""whoa, lady, you got one ugly baby.""  (dipper and mabel look at each other worriedly; cut to basement, where dipper is pacing around)  dipper: and he's insisting on speaking his mind!  ford: so this is an emergency.  dipper: the stump speech is in a couple of days, and if he continues like this, we'll lose to bud for sure!  ford: hmm. it's a shame there isn't some device that will allow you to control someone else. oh. wait. of course, yes. there is. (shows dipper a striped tie) a long time ago i designed a prototype for ronald reagan's masters. just get stan to wear this, and you can make him a literal talking head.  dipper: (peers inside the tie) whoa! this is amazing! and ethically ambiguous!  ford: (takes out another tie that is darker) as long as you wear the matching one, he'll say and do whatever you want him to.  dipper: (holds up both ties) thank you great uncle ford! (runs off)  ford: yes, yes. use it responsibly and all.  cuts to the mystery shack, where dipper and mabel are testing out the ties.  soos: (puts on the tie) whoa, thanks for the slamming tie, dudes! these stripes are so slimming!  mabel: (turns to dipper) you really think this mind-controlling tie is gonna work?  dipper: (takes out other tie) flip the switch and test it out! (mabel puts it on and flips the switch)  mabel and soos: (singing and dancing) oh-oh-oh! i'm a dancing dude! i got some fancy moves and a bad attitude!

(mabel flips the switch on again)  mabel and soos: i am soos-tron! watch me eat this pine cone! (mabel mimics eating a pine cone while soos actually eats one, and mabel then flips the switch off; soos collapses onto his hands and knees, panting again)  mabel: mind control is awesome!  soos: (still panting) oh my gosh! my life just flashed before my eyes! aghh!  cut to tyler giving a stump speech. a sign hangs across two trees saying: ""general mayoral stumpston speeches"")  tyler: education, get it. prosperity, get it. a gravity falls we can be proud of, get iiiiit! (audience claps)  stan: (looks at tie) ugh. do i really have to wear this thing? it looks like a flag threw up on me.  mabel: grunkle stan, just trust your lucky tie.  blubs: and now, stanford pines!  mabel: (pushes stan towards the stage) you're on, grunkle stan! (slips on the mind control tie; turns to dipper) okay, we'll only jump in if he starts doing badly.  stan: (enters through the curtains) hiya there! stan pines here. let's get real. do you think the women of gravity falls wear too much makeup?  dipper: jump in! jump in!  mabel: (turns on the switch)  stan: uh, what i meant to say was: you ladies all look great. and have you done something with your hair? girl, you are working it! (snaps his fingers)  woman: (nodding with approval) yes!  girl with bow: that is exactly what i needed to hear right now.  stan: whew! (wipes forehead) i'm stan pines. you may know me as the guy who accidentally let all those bees loose in that elementary school a few years back. (dipper quickly pulls the tie off of mabel and puts it on, gaining control of stan)  stan: but i believe in things. america. freedom. ameri-freedom!  america guy: good! he's saying all the right things! (eyes fill with tears; grabs the people beside him)  stan: like my opponent pointed out, i may not have a pretty face, but if you want a candidate that will listen to you, well, i'm proud to be all ears. (crowd cheers; mabel takes control of stan) now, watch me break it down! (break dances then falls to the ground; the control goes off and stan walks off stage, scratching his head in confusion)  mabel: grunkle stan, that was amazing! (hugs stan)  soos: yeah! how'd you do it, mr. pines?  stan: eh, i don't know. i just opened my mouth and spoke from the heart, or... gut, or something. and what is that sound? why are people jamming their hands together?  mabel: it's applause! grunkle stan, they love you!  stan: they... love... me? (pushes the curtain away to see the crowd cheering)  crowd: (chants) stan! stan! stan! stan! (america guy rips his shirt open, revealing a bald eagle tattoo)  toby: there he is! mr. pines, can we get a picture?  dipper, mabel, stan and soos: (all pose) yes we stan!  toby takes their picture as a montage shows the twins continue to mind control stan. newspapers shown that stan eventually gets the town's support and takes the lead. cut to bud slamming the newspaper down in frustration.  bud: gah! darn it! gosh hand huckleberry honey suckle darn it! erm, excuse my language i'm so sorry. (pulls out a pamphlet and starts to wipe himself with it) oh, this is bad! this is real bad! i need to speak with my campaign manager, please excuse me for a moment. (goes to another room then faces a screen and takes his hat off) look, i'm sorry about all this. this is a minor setback, but... we'll win. i'm sure of it. (a camera then moves towards him)  gideon gleeful: minor setback?

(draws on a map of his lab) all i have to do is place moonstones here, here, and here, sprinkle some mercury, let's see... i always forget the last ingredient! (takes out journal 1 and flips through it) ugh, unicorn hair.  dipper: that's not, like, rare, is it?  ford: it's hopeless. (looks at journal 1; adjusts his glasses) unicorns reside deep within an enchanted glade, and their hairs can only be obtained by a pure good-hearted person who goes on a magical quest to find them.  mabel: (screams) grunkle ford, can i please go on this quest? i am literally obsessed with unicorns! my first word was ""unicorn,"" i once made my own unicorn by taping a traffic cone to a horse's head. (cut to a photo that reads ""banned from petting zoo"" and has a picture of mabel near a disgruntled horse with duct tape and a traffic cone on its head) are you even looking at the sweater i'm wearing right now?! not to mention that i'm probably the most pure of heart person in this room.  ford: that's true, she has a point.  dipper: (talking over ford:) i can't argue there.  mabel: so can i go on a mission to get that hair? please please please? i'll give you my blood!  ford: very well. but it won't be easy. (gives mabel journal 1) take this. (hands mabel a crossbow) and this.  mabel: oooh!  ford: i haven't been in this dimension for a while. it's okay to give children weapons, right?  mabel: pssh, come on, dawg. (fires the crossbow through the window, setting off stan's car alarm)  stan: (off-screen:) ah! it's the cops! gun it! (drives away accompanied by the sound of pugs yapping)  mabel: (to phone:) candy, grenda, wendy, clear the afternoon! (runs off)  dipper: so, what are the odds she gets that hair?  ford: unlikely. i've dealt with unicorns before, and if i had to describe them in one word it would be... frustrating.  dipper: so, what are we gonna do about bill?  ford: follow me.  dipper changes the sign on the mystery shack to ""closed."" dipper and ford get into the elevator and get out onto the second floor.  ford: welcome to my private study, a place where i keep my most ancient and secret knowledge. even your uncle stan doesn't know about this place. (as dipper stops to investigate a rectangular object covered by a sheet) dipper, come along! if we can't bill-proof the shack, we're going to have to do the next best thing. (holds up a helmet with wires on it) we're gonna have to bill-proof our minds.  dipper: (gasps)  cut to mabel, candy, grenda and wendy in the woods.  mabel: it's nice to finally be out on a mission, just us gals!  grenda: forget the gal talk! i'm here to meet, touch, and/or become a unicorn!  candy chiu: i hear if you lick a unicorn's neck, it tastes like your favorite flavor in the world!  mabel: candy, i will make sure you lick that unicorn's neck, because i care about my friends.  wendy corduroy: honestly, i stopped believing in unicorns when i was like, five years old. i'm just coming along to keep you kids from walking into a bear trap.  mabel: stop! this is the magic part of the forest. (opens journal 1) let's see, the gnome tavern is over there, the fairy nail salon is over there, but it says that to summon the unicorn, one must bellow this ancient chant droned only by the deepest-voiced druids of old.  grenda: (takes the journal) on it! oy-oyoy-oyoyoyoy...  wendy: i bet you ten bucks nothing happens.  mabel: i'll take that bet.  mabel and wendy </th><th><b>(gasps)</b> </th></tr>, <th><b>(gasps)</b> </th>, <tr> <th>: a fortress rises out of the ground. mabel, candy, grenda and wendy enter it.  mabel: the paintings airbrushed on the sides of vans were true!  celestabellebethabelle: (neighs)  grenda: mother of mothers!  candy: queen of dreams!  wendy: no way.  mabel: (reaches her hand up towards wendy and makes a grabbing motion) eh, eh.  wendy: (gives her a ten-dollar bill and sighs)  commercial break. cuts to the four girls looking at the unicorn while a faun plays a pan flute nearby. the unicorn rears her head.  celestabellebethabelle: hark! visitors to my realm of enchantment!   </th><th>both mabel and candy gasp and while grenda is doing the same thing a butterfly flies straight into her mouth causing her to gag. </th></tr>, <th>both mabel and candy gasp and while grenda is doing the same thing a butterfly flies straight into her mouth causing her to gag. </th>, <tr> <th>mabel: oh my gosh, oh my gosh! what's your name?  celestabellebethabelle: i am celestabellebethabelle, last of my kind. come in, come in. just, take off your shoes. i have a whole thing about shoes.  candy, grenda and mabel: (take off their shoes)  celestabellebethabelle: ah, ah! i'm talking to everyone!  wendy: (grudgingly takes off her shoes)  mabel: celestabellebethabelle, we have journeyed far and wide--  grenda: about an hour!  mabel: on a mission to protect our family with your magical hair!  candy: (standing next to celestabellebethabelle) this is your chance, candy. lick the neck. lick it... (tries to lick it but fails as celestabellebethabelle stands her neck straight up)  celestabellebethabelle: very well. to receive a lock of my enchanted hair, step forth, girl of pure perfect heart.  mabel: presenting: bum buh da bum bum ba bum bum! (kneels) mabel!  celestabellebethabelle: what? you? a unicorn can see deep inside your heart, child. (points at mabel with her horn and her chest glows with a heart)  mabel: ugh! (covers her chest)  celestabellebethabelle: and you have done wrong. wrong i say!  mabel: i guess i do make fun of dipper a lot. and i did just shatter a window with a crossbow.  celestabellebethabelle: your bad deeds make me cry. (her eyes well up, and a tear lands on a flower, killing it)  mabel: nooo!  celestabellebethabelle: come back when you're pure of heart. neeeiiggghh! exit is that way. shoes, shoes, take your shoes. this isn't some... some... shoe store.  the humans leave and the gate closes.  grenda: hey, mabel, don't let her get to you.  wendy: yeah, i wouldn't trust a horse that wears makeup.  mabel: no, girls, she's right. i used to be one of the sweetest people i knew, but recently i've been slacking in the whole goodness department. well, today we're gonna fix it. from this moment forth i'm gonna do so many good deeds, i'll have the purest heart in gravity falls! (pumps fist in the air and accidentally punches a bird out of the air which opens wendy's, candy's, and grenda's mouth as a form of minor shock for mabel accidently punching that bird) that... that bird is fine.  cut to ford's lab. ford hooks dipper up to the mind machine.  dipper: so what is bill, exactly?  ford: no one knows for sure. accounts differ of his true motivations and origins (around this time dipper picks up ""the cipher file"" and starts reading it). i know he's older than our galaxy and far more twisted. without a physical form, he can only project himself into our thoughts through the mindscape. that's why he wants this. (holds up interdimensional rift) i dismantled the portal, but with this tear, bill still has a way into our reality. to get his hands on this rift, he would trick or possess anyone.  dipper: so how do we keep bill out of our minds?  ford: well, there's a number of ways. i personally had a metal plate installed in my head.  dipper: heheh. good one.  ford: (knocks the side of his head, making a metallic sound)  dipper: (coughs and clears his throat)  ford: but this machine is safer. it will scan your mind, bioelectrically encrypting your thoughts so that bill can't read them. (turns it on) now say hello to your thoughts.  dipper: (on machine:) oh, man, i can't believe i'm with the author. is my fly down? (singing:) disco girl! coming through! (talking:) wendy. wendy. wendy. wendy. (speaking to ford:) you might wanna... ignore that last one. by the way, you never told me what your history with bill was.  ford: dipper, do you trust me?  dipper: well, yeah, but-  ford: then you'll trust that that's not important. now, focus. it's time to strengthen your mind.  cut to candy, grenda, mabel and wendy on the sidewalk.  mabel: alright, mabel, it's time to strengthen your heart.  montage: mabel picks snails off the sidewalk and puts them on large grass. mabel digs a hole and grenda puts a tree in it. toby determined tries to come outside but the tree has blocked his door. mabel puts a giant smiley face sticker on stan's face. he screams and breaks his lamp in the process. mabel donates three pints of blood, then faints. mabel stops traffic for some ducks to cross, paints glitter on the statue of nathaniel northwest, fills lazy susan's tip jar, and she, candy, grenda, and wendy help a woman with her groceries.  singer: (over montage) share a smile! dream a dream! doing some good deeds! share a smile! plant a tree! doing some good deeds! halt! and smile! love them tight! doing good deeds!   mabel: (looking at a checklist of good deeds) boom! a thousand good deeds (accompanied by candy, grenda, and wendy's cheering which semi-drowns out mabel's dialogue)  mabel: when that unicorn scans my heart, she's gonna say i'm absolutely, one hundred percent, bona fide-  cut to celestabellebethabelle's fortress.  celestabellebethabelle: not pure of heart.  mabel: booyah! wait, what?  wendy: how is that even possible? mabel's a straight up saint, you judgmental hoofbag!  mabel: please, tell me what i'm doing wrong!  celestabellebethabelle: doing good deeds to make yourself look better isn't good at all. not to mention you're crushing, like, ten dandelions right now. those are basically children's dreams.  mabel: (gets off the dandelions and gasps)  celestabellebethabelle: i'm sorry, mabel. it's not my fault you're a bad person.  candy, grenda and wendy: (gasp)  mabel: (runs off crying)  wendy: mabel, wait! come back!  celestabellebethabelle: now if you'll excuse me, i have a 3 o'clock posing in front of a rainbow. (poses in front of a rainbow) neigheigheigheigheigheigh.  cut to mabel lying down outside. candy, grenda and wendy walk up to her.  wendy: come on, mabel. don't beat yourself up about this.  candy: let's forget about getting that dumb unicorn hair.  mabel: it's not about the hair anymore, guys. it's about me. being kind and sweet is what makes me who i am. if i'm not a good person, who am i? i'm not leaving this spot until i think of a deed that makes me as good as celestabellebethabelle.  candy: but, mabel...  mabel: just leave me be.  wendy: pst. (ushers candy and grenda away) guys, if you ask me, this whole thing is a serious load. mabel's like the best person i've ever met. we tried getting that hair the good way. now it's time we try the wendy way (wendy then punches and rubs her left fist against her right hand as a way of signaling a violent gesture)  grenda: are you suggesting violence? sabotage?  candy: mabel's not going to like that.  wendy: mabel doesn't need to know. look, it's time we stop trying to be so ""perfect"" and be who we really are. we're crazed, angry, sweaty animals! we're not unicorns, we're women! and we take what we want! (punches a tree which brings a couple of leaves down to the ground)  candy and grenda: yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah!  grenda: (smashes a rock on her head) too much?  wendy: here's what we're gonna do.  cut to gnasty's.  gnome: get me a flaggon of your daintiest honeysuckle, please.  bartender: i'm gonna need to see some id.  wendy: (kicks the door open)  gnome 2: it's the cops! hit the deck (accompanied by another gnome flinging himself out the window)  wendy: i'm lookin' for someone who knows how to take down a unicorn! no tricks or games!  candy: (smashes a bottle) we are human! we take what we want!  grenda: yeah!  gnome 3: fairy dust. a whole magic bag's enough to put a unicorn out cold. but if i do you a favor, you gotta do somethin' for me.  grenda: just, spill it, half-pint (accompanied by her slamming her fist against a tree stump  gnome 3: butterfly trafficking is illegal in this part of the forest, but i like butterflies. they tickle my face and make me laugh. bring me a bag of butterflies and we got a deal.  grenda and wendy: (nod)  cut to a net grabbing a butterfly. cut back to gnasty's. grenda approaches the gnome and gives him the bag of butterflies.  gnome 3: two bags of fairy dust, just like we agreed.  grenda: where do you get this stuff?  gnome 3: everyone likes sausage, but no one likes to know how it's made.  grenda: you disgust me.  gnome 3: you got your poison; i got mine; we made a deal.  grenda: yeah, well, the deal is off!  several policemen gnomes run out of the bushes.  policeman: freeze! you're under arrest! get down! get down!  gnome 3: these butterflies aren't mine! i swear! i've been framed!  policeman: tell it to the adorable owl we've dressed as a judge. (to grenda:) my cut.  grenda: (gives him one of the bags)  cut to mabel.  mabel: (writing in her notepad) good deeds. good deeds. aww that's not good enough! come on, mabel, you can do better than that!  candy, grenda and wendy: (enter celestabellebethabelle's house)  celestabellebethabelle: (reading whinny, pray, trot) oh sure, sure, i wish i could travel, but it's just not feasible in this economy- (gets hit with the fairy dust) what the hey?! (faints)  faun: (nervously plays s.o.s in morse code on pipes)  grenda: (puts a towel over its mouth) sleep now! sleeeeep. (pulls the faun away as it loses consciousness)  wendy: (takes scissors and some of celestabellebethabelle's hair)  mabel: (enters the fortress) no wait! stop!  wendy: mabel! shh! you'll wake her up!  mabel: (takes scissors) but this is wrong, guys!  wendy: but protecting the shack is good.  celestabellebethabelle: (gets up and sees mabel with the scissors) what? doth mine eyes deceive me? thief! you shall never be pure of heeeaart!  mabel: no! you don't understand! i just want to be good like you!  blue unicorn: (offscreen:) whoa, whoa, whoa, you gotta be kidding me. (enters with the red unicorn) yo, c-beth, are you seriously pulling this ""pure of heart"" scam again?  red unicorn: that is messed up, man.  mabel: wait, scam?  red unicorn: kid, unicorns can't see into your heart. all our dumb horns can do is glow, point towards the nearest rainbow and play rave music. (plays music)  blue unicorn: yeah, the whole ""pure of heart"" racket is just a line we use to get humans to leave us alone.  celestabellebethabelle: guuuyys. shut uuupp.  mabel: (crushes notepad) all this time. all this time i thought i was a bad person. but you're even worse than i am! (throws the notepad with ""mabel's sins"" written on it to the ground)  candy, grenda and wendy: (gasp)  celestabellebethabelle: okay, fine. so you learned our secret. we're jerks, okay? we have more hair than we know what to do with, and we keep it to ourselves just to tick humans off. (mockingly:) what are you gonna do about it, huh, huh? what are ya gonna do?  mabel: (punches celestabellebethabelle)  celestabellebethabelle: oh!  candy, grenda and wendy: (gasp)  wendy: whoo! go mabel!  grenda: join the dark side!  mabel: (growls and tears the unicorn image off of her sweater)  candy, grenda and wendy: fight! fight! fight!  celestabellebethabelle: oh. so it's a fight you want. well, then it's a fight you're gonna get!  the humans and the unicorns run at each other. cut to ford's lab, where a screen says ""scanning thoughts 15%.""  dipper: ugh, this is taking forever. how long have i been doing this for? (sees that ford is asleep) why does he have to be so mysterious about bill? i can handle the truth. (thoughts on machine:) i wonder what great uncle ford is thinking. use the machine! it'll show you his thoughts. (speaking:) i shouldn't... (on machine:) he won't know. he's going to tell you eventually. the more you know about bill, the more you can help. (speaking:) man, i am really good at rationalizing. (on machine:) yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are; yes, you are. (puts the helmet on ford's head; speaking:) just a little peek. what are you hiding about bill?  bill appears on the screen, cackling. screen changes to stanford moving around in his sleep. smaller screens show the portal and fiddleford mcgucket yelling at ford.  mcgucket: where are these ideas coming from? who are you working with?!  screens change to ford writing ""i'm losing,"" ""my mind,"" and ""trust no one"" in the journal.  stan: (voice on machine:) my brother is a dangerous know-it-all...  ford: (on machine:) he would trick or possess anyone... (as a young man:) then it's a deal. from now until the end of time.  bill: (holding out hand, which is on fire) just let me into your mind, stanford.  ford: please, call me... (shaking hands) a friend.  bill: (possessing ford, cackling)  dipper: ford and bill?! (gasps)  ford: (stands up) you shouldn't have done that. (takes off helmet and throws it, knocking down a curtain, revealing many items depicting bill)  dipper: why- why were you shaking hands with bill? (picks up interdimensionsal rift) you said bill could possess anyone so he could get this. (the rift slips out of his hand, and he catches it) ahh!  ford: careful! hand me the rift! now, boy!  dipper: (backing away) why were you really scanning my thoughts? (aims memory erasing gun at ford) are you bill right now?!  ford: now just-just calm down, p-  dipper: (scared) pine tree?! is that what you were gonna call me?!  ford: i was just going to say ""please"", kid!  dipper: (stops at the end of the room) great uncle ford told me to protect the rift! get one step closer and i'll shoot! i'll erase you right out of ford's head!  ford: it's me, dipper. it's your uncle!  dipper: (charging gun) trust no one, trust no one, trust...  ford: hand it to me!  the gun fires at ford, but bounces off his glasses and around the room, finally destroying one of the screens.  dipper: (tries to pick up the memory erasing gun)  ford: (picks dipper up before he can get the gun)  dipper: (trying to hit him) let go of me!  ford: now-now just calm down. calm down! (adjusts his glasses) look into my eyes! look at my pupils. it's me, dipper. it's me. (sets him down)  dipper: (sighs) i tried to erase your mind. i'm so sorry.  ford: it's okay, dipper. besides, my mind can't be erased, anyway, remember? (knocks the side of his head) if i really was bill, though, you would've done great. i should of been more like you when i was young. dipper, i was a fool to try to hide all this. the reason i've been trying to prepare you for bill's tricks is that bill tricked me. it's the biggest regret of my life. bill wasn't always my enemy, dipper. i used to think he was my friend. long, long ago. (flashback to ford as a young man in front of a printer) i had hit a road block in my investigation of gravity falls. (punches the drawing of the question mark he had made on his chalkboard; cut to him in a cave) until i found some mysterious writing in a cave. ancient incantations about a being with answers. it warned me not to read them, but i was desperate. i read the inscription aloud. but nothing happened. until later that afternoon, when i had the most peculiar dream. (ford is sleeping under a tree. the knots on the trees become bill eyes and the rest of the backround fades into abstraction. journals and pages are floating about randomly. ford gets up and walks around.)  bill: (comes up behind him) hiya, smart guy! (circles around him) woah, don't have a heart attack, you're not 92 yet.  ford: (in flashback) who are you?  bill: name's bill! and your name's stanford pines, the man who changed the world, but i'm getting ahead of ourselves; let's relax! care for a game of interdimensional chess? (chessboard appears) have a cup of tea (teapot pours tea into a teacup).  ford: (voice-over from the present:) he told me he was a muse. that he chose one brilliant mind a century to inspire. what a fool i was. blinded by his flattery and games. he became my research assistant. he was free to move in and out of my mind as he pleased. (cut to ford summoning bill, who possesses him.) we were partners. (cut to ford and bill in the mindscape, doing an equation with a picture of the universe portal next to it) when he told me i could complete my research by building a gateway to other worlds, i trusted him. he said this was the way genius happened. little help from a friend. (cut to ford and mcgucket in front of the portal) it seems that i was on the verge of my greatest achievement! (the portal activates; cut to ford with mcgucket, who is unconscious) until my partner got a glimpse of bill's true plans. (cut to ford approaching bill) bill! you lied to me! where does that portal really lead?  bill: (looking at what looks like a scar in space with dark shapes in it) hoho! looks like mr. brainiac finally got smart! let's just say that when that portal finishes charging up, your dimension is gonna learn how to party! (to the scar:) right, guys?  roaring and cackling is heard from the scar.  ford: no! i'll stop you! i'll shut it down!  bill: a deal's a deal, sixer! you can't stop a bridge between our worlds from coming, but it would be fun to watch you try! cute even!  ford: (wakes up, shocked) i'd been betrayed. i shut the portal down, (cut to ford shutting the portal down) severing the link between bill's world and ours. i had to hide my instructions so no one could ever finish bill's work. (cut to the present) bill's been waiting for the gateway to reopen ever since. all he needs to do is get his hands on this rift. to bill, it's just a game, but to us, it would mean the end of our world.  dipper: oh, man.  ford: oh, man, indeed.  cut to dipper and ford in the living room drinking pitt cola.  dipper: ugh, i'm so embarrassed about earlier. i'm such an idiot.  ford: from now on, no more secrets between us. we're not the first two idiots to be tricked by bill, boy. but if we work together, we could be the last.  dipper: but what about bill? i broke the machine! now we have no way to protect the shack!  mabel: (slams the unicorn hair on the table) did someone say ""unicorn hair""?!  candy, grenda, mabel and wendy are behind her. they are all beat up and covered in unicorn fluids and tears.  dipper: uh, no, actually?  mabel: oh. that would have been perfect. either way we got some unicorn hair! (waves it in dipper's face)  candy: also some unicorn tears, unicorn eyelashes... (gestures to grenda, who has unicorn eyelashes)  grenda: they finally gave us this treasure just to get rid of us! (dumps treasure on table)  ford: it... can't be! this is a great day, girls! with this unicorn hair, we should be able to completely shield the shack from bill's mind-reading tricks!  mabel: is it okay?  ford: better than okay; it's perfect! you've protected your family. you're a good person, mabel.  mabel: thanks, grunkle ford, but today i learned that morality is relative.  stan: (runs in and grabs the treasure) money!! (runs away)  end credits: dipper and ford are in the yard. dipper finishes stretching the unicorn hair around the shack. a force field forms around the shack.  ford: perfect! this will protect us from bill! as long as we're inside, our minds are safe.  bill: (watching them from the mindscape) i guess i can't possess anyone inside the shack, so i'll just have to find my next pawn on the (voice gets lower:) outside.

35|gravity falls|Roadside Attraction|September 21, 2015|"episode opens with the mystery shack, to the back of grunkle stan's rv. grunkle stan puts a bumper sticker on it that says ""caution: silverfox at the wheel"" as soos helps pack it up.  stan pines: (hums) nice. and don't forget bug spray! it's perfect for spraying in the face of hitchhikers.  dipper pines: whoa. an rv? camping gear? are you running from the law again?  soos ramirez: (on top of rv) dude! it's the ultimate oregon road trip adventure!  stan: more like revenge trip. every year my tourist trap competitors prank the mystery shack. last year those hooligans duct taped soos to the ceiling.  soos: that was a fun 78 hours.  stan: well, no more! (pulls out a map of oregon's tourist traps and hands it to dipper) this year we're visiting every tourist trap along the redwood highway, and i'm gonna prank back every single one.  grenda: bow wow! time to let the road dogs bark!  candy chiu: that is us. we are the road dogs.  mabel pines: thanks for letting me bring candy and grenda along for our road trip, grunkle stan.  stan: the more the merrier. just sign these non-disclosure agreements. none of your parents are lawyers, right? (stan, candy, and grenda walk into the rv)  soos: (jumps down from the roof of the rv) what do ya say, dude? you comin'?  mabel: i already went to the trouble of packing all your stuff. even the stuff you kept in that secret box under the bed. (drops the box, pictures of wendy coming out of it) whoa. what the...? ugh, what's that?  dipper: (starts cleaning the pictures up) uh, nothing! just...wendy stuff...from old times.  mabel and soos: ughh.  mabel: bro, i thought you were finally past all this.  dipper: ahh, i know, i know! i know she's not interested and i know it's over, but how do you just turn off the way you feel about someone?  mabel: two words, dipper. move. on.  soos: yeah, dude. and a road trip's the perfect place to meet new people.  dipper looks at a picture of wendy, then at the pamphlet. he looks up into the sky and smiles.  (cut to theme song)  the rv bounds across the open road. stan is driving as soos pants with his tongue sticking out.  grenda: man, rvs are amazing. i can't believe we're sitting at a table in a moving vehicle!  candy: ooh! informational travel pamphlets. (pressing pamphlets to her cheeks) i want to read them all and gain their travel knowledge.  stan: kid, those useless pamphlets have never helped a single person. the only wrinkly old travel guide you'll need is me. now look alive! we're coming up on an attraction run by the most black-hearted proprietor in all of oregon.  cut to a sign outside granny sweetkin's yarnball. the rv pulls up next to it and stops.  stan: don't let the face fool you. this woman lit my car on fire on two non-consecutive occasions.  cut to outside the rv. the kids have gotten out and are staring at the yarn ball.  dipper, mabel, candy and grenda: whoa.  mabel: i'm going in, girls. waaah. (mabel goes inside the yarn. candy laughs and follows her.)  grenda: yarn! (goes inside the yarn)  a tourist girl walks by dipper.  dipper: okay. like soos said, meet new people. (walks up to girl and clears throat) so, uh...come here often?  unnamed tourist girl: no. i'm a tourist.  dipper: (laughs nervously) you're funny. and cute. i mean, not cute. i mean, you're not not cute. phew, let me start over. (extending hand) my name is dopper. (she dumps her ice cream in his hand and walks away as dipper sighs)  stan: (over the walkie talkie:) dipper, hup to! this ball a' yarn ain't gonna prank itself.  dipper takes a piece of the yarn ball from mabel and ties it to the back of the rv. he sighs.  stan: something on your mind, kiddo? you're thinking about miss cold shoulder over there, huh?  dipper: ahh, i'm so embarrassed. look, earlier this summer i ruined my chances with wendy.  as they talk, mabel and grenda pop out of the top of the yarn ball and high-five.  stan: heh, yeah. chances.  mabel and grenda begin unraveling the yarn ball behind them.  dipper: and i wanna move on, but i'm terrible at talking to girls. the moment i open my mouth around them i unravel like...like...well, i can't think of a perfect metaphor, but you get the gist. at this rate, i'm going to grow up to be a sad loner like toby determined.  stan: whoa. never say that about yourself. lucky for you i'm an expert on women. listen to me, kid. when it comes to girls always be confident. and be funny, but not too funny. and be kinda annoying but in a lovable way.  dipper: i don't know, grunkle stan. this sounds kinda jerky.  stan: hey, jerky is just a term non-jerks use to bad mouth innocent jerks. confidence, comedy, some third word starting with a c. the three cs of the stan pines dating technique! at the next tourist trap, try out my advice on the first girl you see.  dipper: cool. grunkle stan, thanks.  stan: hey, i'm full a good ideas. speakin' of which, everyone! now!  dipper, stan, and soos run into the rv. mabel, candy, and grenda get out of the yarn ball and follow them. the rv speeds away, unraveling the yarn ball completely.  granny sweetkin: why, you gall darn son of a no good. (takes a nail out of the ground and throws it at the rv) i'll get you, stan pines!  cut to upside-down town. the rv pulls up and stops.  stan: ah, upside-down town. the nausea capital of the state. whatever you do, don't use the bathrooms.  the kids put on shoes with velcro on the bottom, so they can walk on the carpeted ceiling.  mabel, candy and grenda: road dogs! woof, woof, woof!  the kids get aligned with the ceiling and walk into the house, laughing.  grenda: nice!  mabel: this is so weird!  dipper walks in as he notices emma sue.  stan: (in dipper's head:) alright, kid. this is it. be confident.  dipper: (clears throat) hi, i'm dipper. crazy place, right?  emma sue: oh, hi. i'm emma sue. you know, if you pretend we're right side up, it looks like everyone's hair is standing on end.  dipper: huh. yeah, weird, right? pretend you're screaming.  emma sue: okay. you gotta take a picture of me, though. (screams as dipper takes a picture with her phone)  dipper: let's see about--whoa! (he lets go of the phone before catching it) huh-hoh, just kidding. (laughs)  emma sue: (playfully:) you are the worst. (softly punches dipper)  dipper: you bet i am. i'm bad, emma. kind of a jerk.  emma sue's father: emma, come on! we have to get to canada before your mother gives birth!  emma sue: it's a long story.  dipper: maybe you could tell me sometime.  emma sue: here's my email address. write me and i'll tell you all about it. (writes her email on dipper's hand and walks away)  dipper: a girl gave me her email. and it wasn't out of pity! haha! yes! (jumps in the air and falls to the floor, landing next to mabel) i'm okay. i'm better than okay. mabel, hi. there's my grenda. candy, looking great, looking great. is that a new pair of glasses? very shiny. (candy blushes deeply) hahaha. wooo!  grenda: maybe it's the blood pooling in my head, but dipper seems different. (groans as her forehead turns purple)  candy: yes. good different.  stan: (off screen) now, soos!  stan and soos start jumping on the floor, rolling the house and turning it right-side up. the gang runs to the rv and drives away.  stan: not so upside-down now! (laughs)  civilian: what a lovely normal home!  upside-down town boss: stan pines!  dipper: (looks at emma's e-mail) i can't believe it worked. what do i do now? do i e-mail her?  stan: no, no, no. you practice. the more girls you talk to, the better you get at it.  dipper: grunkle stan, these tips are priceless.  stan: and that's just the tip of the advice-berg.  (a montage begins. dipper flirts with girls at log land and the corn maze as stan sabotages the attractions. soos walks into a random area of the corn maze as the rest of the gang runs back into the rv.)  stan: everyone on board?  mabel: probably.  the rv drives away, leaving soos behind.  soos: guys? hello? anyone? they'll come back for me.  cut to septic ridge rv park at night. dipper and stan are relaxing in a hot tub.  stan: so then i said to the bouncer, ""where's your id, ugly?"" (points to a scar on his under right arm) that's where i got this scar.  dipper: (laughs) grunkle stan, i gotta say this was one of the best days ever. look! (holds up arms with phone numbers on them)  stan: that's the stan pines method, kid. works every time.  dipper: i'm just a little worried, though. i mean is it bad to flirt with this many girls at once? i'm just tryin'a get over wendy. i don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.  stan: please. that's the best part 'a flirting on a road trip. you're not gonna see any of these gals again. to moving on! (stan and dipper laugh)  screen pans to mabel, grenda and candy sitting at a bonfire next to the rv, eating marshmallows and laughing.  mabel: okay, it's time for...  mabel and grenda: ...truth or dare or don't! (point at candy)  candy: i choose... don't!  grenda: ugh! you always choose don't.  candy: fine. uh, truth.  mabel: do you...like someone? (candy blushes)  grenda: uh-oh. someone's blushing.  candy: okay, maybe just a little. i don't know for sure. it just... started.  mabel and grenda: tell us! tell us!  candy: okay. it begins with a ""d"" and ends with an ""ipper.""  mabel: (shocked) no.  candy: yes.  mabel and grenda: (gasp)  mabel: ready, grenda? three. two. one. (mabel and grenda gasp before screaming loudly. dipper and stan look around.)  stan: man, coyotes sound a lot worse than i remember.  mabel: (giggling with grenda) candy. candy! all my life dreams are coming true right now. my brother. my best friend.  grenda: i can't breathe! i'm so excited i can't breathe! (falls backwards)  candy: i never really noticed him before, but he seems different lately. less sweaty, and more charming. but how do i approach him?  mabel: don't even worry about that, can-can. mabel's got a plan. (shoves marshmallows in her mouth) mabel's got a plan.  cut to the road. the rv is back on the highway.  stan: alright, campers. we got another day 'a breakin' laws and breakin' hearts. everything up until now has been a walk in the park compared to our next attraction.  mabel: is it a walk in the world's biggest park?  stan: eh, sort of. there she is, kids. mystery mountain. five times the size of the mystery shack, and what's worse: she has real attractions.  candy: oh! i have read about this place. it has sky tram. and a mummy museum. and sightings of half human, half spider creatures.  stan: even their made up legends are better than ours. today, the mountain falls.  mabel: (nods at grenda) question. the back seat makes me car sick. can i sit up front today?  grenda: also question. i'm the size of two people. can i have a whole seat to myself?  candy: (looks up from the pamphlet and blushes)  stan: eh, i don't know, sure.  mabel: (runs to shotgun seat) whooo! change up! (yells as she pushes dipper out of the seat and into the back seat)  dipper: but wait! that means it'll just be me and-- (looks at candy, who is sitting next to her)  candy: (blushing) candy chiu! 6th grade!  dipper: (jumps back) whoa! hey.  dipper and candy awkwardly sit in silence. after a few seconds, candy moves closer to dipper.  dipper: you're sitting close.  grenda: (giggles with mabel as she moves a curtain over the back seat)  candy: so, dipper. i was wondering, would you maybe want to walk around the mystery mountain with me today?  dipper: ssssure, i mean, wasn't that already the plan? (scoots away from candy)  candy: i mean, just us. you and me. candy and dipper.  dipper looks shocked as stan slams the brakes on the car, coming to a stop in front of the mystery mountain entrance. cut to stan outside the rv.  stan: alright, road dogs! i got five bucks for whoever can tip the big blue ox! go, go, go! (ushers mabel and grenda out)  candy: (to dipper:) i will see you in there! (giggles and walks away)  stan: hey, what's up with the mopey mug, kid?  dipper: stan! you gotta help me! everything you taught me worked too well! i think candy just asked me out on a date!  stan: he-hey! (punches dipper's shoulder) look at this little champion!  dipper: what? no! i-i mean, candy's great, she's sweet and she's smart, but i've never thought of her like that! th-th-this is all moving way too fast. (sits down, panting) okay. i just need to be honest with her and tell her i-i'm not ready for all this.  stan: (laughs and shakes his head) don't you see what's happening here? that's your dumb obsession with wendy gettin' in the way of your future! if you wanna move on, you've gotta say yes to whatever comes your way. (walks toward ticket booth and looks at darlene) speaking of which...  darlene grins at stan.  dipper: but i don't wanna lead her on!  stan: ah ah ah! watch and learn. (walks to ticket booth; searches pockets) oh, i seem to have lost my number! (flirt-like) can i borrow yours?  darlene: (laughs) you are a riot! what brings you here? we don't normally get men this handsome around these parts.  stan: heheh. well, (looks at name tag) darlene, between you and me, what i'm doing here is a little secret.  darlene: oh, you seem like a man with secrets. (laughs with stan)  dipper: ugh.  darlene: you know, i'm going on a break. you wanna take the sky tram up to widow's peak?  stan: (whispers to dipper) take my advice or don't, but clearly i know what i'm doing.  darlene: (takes stan's offered arm and walks to the entrance with him) oh, fancy!  stan: (turns his head back to dipper, grins, and points at darlene)  cut to mabel and grenda watching from the bushes as candy and dipper enter mummy town u.s.a.  mabel: oh! i can't believe this is happening. a real date! i wonder what they'll name the baby.  grenda: if i had a baby, i would name it grenda 2: the sequel!  mabel: you would make such a good mother.  cut to inside mummy town u.s.a. dipper and candy are sitting on a bench. a banner above them reads ""new mummies daily"".  candy: this place is so enchanting.  dipper: sort of confused by the phrase ""new mummies daily,"" though. i mean, how does that even work?  candy: this mountain is full of mysteries. like, why is my head falling on your shoulder? beeyooop. (giggles as she places her head on dipper's shoulder)  dipper: uh, yep! this is what i want! this is all part of the plan and stuff.  corn maze girl: oh, dipper! hey!  dipper: (gasps) corn maze girl!  corn maze girl: (sits on bench) i was wondering when you'd call.  candy: dipper, who is this?  dipper: nobody! i mean, uh, somebody, but--  emma sue: dipper! (walks up) i didn't recognize you right-side up. you'll never guess where my mom gave birth. hey, who are these girls?  log land girl: dipper? (appears from behind the corner) why haven't you called? did our romantic log ride mean nothing to you?  candy: i can't believe it. you agreed to go on a date with me and you were seeing all these other girls?  corn maze girl: well, answer us. which one of us do you like?  dipper: i... (begins to sweat) i like all of you! i mean, i don't like any of you! i mean-- (pulls hat over face) i was trying to learn how to talk to girls! (laughs awkwardly)  emma sue, log land girl, and corn maze girl walk away in disgust.  log land girl: unbelievable.  emma sue: so gross.  corn maze girl: what a jerk.  candy: dipper pines. (takes off glasses and rubs eyes) i thought you were a nice guy. but i guess you only care about yourself. (puts on glasses and walks away)  dipper: uh, candy, wait! ugh, i messed everything up. i gotta find stan! he'll know what to do! (runs away)  stan and darlene move to sit at a bench near the giant spider forest.  darlene: oh, are you sure you wanna go this deep into the forest? it's so scaaary.  stan: heh, don't worry, toots. (puts arm around darlene) that spider people stuff is just an urban legend. i can't believe people fall for it.  darlene: you're so brave.  stan: what can i say? i'm a real catch.  darlene: yes. (blinks as her eyes turn black and her voice distorts) the catch of the day.  the view pans up as darlene changes in size, stopping on a giant statue of a spider.  stan: uh, i think your contacts fell out-- (screams)  cut back to the mystery mountain entrance. dipper runs to the information stand.  dipper: (panting) uh, have you seen an old guy around here? uh, big ears, orange nose, a real know-it-all?  mystery mountain worker: (points to a fire retardant raccoon animatronic)  fire retardant raccoon: ah, ah, ah! flame retardant raccoon says: don't hug forest fires.  dipper: ughhh. (walks to entrance) stan, where are you? i need your advice! (hears static from the walkie-talkie and takes it out) grunkle stan?!  stan: (from walkie-talkie:) heeey, buddy boy. so remember how we were talking about my technique? well, sometimes it leads to unexpected consequences.  dipper: yeah, you can say that again. where are you?  stan: the good news is, i've solved the mystery of where oregon's mummies come from. the bad news is...  (cuts to stan in a cave, trapped in spider silk and hanging from the ceiling right-side up. he has the walkie-talkie lodged in-between his shoulder and his head.)  stan: ...i'm about to become one. turns out darlene is one of those spider people. but beyond that, the date's been okay.  (cut back to the mystery mountain entrance.)  dipper: wait, wait, wait. darlene's a spider person?! how is that possible?  stan: (in cave:) i don't know. one minute we're having the perfect date, and the next minute she's growing extra legs and encasing me in webbing. women, right?  dipper: (at entrance:) you couldn't tell she was a spider?!  stan: (in cave:) i was blinded by flattery! also, this acid she spit in my face. i'm up the mountain at widow's peak.  dipper: (at entrance:) alright, i'm gonna find you. stay put!  stan: (in cave:) ...you got it.  darlene shoots a string of webbing at stan's walkie-talkie, bringing it to her. she walks toward stan, half-spider in appearance.  darlene: ah, aaaah! trying to escape? (throws walkie-talkie, breaking it)  stan: you tricked me! i'm 80% certain you don't really love me at all!  darlene: hah! men will fall for anything. (sing-song) you so funny, great story, i love a man with shoulder hair!  stan: you--you didn't mean it about my shoulder hair?!  darlene: (moves right next to stan) tell me, stan. before i transformed, who'd you think was in charge? you, with your cheesy lines and ""fake confidence?"" (walks away) i'm the master pickup artist here. sorry, toots! this time, you're getting used for your body! which, to my weird species, is food. allow me to slip into something more horrifying.  darlene uses her legs to pull her mouth open and over the rest of her skin, folding up her human appearance and revealing the true spider underneath.  stan: (screams)  darlene: i wonder what beverage pairs well with a vintage 70-something year old man? (walks away into the cave) be right baaaack! (laughs evilly)  stan: (frantically) come on, dipper, where are you?  cut to mabel, candy, and grenda sitting at the stump bench.  candy: i feel like such a fool. i should have known to guard my heart in a cage of ice.  grenda: there, there! let my calming voice soothe you!  candy: it is helping.  dipper: (runs on-screen, panting) girls! there you are.  mabel: betrayer!  candy: oh, you. what do you want?  dipper: i need your help.  candy: with what, some sick jealousy trap? (high-fives mabel)  mabel: yeah, sing it, candy!  grenda: testify!  dipper: look, i'm so sorry about everything. but stan's in trouble! you can totally kill me later, but right now he needs us. i'll explain on the way. (runs off-screen, with the girls following him)  (the kids walk up the trail, with old reliable going off in the background. they go past the trambience as well. cut to back in the cave.)  darlene: (off-screen:) doo, do-doo, doo...  stan: (praying) please. i don't know if you're really up there or not, but if you are, please save me, paul bunyan!  grenda: (off-screen:) mr. pines!  stan: whoa, did that really work? (turns to see the kids running into the cave)  grenda: (yells as she tears up the silk holding stan in place, making him fall to the ground)  stan: quick! before the rest of the venom sets in!  the kids tear the webbing off of stan. they all run out of the cave, with darlene at the entrance.  darlene: no! where are you? (runs after stan)  candy: the sky tram! everybody on! i have a plan!  the gang hops onto one of the trams on the trambience.  mabel: haha, yes!  grenda: perfect!  stan: ride like the wind, sky tram!  the tram is moving very slowly. a voice plays inside the tram.  recording: welcome to trambience, the world's slowest treetop tram ride. enjoy the sights at 0.1 miles per hour.  grenda: (groans) move, move, move! (begins stomping the floor with her feet)  dipper: ugh, can't this thing go any faster?  recording: no it can't. this is trambience.  darlene climbs up a pole holding the trams and looks for stan's tram. she jumps down on several trams as she searches for it.  recording: enjoying the view? (a loud bang is heard on top of the tram) take a picture!  darlene's head appears in the window, causing everyone to panic. she begins coating the tram in webbing.  stan: we're doomed!  dipper: we're all gonna die!  candy: (begins reading pamphlet) listen carefully! this sky tram has an emergency drop switch. below us is oregon's largest paul bunyan statue! and old reliable goes off in 5... (looks at watch) 4... (grabs emergency drop switch)  dipper: candy, wait! don't pull that lever! (candy keeps counting down)  stan: kid, are you crazy?!  candy: now! (pulls switch)  the tram is disconnected from the rail, sending it and darlene down to the ground. an old reliable goes off, pushing the tram into the air. it bounces and rolls across mystery mountain, barreling through the ticket booth below the paul bunyan statue. darlene is severed from the webbing and lies beneath the statue as its foot crashes down on her. she struggles to break free.  darlene: my only weakness! a giant boot! a giant newspaper or a giant cup would've also been pretty bad.  the door to the tram is pushed open. the gang stumbles out.  recording: thank you for riding trambience sky tram! tell your friends it was a boring, boring ride.  stan: (to candy:) kid, that was ingenious! how'd you know that would work?  candy: useless travel pamphlets.  darlene: (weak) staaaannnyyy... (she pulls her human head back on) i'm sorry. i dunno what came over me. you'll let me out, right?  stan: what?! after all that? seriously, do i look like an amnesiac?  darlene: (laughs) you're so funny. have you ever considered becoming a comedian?  stan: you know, i actually have. comedy is too subtle these days. my style involves more over-sized props. (walks to darlene) here, let me get you out from there--  the kids pull stan away from darlene as she turns back into a spider and reaches out to bite him.  stan: oh, yeah. right.  darlene: you win this round, stan! but mark my words, as long as there's men like you out there, with their dumb one-liners and pickup moves, i'll never run out of prey! (spits acid at stan's feet)  stan: aah! get the car, get the car!  the gang runs into the rv and drives away from mystery mountain. they get ready to go back to the mystery shack.  dipper: (sighs and wipes the girls' numbers off of his arm)  stan: (sighs) alright, kid. i gotta admit something. i'm no expert on women. truth is, i've been divorced once, and slapped more times than i can remember. confidence can buy you a lot, but at the end of the day, pickup artists tend to get our heads bitten off. when it comes to women, i'm a failure.  dipper: hey. (points to arm) we're both failures. you know, even if your dating tips were bad, i actually haven't thought about wendy all day. plus, you did teach me to be more confident. i guess i just need to learn to use that power for good. (walks over to candy, who is staring out the window) hey. i found a pamphlet i don't think you've read yet. (hands candy ""a loser's attempt at an apology"")  candy: (reads the pamphlet and smiles) it's okay, dipper. the open road makes people do crazy things. plus, after seeing you flee that spider like a baby, i kind of lost interest.  dipper: yep! yep. i deserve that.  the rv enters gravity falls. the kids cheer.  dipper: i still feel a little bad about wrecking those tourist traps.  stan: ah, come on. everyone loves my pranks! and the best part is, i never have to face any consequen--sweet lord!  stan stops the rv and gets out to see the owners of the tourist traps he pranked ruining the mystery shack.  stan: aw, come on!  a corn maze worker runs up and smashes one of the rv's headlights with a baseball bat.  corn maze worker: that's what you get! that's what you get! (runs away with the other tourist trap owners)  stan: i don't understand. i completely don't deserve this.  dipper: oh, man. are we gonna have to help clean this up?  mabel: nah, i'm sure soos will take care of it. where is soos, anyway?  credits: soos is still in the corn maze.  soos: okay, soos. remember what your grandma taught you. when you get lost, stay exactly where you are, and don't move. (pause) don't...move...! (pause) you know, i would make a really good scarecrow.  end."
36|gravity falls|Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future|October 12, 2015|"episode opens with dipper sleeping.  dipper pines: (wakes up and screams)  mabel pines: (as mr. upside-downington:) mornin', dipper, guess who!  dipper: oh, what joy. if it isn't mr. upside-downington. how long's it been? third grade, maybe?  mabel: that's right. and i'm here to deliver you an upside-downington-tastic message!  dipper: is it the message that we're getting too old for this sort of thing?  mabel: (normal voice:) um, kinda, actually. it's that we are exactly one week away from our 13th birthday!  dipper: whoa! our birthday's coming up already? (gasps) soon we're gonna be actual teenagers!  mabel: finally! i can stop reading preteen magazines and start reading post-preteen magazines.  dipper: pg-13 movies, here i come!  mabel: and just one more year until high school. high school, dipper! where girls become women and they teach us stuff about... (turns dipper around and whispers:) you know what.  dipper: trigonometry?  mabel: oh yeah, baby!  stan pines and soos ramirez enter the room.  stan: that's not the only good news coming up! in one week my senior citizen's ponytail kit is coming in the mail. i'm...i'm kinda going through some things.  soos: in one week, my grandma is finally letting me eat crackers on my bed! the future is coming for us all, dudes.  stan: the future.  dipper: the future!  mabel: the future!  dipper: (laughs) i'm sorry, i can't take you seriously with that face on your chin.  mabel: (as mr. upside-downington:) what face, dipper?  dipper: you're--you're doing the voice so you obviously know what i'm talking about--  mabel: bi bon't bnow bhat bou're balking about.  dipper and mabel: (laugh)  dipper: there is something wrong with you.  mabel: there's something wrong with both of us.  cut to theme song. cut to the living room of the mystery shack.  mabel: alright, party planners. in one week we become teenagers, and our summer vacation winds to an end. so we need to throw the greatest party of all time! i'm talking piñatas with tinier piñatas inside.  soos: boom, dreams comin' true! (pours little piñatas into a large piñata)  mabel: i'm talking inviting everyone in town. let's see, where do we stand with the gnomes?  stan: not so fast, goofus and girl-goofus. (walks into the room) after that zombie incident, no one's throwing another party at my house. i keep finding little bits of the undead in the couch cushions. (finds an arm under the chair cushion)  mabel: but grunkle stan, we need some roof to raise.  soos: dude, you could rent out the gravity falls high school gym, and have your party there. that place is empty all summer long.  mabel: the gym's a great idea, soos. to the high school!  the entire house quakes, startling everyone.  ford pines: (off screen) dipper, my face is on fire!  dipper: i'll just be a sec. (runs into ford's room) great uncle ford, are you okay?  ford: (wiping off his face, which is smoking, with a towel) oh yes, i'm fine. i just said that to make sure you'd come in here quickly.  dipper: but your face is on fire.  ford: yes, it's much faster than shaving. now, listen, dipper. i have a very important mission, and you are the only one who can help me. (pulls out the rift) remember the rift in dimensional space-time i showed you? it's cracking. (points at crack) this is what bill has been waiting for. if it breaks, it will cause reality as we know it to completely unravel. a hypothetical and catastrophic event i call weirdmageddon.  dipper stares at a blackboard ford has drawn up, detailing the finer points of weirdmageddon.  ford: bill is out there, and he'd use any trick, from deception to outright possession, to make this happen. but for the sake of humanity, we mustn't let it.  dipper: what do we do?  ford: we patch the rift. i'll explain on the way. (locks the rift in a protective case)  dipper: wait, what about mabel?  mabel: (standing in the doorway) it's okay, dipper. you should totally go with grunkle ford to save the world or whatever.  dipper: are you sure?  mabel: we're going to be doing birthday junk all week. plus, i packed us walky-talkies. here's one for my party mission, and one for your smarty mission. (laughs with dipper)  ford: (clears throat) i did mention that the fate of the universe is at stake, didn't i? hurry, we haven't much time. (leaves)  dipper: okay, dipper. it's your first big mission with ford. a chance to prove yourself. don't mess this up. (runs and hits the wall) ow! ah, heh heh, i'm alright. (laughs, then runs out and trips) ahh!  cut to gravity falls high school, where nate and lee are messing with its sign, which says ""sawdust inhalation drill- 8:00. go fighting beavers."" mabel and soos walk inside to see the gym filled with students.  mabel: whoa, soos, i thought you said this place was empty.  wendy corduroy: my dawgs, what up?  mabel: wendy, what are you doing here?  wendy: ugh, high school registration.  mabel: ooh! you know i'm only a year away from high school myself. would you say your experience is more rom-com, or wacky romp?  wendy: more like teen horror movie. high school is the worst. classes get super hard, your body just flat out turns against you, and worst of all, everybody hates you.  cut to two girls growling at each other, then pan to thompson and robbie.  thompson: can't do it! can't do another year!  robbie: my hormones are like a sweaty cage! (punches bulletin board)  mabel: why aren't they singing about following their dreams? tv taught me that high school was like some sort of musical.  wendy: tv lied, man! if you could avoid growing up, do it. i'd give anything to be 12 again. anyway, what are you guys doing here?  mabel: (chuckles, sadly:) oh, just looking for a place to have my 13th birthday party.  teacher: wendy...borduroy? i-i mean corduroy?  all the students laugh at wendy.  wendy: (blushes red) see what i mean? (walks to teacher)  mabel: (exits the gym; on the walkie talkie:) master mabel to dippidy dog. we can have our party at the gym, but we gotta talk about high school. starting to think it might not be the awesome future we were expecting. over.  dipper: (on the walkie talkie:) i'm going through a bad patch, mabel. we'll talk when i get back.  mabel: dipper? come in, come in?  soos: hey, i know what'll make you feel better. let's deliver some invites to your friends, huh?  mabel: yeah!  mabel and soos drive away. mabel finds that the sign now reads ""no escape."" cut to dipper and ford walking to the floating cliffs.  dipper: (to the walkie talkie:) mabel? mabel, you there? ugh.  ford: listen, dipper. in order to seal the rift for good, it's going to take an adhesive stronger than anything on earth. something...extraterrestrial in origin.  dipper: w-what do you mean?  ford: dipper, look at the peculiar shape made by those cliffs. does it remind you of anything?  dipper: hmm...  ford: (jingles his ufo key chain and holds it up over the cliffs)  dipper: (gasps quietly) shut. up.  ford: according to my research, the entire valley of gravity falls was formed when an extraterrestrial object crash-landed here millions of years ago. did this craft cause the town's strange properties? or, did the town's strange properties attract the craft? the answer is still unknown.  dipper: but, that's crazy! where did the saucer go?  ford: sometimes the strangest things in the world are right under our noses. (pushes rock away, revealing underground entrance) and our feet, in this particular instance. now you might wanna stand back. this magnet gun can rip the fillings out of a man's mouth from 100 feet.  dipper.: (backs away a few steps as ford detaches the opening) whoa! </td></tr>, <th>dipper. </th>, <tr> <th>ford: i used to raid this thing for parts for years. where do you think i got the materials to build my portal?  dipper: you...i...words... not working for mouth.  ford: now come. take this. (throws dipper a magnet gun)  dipper: (scrambling to catch the magnet gun) whoa, whoa!  ford: don't worry, i've been down here countless times; all the aliens have been dead for millions of years. (starts climbing down but then pops up) probably.  dipper takes a deep breath and heads down the entrance. cut to commercial.  dipper: i can't believe there's been a giant ufo under the town this whole time.  ford: i wish my mind could be where yours is right now, dipper. when confirmation of extraterrestrials still had that punch. now it's just sort of ""eh."" mcgucket and i used to come down here all the time to raid their tech and study their language.  dipper: this is so cool! (takes a selfie with some of the alien symbols and laughs)  ford: the substance we need to seal the rift is an alien adhesive. strong enough to keep the hull of a spacecraft together. just one dollop of this adhesive should be enough to seal a crack in space-time. also, if it touches you it will seal up all the orifices in your face, (cocks gun) so try to avoid that. now, use your magnet gun and follow me. hup! (uses magnet gun to climb down a pillar)  dipper: great uncle ford!  ford: your turn! say ""hup""! it helps!  dipper: (releases a deep breath) okay. just turn on magnet, leap down hole. turn on... (fiddles with gun) c'mon already. (gun whirs to life) magnet. (grunts as he jumps) ah! (crashes onto the ceiling) a little help?  cut to grenda's house. mabel knocks on her front door.  grenda: oh hi, mabel! you're just in time for our 1 o'clock boy talk.  mabel: if you think that's good...boom! me and dipper's 13th birthday jam!  grenda: aw, man. your birthday's on the last day of summer? i'm not gonna be here.  mabel: what?  grenda: marius is flying me out to austria to hang out in his castle or whatever that week. he's so clingy!  mabel: you're gonna be out of town for my birthday? but at least you can come, right, candy?  candy: sorry, mabel. my parents send me to music camp this time of year. there is no escape from music camp.  mabel: so neither of you are gonna be at my birthday party? and you won't be able to wish me goodbye at the end of the summer?  candy: i'm sorry, mabel.  grenda: summer happened so fast. (answers phone:) ugh, marius! now's not the time!  mabel: i think i need to radio for emotional back-up. (to walkie-talkie:) dipper, please come in. our party mission is going down in flames. over. (static on the walkie talkie; sighs)  cut to dipper and ford underground.  ford: this is their storage facility. this place would've been heavily guarded, but now everything's defunct. go ahead, flip any switch. they've all been busted for millions of years.  dipper pushes a button and it causes a petting zoo to fall down a hole.  sprott: (to a cow behind him:) clara, did you eat my farm?  clara: (moos)  cut back to dipper and ford.  ford: the glue should be around here somewhere, so keep your eyes peeled. dipper, let me ask you something. have you thought much about your future?  dipper: no, not really. i mean, beyond graduating high school with a high gpa so i can get accepted to a good technical college with a photography and media production minor to start my own ghost hunting show.  ford: ha, heh heh! it's like talking to a younger version of myself. if you're so sure of what you want out of life, why wait? why put up with the drudgery of school?  dipper: heh. trust me, i'd love to fast-forward the whole thing, but it's not like i have a choice.  ford: dipper, i've been thinking. i'm getting too old to investigate gravity falls on my own. i need to train an apprentice to help me fight monsters, solve mysteries, and protect this town. and i think i'd--i'd like to keep it in the family.  dipper: what are you saying?  ford: i've read your additions to my journal and i'm impressed with your potential. what would you say to staying in gravity falls after the summer ends and becoming my apprentice?  dipper: w-what about school?  ford: dipper, i have 12 phds. your parents would be thrilled i could give you such an advanced education.  dipper: (sighs) there's also mabel. she'd be all alone in california.  ford: mabel will be fine on her own. she has a magnetic personality. i watched her become pen pals with the pizza delivery man in the 60 seconds he was at the door.  dipper: gosh, we've never really been apart before.  ford: and isn't it suffocating? dipper, can you honestly tell me you never felt like you were meant for something more?  dipper: i-i dunno. sounds like a dream come true, but i'm not sure i have what it takes. i was tricked by bill, i was wrong about stan's portal. heck, i can't even operate this magnet gun right. (turns on the magnet gun and it sucks up a piece of metal. as dipper tries to get it free, something pink seeps out of it)  ford: ha! yes! dipper, you've found the adhesive!  dipper: i did?!  ford: hoho, you really did it, kid. huddle in, let's get a picture of this. (hears something and holds up gun)  dipper: (whispering:) uh, grunkle ford, you said everything in here is dead, right?  ford: yes. unless somehow we've reactivated the- (gasps) security system!  the security droids emerge.  dipper: what do we do?!  ford: listen to me very carefully: i've studied these; they're security droids and they detect adrenaline. you simply have to not feel any fear and they won't see you.  dipper: what?!  ford: it's okay. i've done it before. just take a deep breath, focus on your intellect, and control your fear.  dipper: huh-wha-wha-wha- that's crazy! i-  ford: follow my lead!  dipper: great uncle ford!  ford: focus, dipper!  the droid measures ford's heartbeat and finds it to be calm. it moves on to dipper.  dipper: wha- i-uh. i-i-uh...  the droid produces a gun.  dipper: i can't!  ford: get down! (tackles dipper, dodging the flash from the gun; stands up and shoots the droid, destroying it, but ford gets hit with a flash)  the other droid produces arms and drags ford toward it.  ford: uh! no! noooooo!  dipper: wait, no! (runs after him but trips)  ford: stay back! it's too dangerous! sealing the rift is what's important now! take this! (slides the rift to dipper)  the droid traps ford in itself.  ford: you're gonna have to do it without me! use the adhesive! fix the rift! save the universe, dipper!  the droid flies away into the tunnels.  dipper: great uncle ford! (chases the droid through the tunnels) hang on, i'm coming for you! (puts the rift in his backpack) don't worry! i'll get you out of there!  the droid disappears behind a saucer-shaped door.  dipper: where is that thing taking you?!  the room glows purple and some kind of map appears.  ford: (offscreen) it's an automated prison droid! and wherever it's going, i'm not coming back!  dipper: what?! (gasps as the ceiling opens to outside)  arm carries ford toward the opening.  dipper: no, no, no... don't worry, i'll think of something! (runs after ford)  ford: dipper! what on earth are you doing?!  dipper: (puts duct tape around the magnet gun) hold on, great uncle ford.  the droid ford is in hovers below the exit.  dipper: i'm getting you out of this, one way or another! (tries to fire the gun but it doesn't work) oh no! (punches the gun, which has sparks flickering around it)  the alien countdown appears to be at zero.  dipper: come on, come on! (the gun turns on and magnets dipper to ford's droid)  the droid blasts away.  dipper: aaaaaaaaahhhhh!!  the droid breaks through a grate and is outside, flying high into the air.  dipper: (hat falls off, grunting, pounds the droid) let go of my uncle! (screams as the droid shakes and beeps)  the droid, as dipper screams, swerves around, flies through the crack in the cliff, through the waterfall and through the water tower. the droid bumps, knocking ford unconscious.  dipper: ah! great uncle ford! okay, let's try: magnet pulse! (turns a knob on the gun) waaaaaaahhhh!  the droid crashes into the woods. dipper is lying behind it, bruised and moaning.  dipper: (gasps and runs to the droid) oh no! (pounding on the glass) oh no no no no! (opens the window and runs in to ford, who is still unconscious) come on, wake up, man! (drags him out) we gotta get out of here before-  another droid is behind them. it begins to scan dipper.  dipper: hey, uh, i'm warning you! i have a magnet gun!  the droid produces a large gun.  dipper: oh yeah!? you think you can scare me!? do your worst! nothing in this universe is gonna take away my uncle! so go ahead! give me what you've got!  the machine measures dipper's heartbeat, finds it normal, retracts its gun, and turns off.  dipper: (pants)  ford: ahahaha! oh- (coughs) oh, i thought i was a goner, kid. (coughs)  dipper: (runs to him) oh, are you alright? what happened?  ford: (leaning on dipper) the- the orb didn't detect any chemical signs of fear. it- it assumed the threat was neutralized and self-disassembled. hahaha!  dipper: i- i did it?  ford: you did it.  dipper: (walks over to the droid)  ford: this is what i was talking about. how many other twelve-year-olds do you think are capable of doing what you've just done. (nods)  cut to mabel in the attic looking at scrapbooks.  mabel: (sighs)  stan: (walks in) hey, everything all right, pumpkin?  mabel: just can't believe the summer's almost over. and now that i know how awful high school's going to be, i'm in no hurry to start that train wreck.  stan: (puts his arm around her shoulder) ah, nobody likes gettin' older. but just because you're growing doesn't mean you have to grow up, you know? i mean, look at me. i'm pushin' seventy and i still eat ice cream for dinner.  mabel: but i don't wanna say goodbye to gravity falls.  stan: hey, at least whatever happens after this summer, you'll still have your brother along with you through thick and thin. not everyone can say that, you know. (noogies her and leaves)  mabel: yeah, at least when i go home i always have dipper. (picks up a picture of dipper) good ol', reliable ol'-  her walkie-talkie crackles.  dipper: (faint, over walkie-talkie:) are you okay?  ford: (faint, over walkie-talkie:) i'm fine.  dipper: let's get you out of there.  cut to dipper and ford.  ford: listen to me, dipper: this town is a magnet for things that are special. and that includes you and me. it brought both of us here for a purpose! stay here with me, dipper. become my apprentice. don't let anyone hold you- (coughs)  dipper: (offers him his hand) i'll do it; i'm gonna stay.  ford: excellent. (grabs dipper's hand and climbs out of the ditch) now who wants to save the world, apprentice?  dipper and ford: (walk away laughing)  dipper's walkie-talkie makes static noises.  cut to the attic.  dipper: (comes in) mabel! i just had the best day of my life! ufos are real and there's one under the town and i saved great uncle ford's life and- and... (sees that mabel is lying on her bed with her back to him, unmoving) hey, are you okay?  mabel: tell me it's not true, dipper. tell me you were joking. (holds up the walkie-talkie, which emits static) ford's apprentice? seriously?  dipper: look, i was thinking and... this is a huge opportunity for me.  mabel: (crying) well it's a horrible opportunity for me! i had the worst day of my life! when we turn thirteen, the summer ends, and i have to leave everything behind. you're the only person i can count on and now you're leaving me too!?  dipper: look, i've been thinking about it. i won't be gone forever, okay? i'll still visit you at home, and we'll chat online; we'll make it work.  mabel: i don't want it to work. i just wish summer could last forever.  dipper: (walks over to her and puts his arm on her) but it can't, mabel. look, things aren't gonna stay frozen this way. it's part of growing up. things change. summer ends.  mabel: (yells and runs away)  dipper: ah! (falls over, as he was leaning on her) mabel, wait! i didn't mean it like that! mabel, come back!  mabel: (runs into the woods crying; sits under a tree, digs through the backpack) only party chocolate can cheer me up now. (holds up a notebook) nerd books? (holds up pens) chewed up pens? ugh, wrong backpack. not fair. i just wish summer could last forever. (pulls her sweater over herself)  bill cipher: (possessing blendin blandin; offscreen) that might be possible!  mabel: sweatertown is not accepting incoming calls right now.  bill: m-m-m-mabel, it's me.  mabel: what? who said that?  bill: (walks up to her, adjusting camoflauge suit) i-i-i can help.  mabel: the time travel guy? what are you doing here?  bill: you said you don't want summer to end, right? d-did-did i hear that right?  mabel: yeah... why are you asking?  bill: look, maybe it's against the rules, but you once did a favor for me, so i thought i could help you out. it's called a time bubble, and it prevents time from going forward. summer in gravity falls can last as long as you want it to!  mabel: (wipes up tears) r-really? but how does it work?  bill: i just need you to get a little gizmo for me from your uncle. (wristwatch displays the rift) it's something small. he won't even know it's missing.  mabel: huh. maybe dipper has something like that in his nerd-bag.  cut to ford in the lab. dipper walks in.  ford: let me guess: mabel didn't take it well?  dipper: i don't know, maybe i'm making the wrong decision. i need to think about this.  ford: dipper, right now we need to focus on the mission. now come on, i've got the glue; hand me the rift and let's make history.  dipper: (reaches into bag and pulls out birthday flyer) what? oh no! the rift!  cut to mabel in the woods.  mabel: (pulls the rift out of the backpack) huh. that's... odd. this it?  bill: yes, that's it! just hand it over and i'll do my thing. unless you're ready to leave gravity falls.  mabel: just a little more summer. (gives it to him)  bill: oops. (drops it and stomps on it, breaking it)  mabel: what?!  bill: (laughs maniacally, takes off goggles to reveal his eyes)  mabel: oh no! wait, wait wait!  bill: (snaps fingers, making mabel fall unconscious; leaves blendin's body) at last! at long, long last! the gateway between worlds has opened! the event one billion years prophesized has finally come to pass! the day has come! the world is finally mine! (laughs maniacally as the rift tears reality into the nightmare realm)  townspeople look on, worried. wind blows. dipper and ford run out of the mystery shack.  dipper: what's going on?! what is that?!  ford: we're too late! it's the end of the world.  bill: (rises up, cackling maniacally)  zoom into bill's eye; end credits: dipper and mabel's birthday flyer sits on the ground as lightning crackles and screams are heard. a helicopter is heard above and the flyer blows away."
37|gravity falls|Weirdmageddon Part 1|October 26, 2015 |"episode opens with bill laughing below the tear in the sky.  bill cipher: oh, it's happening. it's finally finally happening! (continues laughing as what appears to be muscle fiber covers him) physical form? don't mind if i do! (is encased in a metal pyramid and vanishes)   blendin blandin: huh?! what just happened? (as mabel pines is lifted up and locked into a bubble with her shooting star symbol on it) oh. oh man. this is bad! this is real bad! guys, we've got a situation! (presses a button on his watch, causing him to vanish)  cut to downtown.  deputy durland and sheriff blubs: what the—?  tyler cutebiker: (gasps)  lazy susan: wha?  bill: (laughs, deep voice:) alright, listen up you one lifespan, three dimensional, five sense skin puppets! (normal voice:) for one trillion years i've been trapped in my own decaying dimension, waiting for a new universe to call my own. name's bill! but you can call me your new lord and master for all of eternity! (melts the statue of nathaniel northwest)  blubs, durland, and tyler: ah!  bill: now meet the gang of interdimensional criminals and nightmares i call my friends. (as they come out of the scar in the sky) 8 ball! kryptos! the being whose name must never be said! haha, what the heck. it's zanthar. then of course there's also teeth, keyhole, hectorgon, amorphous shape, pyronica, paci-fire, and these guys. this is our town now, boys!  bill and his friends laugh.  tyler: now see here, you unholy triangle fella. as mayor, i strongly urge you to git...git on out of here.  lazy susan: yeah! things with one eye are weird!  grenda: we don't like out-of-towners.  manly dan: we punch what we don't understand!! (rips open mailbox)  preston northwest: i would just like to say that as a rich capitalist i welcome your tyrannical rule. perhaps i could be one of your, uh... horsemen of the apocalypse?  pacifica northwest: dad!  preston: not now, sweetie, the grownups are talking.  bill: oh wow, that's a great offer. how 'bout instead i shuffle the functions of every hole in your face? (snaps fingers; preston's face becomes mixed up)  preston: (falls over, screaming as his family watches in horror)  bill: (laughs as the people run away, turns durland to stone)  sheriff blubs: (picks up durland) durland! my precious deputy durland. no!  eye-bat: (takes durland away)  bill: it's time we do a little redecorating. i could really use a castle of some kind. (a pyramid forms in the sky) and how about some bubbles of pure madness! (colorful bubbles appear)  a bubble passes through sprott, who rips off his shirt and screams madly.  bill: this party never stops. time is dead and meaning has no meaning. existence is upside-down and i reign supreme. welcome, one and all, to weirdmageddon!  the water tower roars. cut to remixed theme song. cut to dipper and ford pines in front of the mystery shack.  ford: so this is how the world ends. not with a bang but with a... boop-boop.  dipper: weirdmageddon.  birds caw and fly over ford and dipper. various animals follow them.  dipper: (gets knocked over by a deer) agh!  gnome: move it, stretch.  gnome 2: hey, we're scampering here!  ford: (lifts dipper back up) the rift is shattered. bill's world is spilling into ours and every minute his powers grow stronger.  dipper: mabel! the rift must have cracked inside her backpack. she must be in danger. i have to go find her. (running, to the walkie talkie:) mabel! come in, mabel! mabel!  ford: (stops him) dipper. listen to me. we can find your sister soon, but first we have to stop bill. if we can blast him back through the rift he came out of, we just might be able to stop him before his weirdness spreads across the entire globe.  dipper: are you sure defeating bill is even possible?  ford: no. i'm not sure. but being a hero means fighting back even when it seems impossible. will you follow me?  dipper: to the ends of the earth.  ford: good. because that's where we're heading. you also might want to step inside.  dipper and ford: (run inside)  gnome: weirdness wave!  the wave washes over the mystery shack and over soos' house, causing the barbecue to come to life and run away.  soos: (from window) ah! abuelita! a tidal wave of madness just went over us!  abuelita: (offscreen) oh, soos, such an imagination.  soos: (turns around and sees that abuelita is a chair) ah! you've turned into a chair!  abuelita: why don't you have a seat and relax?  soos: but what about you? and my friends?  abuelita: i'll be fine. you go help the others.  soos: when the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it. (kisses abuelita and runs off) i'm coming for you, friends!  abuelita: time for a nap. (reclines)  cut to stan nailing a sign to a tree.  gompers: (grabs the tassel on stan pines' fez)  stan: hey!  gompers: (tears off the tassel and eats it)  stan: that's it, goat! it's time i threw you off this property for good!  the wave comes over them and gompers grows until he is as tall as the trees.  stan: on second thought, i'm gonna run like a coward now. (screams and runs away)  gompers: (walks off)  cut to the arcade. the wave washes over it and several video game characters break out the windows.  rumble mcskirmish: ha! freedom! freedom to punch! (punches the air)  cut to gravity falls maximum security prison.  prison counselor: okay, inmates, time to review your finger paintings. (looking at paintings) good. nice. (gasps when he sees gideon's painting, which is a torn paper with a knife in it and ""revenge"" written on it and ""love"" written next to a picture of mabel; the man sighs) gideon, does this look like someone who's ready to re-enter society?  ghost-eyes: gideon's unappreciated in his time!  gideon: oh, ghost-eyes, you're making me blush!  killbone: gideon makes prison life worth living.  prisoners except gideon: gideon! gideon!  gompers: (eats a bit of the ceiling, making the rest crumble down and crushes counselor)  prisoners: (look outside and gasp at scene of abnormal creatures)  gideon: (looks at the three-headed bird which has landed on his hand. it screeches) oh my. bill came through.  cut to bill and his friends downtown.  bill: ready to cause some havoc, boys?  bill's friends: (laugh)  behind bill, dipper looks out the clock tower and ford readies his rifle.  ford: ah, my quantum destabilizer. i've been waiting a long time to use this. we're only gonna have one chance to take this shot. (aims it at bill) steady... steady... and...  the wave washes over them, making the bell come to life.  bell: woohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoo!! i'm alive now!  ford: (fires, but only hits bill's hat) oh no!!  bill: (hat heals) well, well, well, and here i thought today couldn't get any better. (fires a beam at the tower, destroying it)  dipper: (lying in the wreckage, bruised) great uncle ford!  ford: (trapped under some wreckage, grunts) dipper! take my journals! (slides the backpack to dipper, who picks up journal 3) listen, i know of one other way to defeat bill, it's- (hears something behind him) oh, no! dipper! run! get down!  dipper: (runs down the stair)  bill: (rises behind ford with the six-fingered hand symbol in his eye) good old six-fingers. i've been waiting an (deep voice:) eternity (normal voice:) to have a chat face to face. (lifts ford up)  ford: wah!  bill: everyone, this armageddon wouldn't be possible without help from our friend here. give him a six-fingered hand!  bill's friends: (offscreen, clap and cheer)  dipper: (comes around the corner of the clock tower)  bill: this brainiac is the one who built the portal in the first place! now don't look so sour, fordsy. it's not too late to join me. with that extra finger, you'd fit right in with my freaks.  ford: i'll die before i join you! i know your weakness, bill!  bill: oh, yeah? (eye becomes a question mark) and i know a riddle. why did the old man do this? (assumes a pose)  ford: this? (imitates bill's pose)  bill: (shoots a laser at ford, petrifying him)  dipper: (gasps)  bill: (picks up ford) because i needed a new backscratcher! (laughs with his friends as he scratches himself with ford)  dipper: (growls) that's enough! (comes out from behind building) hand over my uncle! or else! (holds up journal 3)  bill: now isn't. this. (flies up to dipper and his eye glows white; with a deep voice along with his normal voice:) interesting? (normal voice:) my old puppet is back for an encore. you think you can stop me? (punches the air) go ahead, pine tree, show me what you've got.  dipper: (flipping through 3 and shining blacklight on it) i...uh... i... uh... (sees that the journal says ""if he gains physical form then all is lost!"")  bill: i um i. do it, kid. do some brilliant thing that takes me down right now. whattdya got, pine tree, everyone's waiting. do it.  dipper: (jumps at bill) augh, bill! (his fist hits a force field in front of bill's eye and he is thrown backward into a tree; he rubs his head) ugh...  bill's friends: (laugh)  dipper: (reaches for journal 3)  bill: (levitates the journals) that's right. don't be a hero, kid. (waves ford) this is what happens to heroes in my world. (burns the journals)  dipper: no!! the journals!!  bill: not much of a threat now, are you? (to his friends:) now can anyone remind me why we came here?  8 ball: to get weird!  bill: that's right! vip party at the fearamid. oh, and 8 ball, teeth, you've earned a treat, have the kid for a snack.  dipper: huh?  8 ball: (rolls eyes)  teeth: heheheheh.  bill: hench-maniacs, roll out! (turns a car into a racecar-like vehicle)  demons: (get into the car)  pyronica: let's get out of here, bill!  bill: (drives away, firing lasers, changing things as he goes, laughing maniacally)  dipper: (stares at 8 ball and teeth, panting)  8 ball: so, you wanna eat him, or, something?  teeth: oh, definitely, let's eat him.  dipper: ahhhhh!!! (runs away as they follow him)  shandra jimenez: (on tv, which is lying among the wreckage) we are day three in this strange cataclysmic event, which some are calling ""weirdmageddon,"" or the ""oddpocalypse."" weather today calls for black clouds, blood rain and frequent showers of eyeball bats turning people into stone. i'm shandra jimenez, and i ate a rat for dinner.  eye-bat: (turns pizza guy into stone and carries him away)  dipper: (gets out from under some garbage bag and sees an eyeball bat following him) huh! (runs into an alley; into walkie talkie:) mabel, it's me. so far i have eluded capture but i haven't been able to find you or stan anywhere. i don't know if you can hear me, but wherever you are, whatever happens, i'm going to find you.  pterodactyl: (screeches and takes the ""a"" out of ""malls"" on the gravity malls' sign)  dipper: the mall! maybe they're hiding in there! (runs to the mall and runs into the glass) oh no!  the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity: hey. hey you. hey, i wanna talk to you. i wanna talk to you about going inside my mouth. i- i think you wanna get in here. (crawling toward dipper) hey, you, hey! i'm talkin' to you, man! you don't have to make a big deal outta this! hello! hello!  dipper: (as he talks, forces himself through the mall's automatic doors, but gets stuck in them)  the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity: (slaps the door, freeing dipper) why are you just ignoring me? (reaches inside) that's seriously rude to just ignore someone like this.  dipper: (backs into the food court) stan! mabel! (sees nachos on a table) huh, maybe at least i can get something to eat. the last nachos on earth. (picks them up and is trapped in a net) ah! help! the nachos tricked me!  wendy corduroy: (pokes her head out from a plant) dipper?  dipper: wendy!? oh no! you've been transformed into some sort of... tree monster!  wendy: ha! it's just camouflage. my dad made me and my brothers do apocalypse training every year instead of christmas. guess it's sort of cool the paranoia paid off. (shoots a bat) nice! bat meat. let me get that for ya. (throws ax at the net, freeing dipper)  dipper: ah! wendy, i'm so glad to find you! (hugs her) i thought everyone i knew was gone.  wendy: hey, hey, it's okay. we have each other now. and toby determined, who i accidentally mistook for a monster.  toby: this just in: this arrow in my shoulder.  wendy: we shouldn't stay out in the open for too long. let me show you my hideout. (leads them to the edgy on purpose store, cooks the bat) we were playing truth or dare in the cemetary when it happened. the eyeballs froze nate, lee, tambry and thompson. (presses a button on the cash register she's sitting on and takes some money to wipe her face with) robbie almost got away but had to pause to take a selfie. what about you?  dipper: i was in a fight with mabel when it happened. uncle ford asked me to be his apprentice once the summer was over. but that would mean i wouldn't go back home. it would mean growing up without mabel.  wendy: oh, dude.  dipper: mabel didn't take it well and she ran off into the forest. she couldn't even look me in the eye.  wendy: come on. let's get some fresh air. toby, you watch the camp.  toby: (dressed in a bunch of the edgy on purpose clothes) don't call me ""toby"" anymore. call me bodacious t.  wendy: no one will ever call you that.  toby: ooh...  cut to dipper and wendy outside.  wendy: the end of the world. man, those death metal album covers got it shockingly right.  dipper: you know, i used to think i could get out of anything, but this? the journals are destroyed, ford is captured and i can't find my family anywhere. bill said it himself, there's no room for heroes out here. we lost.  wendy: look, dude, it's not over yet. you've beaten bill twice before, why is this time any different?  dipper: 'cause then i had mabel.  wendy: then you need to get mabel back. look, this summer, i've seen some amazing things, but nothing as amazing as you and your sister. i don't know if it's dumb luck or yin and yang, or whatever, but when you two work together, there's like nothing you two can't accomplish. you just need to make up, and team up, and save the universe.  dipper: but how will i ever find her?  a monster eats a billboard, revealing a bubble with mabel's shooting star on it at the cliffs.  dipper: the shooting star from mabel's sweater! she's in there. i know it.  wendy: whoa, it that like twin esp?  dipper: no, we don't have that, but we do have this thing where our allergies totally act up at the same time. (sneezes) mabel needs us. but how are we gonna get out there without being caught?  wendy: i have an idea.  cut to the fearamid, where the party is going on.  demons: (spinning a stone lazy susan) spin the person! spin the person! (lazy susan's head points at pyronica)  hectorgon: ah! (flies away)  pyronica: (catches him with her tongue and swallows him)  bill: hahahaha! go nuts, guys! when we're done partying, i unveil phase 2.  lolph: (offscreen, pounding on door) open up! this is the police. time police.  the demons all look at bill.  bill: just play it cool, ditch the time-punch. let me do the talking.  lolph: bill cipher. you are in violation of the rules of space-time, and possessing the body of a time officer.  blendin: my body is a temple! how dare you!!  time baby: hear this, cipher!  bill: ugh, time baby.  time baby: (projects a hologram of the universe) if your rip in this dimension continues, it could destroy the very fabric of existence! (the universe in the hologram explodes) surrender now, or face my tantrum!  bill: oh, no, a tantrum! whatever will a do about that how 'bout this?? boom. (vaporizes the time baby and the police; eye turns into a mouth and blows the smoke off his finger)  kryptos: ah, snap! he just killed time baby!  demons: yeahhh! (resume partying)  blendin: (hiding behind a pole) aw, man, this has gone from bad to worse! i gotta get out of time-dodge! (disappears)  8 ball: (approaches with teeth) boss, the pine tree kid got away before we could eat him. are you worried he might try to cause some trouble?  teeth: yeah, trouble with mabel's bubble?  bill: ha! i'm not worried. i've got someone on the case.  cut to the bud gleeful's auto-mart. dipper, toby and wendy are looking over the fence.  wendy: the abandoned auto-mart. free cars right for the hot-wiring. we just found our ride to mabel. i wonder if they have a tank. i've always wanted to drive a tank!  dipper: i can't believe this place is just abandoned.  toby: (looking into a car) ooh, an air freshener. finally i'll smell like a person. stealy stealy...  a tranquilizer dart hits him.  toby: ah! it's gonna take more than one dart to keep me from-  several more darts hit him and he collapses.  wendy: oh no! tony! was it tony? i can never remember his name.  three car headlights turn on in front of them. three giant cars, each with prisoners inside, surround them.  prisoner: well, well, looks like we got ourselves a pair of ground walkers.  prisoner 2: heheh! ground walkers! heheh! ain't got no wheels!  prisoners: (laugh)  wendy: listen discount auto warriors!  dipper: we just wanna make it to that bubble out east; we have no quarrel with you!  gideon: (with a voice-lowering megaphone:) oh, but that's where you're wrong! hands where i can see 'em.  dipper and wendy: (hold up hands)  gideon: y'all fellers ain't goin' nowhere.  wendy: ""y'all?""  dipper: ""fellers?"" wait... gideon!?  gideon: that's sheriff gideon! (without megaphone:) under the authority of bill cipher, i place you two under arrest! oh, hi, wendy! have we formally met?  prisoners lead dipper and wendy to gideon, who is standing on the back of a truck.  gideon: wooooo-we! look what the apocalypse dragged in! y'all are in a twelve-piece bucket of deep fried trouble now! ghost-eyes! spitoon!(spits gum out into spitoon)  dipper: ugh, it's gideon.  wendy: and he's gotten folksier.  gideon: ma' old pal bill figured you might try to rescue mabel. so he appointed me, master of these wastelands, and keeper of the bubble! my sweet precious mabel's trapped inside and i have the only key! (shows them a key with the shooting star symbol on it) wrapped around my... well i wouldn't call it a neck exactly, wrapped around this little pocket of fat under ma' head?  dipper: gideon, you have no right to keep her in there!  gideon: bill explained it to me nice and simple: she was always destined to be mine! (takes a newspaper article from when he was dating her from his hat) and now that i have her in a cage she'll learn to love me! i have an eternity to wait! ghost-eyes! ready to escort our friends to bill's dungeon?  ghost-eyes: (picks dipper and wendy up)  dipper: uh! no! hey!  wendy: this isn't gonna work, gideon.  gideon: oh? and why's that?  wendy: cause after i break ghost-eyes' arm and steal that key from your neck, i'm gonna wear your butt on my foot like a rhinestone slipper!  prisoners behind gideon: (laugh)  gideon: oho, and what makes you think you can do all that?  wendy: 'cause i'm a flippin' corduroy! (flips over ghost-eyes' arm and pulls him back)  dipper: (falls on the ground and ducks, tripping ghost-eyes)  dipper and wendy: (run away)  gideon: ghost-eyes! my hench-angel!  wendy: ha! (grabs gideon and rips the key from his neck, to prisoners:) get back! get back! or i will drop-kick him, i swear! (breaks a car window and unlocks it)  gideon: you'll never get away with this, ya hear me?!  wendy: guess what? we already did! (kicks gideon into the other prisoners)  dipper: (getting into the car behind her) wendy, you're the coolest person i know.  wendy: i know, dude. tell me about it later. (drives away)  gideon: after them!  prisoners: (get into cars)  ghost-eyes: (carrying gideon into a car) you want your baby seat?  gideon: yes, please.  ghost-eyes: (buckles him into a carseat)  gideon: (over a microphone:) we are not letting 'em get mabel! discount auto-mart warriors, rollout!  prisoners: (drive away, cheering)  dipper: okay, all we have to do is outrace gideon's henchmen, unlock the bubble, save mabel, save the world. (sees that wendy had hit a mailbox) quick question: did you ever get your driver's license?  wendy: definitely not. arm! (swerves to avoid the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity)  dipper and wendy: ah!  the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity: (grabs one of the cars)  prisoner inside car: uhahhhhh! (screams this as windshield cracks)  the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity: (eats the car)  gideon: swerve swerve! (ghost-eyes swerves to avoid the arm) i can't let 'em free mabel!  ghost-eyes: remind me why you're keeping your girlfriend in a prison bubble again? have we, the prisoners, become the wardens?  gideon: she loves me! she just doesn't know it yet. now quit the philosophy.  ghost-eyes: sorry. it was my major.  the cars drive toward some bubbles.  gideon: ha! weirdness bubbles blockin' the path! woooowee we got 'em now.  dipper: watch it! go around that bubble field!  wendy: no way around! hold on! we're goin' through!  dipper: what's even in there?!  dipper and wendy: (scream as they enter a bubble, then they have bird heads)  dipper: (chirping, subtitled:) for some reason, i really want worms right now.  wendy: (chirping, subtitled:) eat worms! fly south! nest!  the car exits the bubble and dipper and wendy are normal again.  dipper: (coughing up feathers) oh, that was horrible!  wendy: here comes another one, dude! brace yourself! (drives through three more bubbles)  dipper and wendy: (screaming, they become anime characters, then they are made of meat products, then they become live-action)  gideon and ghost-eyes: (screaming, they become made of 3d blocks, female versions of themselves in dresses and make-up, and old-fashioned silent cartoon versions of themselves, a card comes up that says:) ""aaaaaaaaaugh!""  both the cars are back to normal. ghost-eyes slams his truck against wendy's car, breaking the glass.  wendy: ah!  dipper: wendy, we're almost there! we just have to make that jump!  wendy: total lack of driver's training, don't fail me now. (accelerates and drives off the cliff, screaming as the car flies through the air)  the car hits the ground and rolls. when it stops, the passenger door opens and dipper falls out.  dipper: so... close. (crawling) mabel... i'm... almost there. (stops in front of a figure in a cloak)  soos: (offers him his hand and pulls back his hood) heya, dipper. how's it hanging?  dipper: soos!  wendy: (stands up from behind the car, bruised) soos?  soos: handyman of the apocalypse, at your service.  dipper: soos! how'd you, where'd you-?  soos: i've been wandering the plains like a desperado, helping strangers. i guess there's some folk songs about me now? (looking at wendy's arm) let me see what the damage is, here. ah, well the good news is: your arm is okay.  dipper: so what's the bad news?  soos: bad news is we're surrounded, dudes.  the prisoners have surrounded them, cheering.  gideon: wooowee. i dare say y'all almost had the jump on me there for a second. but this ain't your gravity falls anymore! out here, i win. (claps and gets thrown a conch, which he blows) bill's henchbats will be here any minute to retrieve y'all. mabel's mine now! hahahaha!  dipper: is she?  gideon: well, yeah. i have her trapped, ergo, mabel is mine!  dipper: gideon, listen to me, if i've learned anything this summer it's that you can't force someone to love you. (looking at wendy) the best you can do is strive to be someone worthy of loving.  gideon: oh, i'm worthy o' lovin'! these prisoners love me!  prisoners except gideon: (cheer)  dipper: but mabel doesn't. because you're selfish. but you can change! bill thinks there's no heroes in this world, but if we work together and fight back, we can defeat him. you wanna be mabel's hero? stand up to bill, and let us save her!  gideon: that's crazy! you know what bill would do to me if that happens?  ghost-eyes: what, you scared of bill?  gideon: no, i ju... it's a complicated situation.  dipper: look inside, gideon. if all this is for mabel, then ask yourself what mabel would want you to do.  gideon: (looks at the newspaper article, looks at the picture of him and mabel together, with him smiling and mabel looking unconformable, quietly:) dipper. will you tell her what i did?  dipper: of course.  gideon: i hope you're right about this. (to the prisoners:) guys, new plan! bill's minions are gonna be on us in seconds. but i'm not gonna let that dumb triangle be the warden o' me! y'all ready for a good old fashioned prison brawl?  ghost-eyes: we're behind you for life, brother!  prisoner: fighting children is boring, but fighting a chaos god sounds fun!  gideon: lets do this! (as the prisoners drive toward the fearamid) henchmen, rollout!  prisoners: (cheer)  soos: whew! and i thought i was gonna have to throw down!  cut to dipper, soos and wendy in front of mabel's bubble.  dipper: okay, remember, guys. this is a prison bubble designed by bill. we've got to prepare ourselves for what we find in here.  soos: whatever it is, we'll do it together. for mabel! (puts his hand in the center)  wendy: (puts her hand on top of his) for mabel!  dipper: (puts his hand on top of theirs) for mabel.

(manly dan holds up a triangular section of a stop sign that he cut) that's it. that's probably what bill wants.  an eye-bat comes and manly dan screams as he is turned to stone.  sprott: i reckon i've been livin' a lie. (screams as he is turned to stone and then carried away by the eye-bat)  cut to the fearamid. bill cipher taps a fork on ford pines (who is still turned to gold) and the music stops.  bill: ladies, gentlemen, that creature with like 87 different faces.  creature with 88 different faces: 88 different faces!  bill: whoa-ho, sorry - touchy subject. anyways, it's been fun turning gravity falls inside out, rounding up all its terrified citizens and then stacking them into this massive throne of frozen human agony.

(collects some glitter in his hand and drops it) bill's using mabel's own fantasies as some sick trap. we need to grab mabel and get the heck out of here.  craz: oh, mabel? she's at the top of the tallest tower guarded by those big buff waffle guards. there's no way to get past them!  soos: someone hand me some syrup.

(eye flashes journal pages)  keyhole: bill! (bill's eye back to normal) uh, sorry, boss, but gideon let the pines family escape! they're inside mabel's bubble as we speak!  bill: (laughs) buddy, mabel's bubble is the most diabolical trap i've ever created. it would take a will of titanium not to give into its temptation. fetch me gideon and take the rest of the day off. things just got a little more interesting.  cut to mabeland. dipper is standing in front of a river.  stuffed animal tree: (singing:) bum ba bum bo, i'm a stuffed animal tree...  stuffed animals: (singing:) he's a stuffed animal tee-hee-hee!  dipper: (angrily throws a stone across the river; it skips while a child's giggling is heard) ugh, even my stone skips are perfect!

(run to him)  stan: kids! i can't believe it! i thought i lost you two!  soos: (hugs stan) mr. pines! it's really you! i've been hugging strangers to practice for this moment.  wendy: (slams into stan for a hug) we missed you, you old codger!  stan: (chuckles) i've missed you knuckleheads, too. it's good to have you back.  dipper: so...what's everyone doing here? (gasps as some lilliputtians run past him)  mabel: yeah there's like monsters and gnomes, and is pacifica wearing a potato sack?  pacifica: hey! even in a sack i still look better than you.  multi-bear: it's...it's a long story.  wax larry king: (in the vents) hey, is anyone gonna feed me? larry king's disembodied wax head wants num-nums.  grenda: we're trying to ration our food, remember? (as wax larry king chews on her hair) uhhh...it's happening again.  multi-bear: (closes the vents)  pituitaur: (looking out the door) hey, everyone! eye-bat!  everyone gasps.  gnome: evasive maneuvers!  stan: (slams the door and grabs dipper and mabel) shhh, keep it down.  the refugees scatter.  gnome: hit the lights!  outside, an eye-bat turns a scampering raccoon into stone and flies off with it. cut to theme song.  stan: (lights a match and throws it into a can, illuminating the shack, revealing the people sitting around the room) welcome to what's left of normal around here. home base.  the screen pans across the various people hiding in the mystery shack.  toby determined: (as a gnome pulls a dart out of him) ow!  greggy c.: we have... </td></tr>, <th>greggy c. </th>, <tr> <th>sev'ral timez: (singing:) several injuries! (clutch their injuries) oh, ow...  chubby z.: ow, my liver, girl! </td></tr>, <th>chubby z. </th>, <tr> <th>dipper: ah! rumble mcskirmish?  rumble: do not be afraid. weirdmageddon has taught me, there are some battles i cannot win. i am now humble mcskirmish. (a digital ""-50 despair"" pops up next to rumble)  mabel: grunkle stan, how'd this all happen?  stan: so i was hammering signs out back when the sky started vomiting nightmares. i listen to a lot of am radio so i knew what this meant: the end of the world. (flashback of stan running inside as the weirdness wave descends) what i didn't expect was what happened next. (the totem pole comes to life and attempts to attack the house, but hits a dome around it) turns out whatever you and my brother did to the shack with your unicorn voodoo made the crazy place invincible to weirdness. (the totem pole falls over; cut back to the present.)  dipper: of course, the unicorn spell. that's why this is the only place bill's magic can't touch.  stan: (gesturing to old man mcgucket) that's when possum breath over here shows up leading a bunch of injured stragglers through the forest. they needed a place to stay and since the mayor got captured, i elected myself de facto chief. the plan's to stay in here and eat brown meat until we run out, then i vote we eat the gnomes.  jeff: hey! i'm short, not deaf!  stan: shh! shh! stress will make you chewy.  dipper: grunkle stan, we can't all just hide inside the shack. there's a town in need of saving. me and ford tried to do it, but he got captured by bill.  stan: (opens can of the brown meat) serves that jerk right. my brother's had some stupid plans, but going up against an all-powerful space demon was his worst one yet. trust me, we have everything we need right here. (sits down on a wooden lounge chair surrounded by the multi-bear and gnomes) it's not the ritz but at least the monsters inside know how to massage. (to the multi-bear:) you know shiatzu?  multi-bear: yes, i've taken some classes.  dipper: so you're really just gonna let bill win?  stan: look, kiddo. we got a good deal here. besides, i'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine. (slams his hand down, accidentally hitting the remote and turning on the tv)  shandra jimenez: (on the tv:) this is shandra jimenez reporting live from the inside of bill's castle. here for the first time are images of what's happened to the captured townsfolk. viewers are advised to look away if they don't want to see their friends turned into a twisted throne of human agony.  pacifica: mom and dad?  wendy: my family!  sheriff blubs: deputy durland!  shandra: is there no one who will save the people of this town? i'm shandra jimenez and i'm being turned into stone by a flying eyeball. (the tv turns to static)  everyone gasps.  pacifica: oh, no. my parents are bad but even they don't deserve to be turned to stone.  sheriff blubs: (drops down on his knees) curse you, bill! why must you take everything we love? (rips his shirt open and cries)  mabel: (climbing on top of the multi-bear) guys, don't you see? our friends need us, but we can only save them if we fight back. (pulls dipper up after her)  dipper: mabel is right. bill wants us to run and hide. he wants us to think he's invincible. but ford told me before he was captured that he knows bill's secret weakness.  the refugees perk up and start muttering.  wendy: weakness?  dipper: now, if we band together, if we combine all of our strength, our smarts, our...whatever toby has...  toby: various rashes!  dipper: ...then we just might be able to rescue ford, learn bill's weakness, and save gravity falls!  everyone cheers.  stan: whoa! whoa! whoa! have you all forgotten who's in charge here? besides, we're only safe inside! it's not like we can take the mystery shack to bill.  mcgucket: wha--whoa! holy hootenany! flapjack and fiddlebanjos! sorry, sorry. got a little excited. (thumps his foot and slaps his knee) what i meant to say is i think i figured out a way to fight bill and rescue ford. but we're all gonna have to work together. (snaps his fingers and a gnome puts glasses on him) now. you just...  dipper, mabel, soos, wendy and mcgucket: (talk unintelligibly)  soos: don't worry, ford! we're coming for you!  cut to bill unfreezing ford at the fearamid.  ford: let me go, you insane three-sided--! wha--what is this place? (pulls at a chain on his leg)  bill: (rises out of the floor, playing a piano and singing:) we'll meet again. don't know where, don't know when. oh, i know we'll meet again some sunny day.  ford: wh-where am i?  bill: you're in the penthouse suite, kid! the tip of the pyramid. have a drink. (snaps his fingers and a martini glass appears in ford's hand) make yourself comfortable. (takes a sip of his drink as ford sits down) you know that couch is made from living human skin?  the couch groans as eyes, a nose, and a mouth appear. ford jumps up.  ford: aaah! quit the games, cipher! if i'm still alive you must want something from me.  bill: ah, sharp as ever, fordsy. as you may have noticed...i've recently had a (voice echoing:) multi-dimensional makeover. (stops echoing and rearranges the room's furniture) i control space, matter, and now that that dumb baby's out of the way, time itself! but i wasn't always this way. (everything falls to the floor)  ford: ooph!  bill: you think those chains are tight? (eye shows a planet on a two-dimensional plane, which burns) imagine living in the second dimension, flat minds in a flat world with flat dreams. i liberated my dimension, stanford, and i'm here to liberate yours. there's just one hitch. (eye projects a hologram of him pushing against the dome around gravity falls) as it turns out, my weirdness can't escape the magical confines of this town. there's something keeping me in.  ford: incredible! gravity falls natural law of weirdness magnetism. i studied this years ago!  bill: and did you find a way to undo it?  ford: of course. there's a simple equation that could collapse the barrier. but i'd never tell you!  bill: listen, ford, if you just tell me that equation, finally your dimension will be free. (projects himself drawing a smiley face in the midwest united states, then takes a bite out of the earth and flies past his friends, who are destroying other planets, then to ford, who is standing in the middle of a galaxy) anything will be possible. i'll remake a fun world-- a better world! a party that never ends with a host that never dies! no more restrictions! no more laws! you'd be one of us. all-powerful. greater than anything you've imagined! and all i need is your help.  ford: you're insane if you think i'll help you.  bill: ha ha ha! i'm insane either way, brainiac. but have it your way. i'll just fish around and get that equation directly out of your mind! (enters the mental realm)  ford: not so fast! you know the rules, bill. you may be able to haunt my dreams but you can't enter my mind unless i shake your hand and let you in.  bill: (enters the physical realm and sighs, then chains ford's legs and neck) you're making this so much harder than it needs to be. everyone has a weakness, tough guy! i'll make you talk! it's only a matter of time.  ford: (screams)  cut to the mystery shack.  mcgucket: (lays out some blueprints) alright. i've made some thingamadiculous robomajigs in my day, but this is the first one that won't be used for evil.  dipper: whoa! these blueprints are incredible, mcgucket.  mabel: this is your most amazing invention yet.  soos: question, does it have any gun-swords? i watch a lot of anime and, uh, trust me, you're gonna want some gun-swords.  mcgucket: what's an ""anime""?  soos: we have much to discuss.  stan: discuss nothing! these scribbles are a bunch of cockamamie balderdash! excuse my french.  french lilliputtian: je ne sais quoi sacrebleu au revoir! (subtitled:) i don't believe that was french.  stan: and where would you even find a bunch of idiots who would be crazy enough to build it?  mabel: grunkle stan, you're looking at those idiots.  everyone cheers.  soos: idiots!  cut to montage of the refugees building the robot: mcgucket points out the parts needed, then people raid the junkyard; cut to people taking stuff from inside the shack.  stan: whoa-what! what are you--? h-hey now! hey hey! don't touch that! hey! aah!  cut to people digging a dinosaur out from the abandoned mines; soos showing mcgucket anime while the latter takes notes; cuts all the parts being put together and to a ""take back the falls"" flag. cut to everyone outside the shack wearing mabel's sweaters.  soos: thanks for these apocalypse sweaters, mabel. the end of the world has never been so comfortable.  some of the refugees nod and hum in agreement.  pacifica: (shivers; mabel glares at her) uh! fine, i'll wear it. (puts on the llama sweater) but i'm not gonna like it.  mabel: admit it. this is the best day of the end of the world. i think we actually have a chance to beat bill and win back our future.  dipper: yeah. getting to actually live to see our 13th birthday party is the only birthday present i want right now.  soos: hey, if we're lucky enough to get there, i guarantee this whole town is gonna throw you the best birthday party you've ever seen.  dipper: thanks, soos. hey, has anyone seen grunkle stan?  stan: this whole plan is bonkers. but of course no one asked the chief what he thinks. after all i've done for everyone!  shmebulock: shmebulock!  stan: yeah, exactly, it's a total load of shmebulock.  mabel: is something wrong, grunkle stan? you're acting grunklier than usual.  stan: it's this darn plan to save my brother. if you didn't notice, i already saved him once from that portal, and he never thanked me! he causes the end of the world, and somehow it's still always ""stan's the screw-up. ford's the hero.""  dipper: well maybe people think he's a hero because he didn't want to hide in the mystery shack!  stan: well maybe if he hid in the mystery shack, he wouldn't have been captured!  mabel: guys! guys! trust me, tomorrow's gonna be great! i believe in us.  chutzpar: help! leader mabel! i keep accidentally flexing through my sweater. (does so) augh! it happened again!  mabel: those weird cow-monsters are delightful! coming!  cut to the next morning. gompers walks across a barren wasteland and bleats.  mcgucket: alright, fellas. let's hope this turns out better than my other inventions.  mabel: everybody ready? dipper, now!  dipper pulls a lever, causing wheels to turn. machinery begins running and the invention starts moving. as the invention stands up, the refugees are tossed side-to-side inside the shack.  cut to bud gleeful burning some gideon dolls.  bud gleeful: forgive me, boy. your hyperflamable merchandise is the only thing keepin' me going. (as the robot walks past) what in blazes?  the robot approaches the fearamid.  ford: no! no! noooo!!  bill: (zaps him)  ford: aaaagh!  bill: ready to talk now?  ford: (gasping) i won't. i won't let you into my mind.  bill: what do you think, pals? another 500 volts? hey, do you hear that?  the robot's t-rex head crashes through the fearamid and roars.  bill: what?! i just fixed that door!  the mystery shack robot comes into full view.  soos: it's the shacktron, dude! (holds the take back the falls flag, topped with wax larry king's head)  wax larry king: they made the house into a robot. fascinating!  bill: so the mortals are trying to fight back, huh? adorable! henchmaniacs, you know what to do! take them out!  bill's minions grow in size and jump out of the fearamid to stand in front of the mystery shack.  stan: this was a bad idea.  soos: (through a microphone:) uh, hey, dudes. is this thing on? test (feedback screeches) heh. uh, i just wanted you monster dudes to hand over ford or we'll have to, like, fight and junk. heh. hey, you're a little cutie.  paci-fire: i have butchered millions on countless moons.  soos: whoa. i liked you better before you talked. real... real bring down, this guy.  pyronica: attack!  the demons run at the shacktron.  soos: all right, dudes! (runs into the shack)  dipper: everyone! like we planned! three, two, one. go!  candy and grenda: (operate arms, punching away paci-fire and kryptos)  mabel: (uses waddles' mouth to pull a lever, which causes the shacktron to shoot several demons away) ha ha ha. good pig.  waddles: (squeals)  eye bats: (attack the shacktron)  mcgucket: get em, gobblewonker! (operates a gobblewonker head on top of the shacktron, grabbing an eye bat in its mouth)  rumble: (kills two eye bats with fireballs) hya! hya!  wendy: oh, no, you don't! (jumps onto an eye bat and pulls its wings, turning 8 ball's head to stone. wendy jumps off the eye bat back into the shack)  multi-bear: everyone! incoming!  stan: (pulling at a door labeled ""exit"") does this thing have an escape hatch?  zanthar rams the shack and pushes it back. everyone inside screams.  mabel: everybody! maximum power!  sev'ral times: (runs on a treadmill)  dipper: and...now! (turns a wheel and the shacktron grabs zanthar and throws it)  teeth: (runs away on fire, screaming)  bill: guys, seriously? you had, like, one job to do here.  ford: bravo, dipper and mabel!  bill: well, would you look at that. those kids really care about you. and you care about them. (eye turns red; deep voice:) don't you?  ford: what are you....oh. oh no.  bill: perhaps torturing those kids'll make you talk.  ford: no. no! not the kids! you ca-  bill: (turns ford to gold) let's get this over with. (crawls outside, grows a giant fist and slams it down on the shacktron; he raises his fist only to find the shack perfectly fine) what the? no! no! no! no! no! (grows ten arms and pounds at the shack)  stan: ah!  mabel: attack!  grenda: (punches, causing the t-rex head to lunge at bill. it bites bill's eye and pulls back, ripping his eye out.)  bill: aah! my eye! do you have any idea how long it takes to regenerate that?!?  dipper: we've got him distracted. now's our chance.  mabel: rescue team, move out!  mabel puts her grappling hook in her sweater. soos puts the memory erasing gun in his backpack. dipper tests the height-altering crystal flashlight on a mystery shack snowglobe. cut to dipper, mabel, stan, soos, wendy, pacifica and sheriff blubs standing in the exit tubes.  dipper: okay everyone. we get in, rescue ford, get out, save the world. piece of cake.  pacifica: just so we're clear. if i die, i'm suing all of you.  stan: hey, on second thought, maybe we could come up with a plan that doesn't involve us plummeting to our certain death-  wendy: now! (presses a button and they are pulled up out of the tubes and shot out of the gobblewonker's mouth, screaming. they fall towards the fearamid's opening)  dipper: oh, man, oh, man...  mabel: (doing cartwheels through the air) woohoo! hahaha!  they open their parachutes as they approach the fearamid. they all land and remove their parachutes. all of them gasp upon seeing bill's throne.  dipper: oh, man. it looks even worse up close.  mabel: (shoots her grappling hook, which lands on manly dan and pulls herself up to the throne) i found great uncle ford! (tosses the grappling hook down) he's golden. but not in the good way!  stan: great! grab him and let's get out of here.  dipper: but how are we going to unfreeze them?  gideon: (offscreen) i know! (onscreen, dancing in a cage)  mabel: gideon! what happened to you?  gideon: bill captured me. he's been forcing me to do cute dances in this cage for all eternity. (sobbing) i'm so tired of being cute!  dipper: how do we undo this?  gideon: mayor tyler. he's the load-bearing human. pull him out, and the whole thing goes down.  dipper pulls at tyler's arm. he rattles before turning back to normal and breaking free. this sets off a chain reaction, causing the chair to collapse. as it does, the residents are returned to normal. deputy durland hits gideon's cage, knocking it down and breaking it, freeing gideon.  lazy susan: ugh. my mouth tastes like nightmares.  robbie: (falls down on his head) aah! i think i'm dark and tortured for reals now. (a can of spray paint falls out of his hoodie)  tad strange: this experience will forever scar tad strange.  gideon: (rips off his costume) no more sailor suit! (pants)  manly dan and his sons hug wendy.  manly dan: wendy!  wendy: guys!  pacifica: mom! dad!  sheriff blubs: durland!!! (runs to durland, knocking over priscilla and preston)  deputy durland: my blubs!  sheriff blubs: don't you ever scare me like that again. (hugs him)  everyone claps and cheers.  ford: (unfreezes) kids! ah, you did it! i knew i could count on you two. haha! (to mcgucket:) fiddleford. i--i haven't seen you since we parted ways. you must hate me.  mcgucket: i've tried forgettin'. maybe i should try forgiving. come here, old friend. (hugs ford)  stan: hey, good to see you too, bro. now let's get outta here, huh?  dipper: listen, uncle ford, we don't have a lot of time. remember how you told me right before you were frozen that you knew bill's weakness?  mabel: yeah, a secret way to defeat him?  ford: i--i do! (pulls on gloves) now, does anyone have a pen? pencil? anything? (sees robbie's spraypaint can) ah. (grabs the can) perfect. (draws with the spraypaint)  dipper: uh, we've got bill outside, but i don't know how long we can keep him occupied.  ford: yes, yes. good, good.  stan: drawing a circle on the floor. well, he's lost his mind.  ford: my mind is fine. and there is a way to beat him. with this.  shot pulls back to show that ford has drawn the zodiac.  pacifica: the world's most confusing game of hopscotch?  ford: no, a prophecy. although it would be a pretty fun game of hopscotch. (cut to ford as a young man in a cave approaching a painting of bill's wheel. voice-over from the present:) many years ago i found ten symbols in a cave. some i recognized then, some i only recognize now. the native people of gravity falls prophesied that these symbols could create a force strong enough to vanquish bill. with bill defeated, his weirdness would be reversed and the town could be saved. (flashback ends) this whole time i thought it was just superstition. but seeing you all here now, i finally understand that it's destiny. dipper, the pine tree. mabel, the shooting star.  dipper and mabel: (step on their respective spots)  soos: the question mark. this one's unsolvable.  wendy: (pushes robbie onto the broken heart symbol) that one's easy. you've been rockin' that dumb hoodie since the seventh grade.  robbie: whoa. destiny hoodie.  dipper: the tent of telepathy sign! that must be gideon.  gideon: (stands on it) whoo! an excuse to stand next to mabel.  mabel: don't turn this into a big deal.  gideon: oh, i won't! (whispering:) i will.  cut to bill with the shacktron. it punches him and holds him to the ground.  bill: (noticies the leg outside of the shield) what the... hey, <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/achilles"" title=""wikipedia:achilles"">achillles! nice work with the heel! (rips off the leg) fore! (hits the shack with the leg and it rolls away)  cut to inside the fearamid.  ford: hold hands, everyone. this is a mystical human energy circuit.  dipper: ice? who's ice?  ford: the symbols needn't all be literal, dipper. it just has to be someone cool in the face of danger.  lee, nate, tambry, thompson: wendy! wendy!  wendy: heheh. shut up, you guys. (stands on the ice bag symbol)  ford: much like the spectacles need to be someone scholarly.  mcgucket: (stands on the glasses symbol) heeheh!  pacifica: (stands on the llama symbol and looks at the llama sweater she's wearing) this is freaky.  ford: now hold hands, everyone.  mcgucket: (holds out his hand, which has flies around it, to pacifica)  pacifica: ew! i'm not touching that.  preston: do it, sweetie. do the one thing no one in our family has ever done: touch the hillbilly.  pacifica: (holds mcgucket's hand and everyone in the circle glows. thunder rumbles and smoke circles around the fearamid.)  dipper: great uncle ford! i think it's working!  mcgucket: hoohoo! heehahahaha!  ford: yes! this is it! (to the people outside the circle:) the rest of you get out. it's too dangerous!  the people not in the circle run away.  ford: we just need one more person...stanley! stanley, get over here. you're the only one left.  stan: you realize this is a bunch of hogwash, right? you really think some caveman graffiti is gonna stop that monster?  gideon: dang it, old man! now's not the time!  wendy: come on!  pacifica: what are you doing? you're gonna ruin this!  robbie: i've never held hands this long and i am very uncomfortable.  stan: whoa. hey. i'm not the enemy here, people. don't forget who literally created the end of the world.  ford: i'm sorry, stanley. i know. just help me fix it. please.  stan: fine. just do one thing. say ""thank you.""  ford: what?  stan: i spent thirty years trying to bring you back into this dimension and you still haven't thanked me! you want me to shake your hand? say ""thank you.""  ford: fine. thank you.  stan: (holds ford's and soos' hands) now, see. between me and him, i'm not always the bad twin.  ford: between ""him and me."" (beat) grammar, stanley.  stan: i'll ""grammar stanley"" you! (lets go of soos' hand and hits ford) you stuck up son of a gun! i mean come on!  ford: (lets go of robbie's hand and hits stanley) don't jeopardize this, you idiot! everything's on the line!  mabel: guys, stop it!  dipper and mabel pull at stan and ford, who are fighting and yelling unintelligibly at each other.  dipper: join hands!  ford and stan stop fighting as bill approaches.  bill: oh no, it's bill! right? isn't that what you're all thinking? hey, gideon, why aren't you dancing? chop chop, huh?  cut to first end card.  bill: ha ha ha ho! this is just too perfect! didn't you brainiacs know the zodiac doesn't work if you don't all hold hands? and what's better, you've brought every threat to my power together in one easy-to-destroy circle! (burns the circle)  dipper: oh no!  pacifica: (notices that her hair is on fire and pats it) ah! my hair!  robbie: (notices that his hair is on fire and pats it) ah! my hair also!  bill: (grabs stan and ford) you guys wanna see what happens to your friends when you can't get along?  mcgucket: hey! you give them back!  gideon: you've gone too far, cipher!  wendy: yeah! we're not scared of you! (grabs her ax)  mcgucket: (grabs his banjo)  bill: oh, but you should be. (snaps and everyone except dipper, mabel, ford, and stan floats up beside him)  mabel: ah!  dipper: oh no!  bill: you know, this castle could really use some decorations! (the people who he was holding up are replaced by tapestries with pictures of them screaming in front of their symbols) looks like it's too late for your friends, stanford.  dipper and mabel scream as a cage encases them.  stan: ah! kids!  bill: but you can still save your family. last chance: tell me how to take weirdmageddon global and i'll spare the kids!  dipper: no! don't do it!  mabel: yeah! bill makes bad deals!  bill: don't you toy with me, shooting star. i see everythi--! (eye shows a picture of a galaxy; as mabel sprays paint in his eye) ow! not again! why?! every time!  stan: nice shot, pumpkin.  ford and stan are released from bill's arms and fall to the ground.  bill: i just regenerated that eye!  mabel: i know that hurts because i've accidentally done it to myself! multiple times!  dipper pulls out the height-altering crystal flashlight and enlarges their cage. dipper and mabel jump out as bill continues to scream in pain.  dipper: save yourselves. run! we'll take care of bill!  ford: what? that's a suicide mission!  dipper: trust us. we've beat him before...  mabel: ...and we'll beat him again! (fist bumps dipper) hey! bill! come and get us, you pointy jerk!  bill growls. dipper and mabel run off into the fearamid. before leaving, mabel stretches her lips to blow a raspberry.  ford: what? no! it's too dangerous!  ford and stan start to run after dipper and mabel, but bill puts them in a cage.  bill: (opens eye) not so fast. you two wait here! (turns red and grows six arms) i've got some children i need to make into corpses. (deep voice:) seeya real soon. (runs off)  stan: no! wait! no! no! oh, what do we do? what do we do?!  ford: (bangs on bars) kids!  dipper and mabel run through the fearamid, with bill chasing them.  bill: when i get my hands on you kids, i'm gonna dissasemble your molecules! you've tricked me for the last time! (tries to grab them, but they fly away on the grappling hook)  cut to ford and stan.  stan: oh, i can't believe this. the kids are gonna die and it's all my fault. because i couldn't shake your stupid hand! uh, dad was right about me. i am a screw-up.  ford: ah, don't blame yourself. i'm the one who made a deal with bill in the first place. i fell for all his easy flattery. you would have seen him for the scam artist he is.  stan: how did things get so messed up between us?  ford: we used to be like dipper and mabel. the world's about to end and they still work together. how do they do it?  stan: easy. they're kids. they don't know any better. (as ford stands up) whoa, where you goin'?  ford: i'm going to play the only card we have left. let bill into my mind. he'll be able to take over the galaxy and maybe even worse, but at least he might let the kids free.  stan: what?! are you kiddin' me?! are you honestly telling me there's nothing else we can do?!  ford: bill's only weak in the mind space. if i didn't have this darn plate in my head we could just erase him with the memory gun when he steps inside my mind.  stan: what if he goes into my mind? my brain isn't good for anything.  ford: heheh. there's nothing in your mind he wants. it has to be me. we need to take his deal. it's the only way he'll agree to save you and the kids.  stan: do you really think he's gonna make good on that deal?  ford: what other choice do we have?  cut to dipper and mabel running through the fearamid. they scream as they reach a dead end.  dipper: you know, i'm starting to think there's no way out of here.  mabel: like grunkle stan always says, when one door closes, choose a nearby wall and bash it in with brute force! (grows her hand with the flashlight and punches through the wall) ahhh! (shrinks her hand back to normal)  dipper: ha! now let's round up the townsfolk and together we can defeat...oh, no! (sees the rest of the refugees tied on the ground, guarded by the demons)  grenda: you'll never take us alive, monsters!  teeth: that's fine with us! (eats shmebulock)  dipper: oh, no.  bill: peeka-boo! (catches them in a tractor beam)  dipper and mabel: aaah!  bill: (re-enters the main room with dipper and mabel in his hand) alright, ford. time's up. i've got the kids. i think i'm gonna kill one of 'em now just for the heck of it! eenie..meenie...minee (eye switches between the pine tree and shooting star symbol with each word, then ends on the shooting star)...you!! (holds up his other hand)  stan: (wearing ford's clothes and imitating ford's voice) wait! i surrender.  bill: good choice. (drops dipper and mabel)  ford: (wearing stan's clothes and imitating stan's voice) don't do it, ford, it'll destroy the universe!!  stan: it's the only way.  bill: hahahaha! oh, even when you're about to die, you pines twins just can't get along. (drops the cage and ties up ford)  stan: my only condition is that you let my brother and the kids go!  bill: fine.  dipper: no, grunkle ford! don't trust him!  bill: it's a...deal! (holds stan's hand, then enters the mental realm) ahaha! hahaha! ahahahahaha! (enters stan's mind) oh, i'm here. i'm finally here! look at this place: a perfect, calm, orderly void. gotta hand it to ya, ford. you really know how to clear your m-- (opens the door to see stan on his chair in the mystery shack's living room with a paddleball)  stan: (makes a clicking sound and points a finger-gun at bill)  bill: what?!  stan: heh heh! do a pretty good impression of my brother, don't i? switch clothes and no one can tell us apart. welcome to my mind. surprised you didn't recognize it.  outside of stan's mind, ford takes off stan's fez and pulls out the memory erasing gun. he enters ""stanley pines"" and aims it at his brother. cut back to stan's mind.  bill: what?! the deal's off!! (turns around but the door shuts) what the...no, no, no, no!  the room starts to burn with blue fire.  stan: oh yeah. you're going down, bill. you're gettin' erased. memory gun. pretty clever, huh?  bill: y-you idiot! don't you realize you're destroying your own mind, too?!  stan: eh. it's not like i was using this space for much, anyway.  bill: let me outta here! let me out! (grunts) why isn't this working?!  stan: hey, look at me. turn around and look at me, you one-eyed demon! you're a real wise-guy, but you made one fatal mistake: you messed with my family.  bill: you're making a mistake! i'll give you anything! (eye shows a picture of a dollar sign, a star, a pot of gold and a galaxy) money! fame! riches! infinite power! your own galaxy! please! (bends and melts) no! what's happening to me?! (flashes between several distorted forms; spoken in reverse:) a-x-o-l-o-t-l! my time has come to burn! i invoke the ancient power that i may return! (speaking normally:) staaannlleeeey!  stan: (punches bill in the eye, breaking him up into many pieces; pants, then picks up a picture of him with dipper, mabel and waddles) heh. guess i was good for something after all.  the flames engulf him. cut to outside of stan's mind. once ford finishes erasing stan's memory he drops the memory erasing gun. the others from the wheel return to normal and drop to the floor. outside of the fearamid, the rift sucks all of the demons back into the nightmare realm through the portal. teeth spits out shmebulock as he gets pulled away.  the horrifying sweaty one-armed monstrosity: hey! hey!  the fearamid is deconstructed and pulled into the rift. once it is gone, a wave washes over the town, restoring it to its pre-weirdmageddon state. the townsfolk look around, and xyler, craz and rumble mcskirmish all fade away. the forest is shown with a bird landing on a statue of bill, covered in moss and vegetation. cut to another part of the forest with stan still collapsed on the ground. he opens his eyes.  mabel: (runs up to stan and puts his fez on him) oh, my gosh! grunkle stan, you did it!  stan: oh, uh, hey there...kiddo. what's your name?  mabel: eheh. grunkle stan?  stan: heh. (looks around) who you talkin' to?  mabel: c-cmon. it's me. it's me, grunkle stan. (as dipper pulls her back) grunkle stan, it's me!  ford: we had to erase his mind to defeat bill. it's all gone. stan has no idea, but he did it. he saved the world. he saved me. (kneels down next to stan) you're our hero, stanley. (hugs him)  mabel sits down and cries. dipper puts his hand on her shoulder and cries as well. cut to everyone in front of the mystery shack, which is laying in a heap in the woods. they walk up to the door. dipper punches the door until it comes down. everyone walks into the living room, dipper and mabel holding stan's hands.  stan: hey, this is a real nice place you got here.  dipper: it's your place, grunkle stan.  mabel: don't you remember? even a little?  stan: (sitting down in the recliner) nope. but this chair hugs my butt like it remembers. ah. (looks at everyone else, who are looking at him sadly) hey, why the long faces? you guys look like it's someone's funeral. (whispering:) who's that big guy crying in the corner?  soos: (sobs and turns away)  dipper: we saved the world, but what's the point? grunkle stan's not himself anymore.  mabel: there's gotta be something we can do to jog his memory.  ford: there isn't. i'm sorry. stan's gone.  mabel: i know my grunkle is in there somewhere. there's gotta be something around here that can help bring him back. (grabs her scrapbook, sits next to stan in the recliner and opens it) this'll work! this has to work! here's the first day we came to gravity falls, grunkle stan. and here's a macaroni interpretation of my emotions. (flips through the pages)  dipper: that time we went fishing? that summerween we spent together? don't you remember anything?  stan: i'm sorry. i don't know what this is or who you are or-  waddles: (jumps up on stan)  stan: gah! quit it, waddles! i'm trying to remember my life story!  dipper and mabel: (gasp)  dipper: what did you say?  stan: i said get waddles off of me.  ford: (gasps) it's working. keep reading.  soos: skip to my page! he needs to remember our boss-employee relationship.  stan: hey, just cuz i have amnesia, don't go tryin' to give yourself a raise, soos. (sits in the chair)  dipper: it's happening! keep going!  mabel: okay. okay. ""day two. grunkle stan smells weird but we're starting to bond. he told us a lot about being a business man in the '80s and seemed happy when we pretended to listen. he also gave me a grappling hook which everyone is impressed by. and in more important news, i met some neighborhood hotties."" (laughs)  everyone else laughs with her. cut to a woodpecker landing on the welcome to gravity falls sign. a gnome pops up and eats the bird.  shandra: (offscreen) good morning, gravity falls. it's another beautiful day, but every day is beautiful now that the...unpleasantness is over.  lazy susan: (wipes a drawing of bill off of her window)  sprott: (chasing some eye bats out of his barn) git outta here, you ornery critters!  cut to a zombie popping out of the ground. greg valentino pushes it back into the ground with his foot.  greg: ah, good as new. (to janice, who pushes one in the ground with a shovel as another grabs her leg:) oh! looks like you've got a friend.  janice: robbie, would you be a dear and get us the sawed-off shotgun?  robbie: ugh. fine! whatever!  mayor befufftlefumpter: (pops out of the ground as a zombie) brains, and so forth.  janice: nope. none of that, thank you. (pushes him back into the ground and she and greg laugh)  cut to tyler cutebiker standing on a podium in front of a crowd.  tyler: none of us really understand what just happened and none of us want to. that's why i'm passing the never mind all that act. if anyone goes asking around about the ""events"" of the last few days, what do we say? (a banner saying ""never mind all that"" drops)  crowd: never mind all that!  sheriff blubs: and if you break the rules, we're gonna zap you.  deputy durland: (waving tasers) zap! zap! we're mad with power!  sheriff blubs and deputy durland: (drop their tasers and grab each others' faces) and love.  shandra jimenez: (offscreen:) in other news, the northwest family has gone broke. after pledging his allegiance to bill and then placing all his savings in weirdness bonds, preston northwest had to sell his mansion to preserve his family fortune.  cut to preston and priscilla crying as the some workers hand a ""for sale"" banner on the gate.  priscilla: (to pacifica:) you're only going to have one pony now.  shot closes in on pacifica's horrified face accompanied by dramatic music.  shandra: but fortunes have also turned for local maniac, fiddleford mcgucket, who, after regaining his sanity, has made millions overnight submitting his patents to the us government.  mcgucket: i'm gonna buy me a bigger shed! (pointing to the northwest manor) hey, that one's for sale!  shandra: in other good news, town hero, stanley pines, has fully recovered his memory and will be throwing a party to celebrate his niece and nephew's thirteenth birthday and final day in town. but other than that, i can safely say our beloved gravity falls is back to normal. and now, bodacious t, with sports.  toby determined: (holding a skull and bat) it's called, ""death ball.""  cut to dipper and mabel standing in front of a cake with many townsfolk.  crowd: (singing:) <a class=""extiw"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/happy_birthday_to_you"" title=""wikipedia:happy birthday to you"">...to you. (cheers)  mabel: i can't believe you all got together just to throw a party for us.  tyler: after all the pines family has done for the town, it's the least we could do. you've helped everyone here.  gideon: thanks to y'all savin' us, i'm gonna learn to open my heart to kindness. no more evil-doin'. from now on, i'm gonna try to be li'l gideon, regular ol' kid.  cut to gideon at a park on a skateboard.  gideon: wa--oh! woo! i'm bustin' a move on this skatin' board.  boy: (walking past gideon) more like busting your pants, loser. (laughs)  gideon looks over at ghost-eyes and killbone on the teeter-totter. he snaps his fingers and the two go after the boy. offscreen, they beat him up and the boy screams. gideon giggles. cut back to the party.  soos: dude! make a wish, dawg.  dipper: you know, on my first day here, if you had asked me what i wanted, i would have said, ""adventure, mystery, true friends."" but looking here at all of you i realize that every wish came true. (chuckles) i have everything i wanted.  mabel: if i had only one wish it would be to shrink all of you with the shrink ray and bring you home with us in my pocket. but since that's impossible... (to ford:) is that impossible?  ford: (waves his hand up and down and shrugs)  mabel: since that's probably impossible, my only wish is for everyone to sign my scrapbook. i'll never forget you guys. wait. (sets the memory gun on the floor and smashes it) now i'll never forget you guys. (she and dipper blow out the candles)  wendy: (hugs them) i now officially declare you technically teenagers. welcome to angst and acne forever.  wendy, tambry, robbie, lee, nate and thompson: one of us! one of us!  blubs and durland: woopee! (fire a cannon)  soos: so how do you feel?  mabel: same-y, but different-y.  pacifica: hey, you two. when are you gonna open your presents already? i broke a nail wrapping them.  mabel: (she and dipper laugh) pacifica.  dipper and mabel each grab a present. stan claps.  ford: stanley, i need to talk to you. (leads him behind the shack) i didn't wanna say anything with everyone listening, but we've got a problem. weirdmageddon has been contained but i'm detecting some strange new anomalies near the arctic ocean. (shows a holographic map of the world on his watch) i want to go investigate it but i think i might be too old to go it alone.  stan: are you sayin' you need someone to help you sail around the world in the adventure of a lifetime?  ford: i don't just want someone to come with me stanley, i want it to be you. (gives him a photo of them as kids posing on the stan-o-war) will you give me a second chance?  stan: you think we'll find treasure? and babes?  ford: heh! i'd say there's a high probability. but, what should we do with the mystery shack?  stan: i think the town's had enough mystery for one lifetime. are you thinkin' what i'm thinkin'?  stan and ford start talking unintelligibly. soos walks up behind them, eating cake, and gasps when he overhears their conversation. cut to stan and ford on the porch with dipper and mabel.  stan: (tapping a pitt cola bottle) everyone, i have an announcement to make. me and my...heh!... nerdy bro over here have some catchin' up to do. we're gonna be away for a while. that's why i'm shutting down the mystery shack for good.  crowd: (gasp and murmur)  soos: you shut down your mouth for good! (beat) i'm sorry, mr. pines. it's just that this shack is the most magical place on earth. sure, the attractions are all fake, but dreams aren't fake! (holds up a fiji mermaid taxidermy) like, this mermaid. it's not just a dead fish butt sewn to a monkey carcass. it's a marvelous creature that makes us believe that anything is possible. you shut down this shack, and you shut down our dreams! at least...my dreams.  crowd: aww.  stan: (sighs) i'm sorry, soos. it's just, there's no one around to run it. at least, there wouldn't be if i hadn't just found the perfect replacement. (puts his fez on soos) ladies and gentleman, the mystery shack is under new management.  crowd: (cheers)  soos: you...you mean it, mr. mystery?  stan: you're mr. mystery now, soos. try not to burn the place down.  abuelita: (carrying luggage and assorted items, with a 'movers' truck in tow) i'll move in immediately.  the partygoers keep cheering. cut to the mystery shack later that evening. the screen shows the empty attic. cut to the pines, soos, wendy, candy, grenda and waddles at the bus stop.  candy: do you really have to go? there's still so much we haven't done together.  mabel: summer's over, candy. it's time for us to grow up.  dipper: but not too much.  grenda: aaah! i hate my dumb heart for making me feel things. (punches herself) cut. it. out. heart!  soos: hey, can you punch my heart, too?  candy: no, mine! punch my feelings away.  mabel: (hugs candy and grenda) candy and grenda, thank you for being my people. you'll always be my best friends. grunkle stan, thanks for wearing my goodbye sweater.  stan: ah, it's cold out. i had to.  soos: what? but it's like eighty-something degrees out today.  stan and ford: can it, soos!  dipper, mabel, candy and grenda laugh.  wendy: (kneels next to dipper) hey, you mean a lot to me, man.  dipper: (fist-bumps wendy) you, too.  wendy: (switches hats with dipper) something to remember me by. (handing dipper a letter) oh, and this. read it the next time you miss gravity falls.  a bus pulls up.  bus driver: last bus leaving gravity falls. all aboard.  mabel: guess we've said goodbye to everyone except...waddles. i...i don't know how to explain this but... (sighs) mom and dad won't let me bring a pig home to california so... you have to stay here!  waddles: (pulls mabel's skirt)  mabel: (trying to push waddles off of her; starts to cry) come on. come on. i have to go. i'm...i'm sorry, waddles.  stan: agh! you know what? forget it! i lived with this pig all summer, now your parents are gonna have to. (puts waddles on the bus) hey, bus guy! this pig is comin' with the kids.  bus driver: now, hold on a second. bringing animals aboard a moving vehicle is strictly prohibited by--  stan pulls out his brass knuckles and ford shows his gun.  bus driver: wah...w-w-welcome aboard. you can sit in the front row, pig.  stan: kids, you knuckleheads were nothin' but a nuisance and i'm glad to be rid of ya.  mabel: (she and dipper hug him) we'll miss you too, grunkle stan.  dipper: ready to head into the unknown?  mabel: nope. let's do it.  they get on the bus and it drives away. everyone runs after the bus shouting their farewells.  mabel: bye! bye, everybody! we'll miss you.  dipper: bye! i'll miss you guys, too!  ford puts his hand on stan's shoulder.  dipper: (narrating:) if you've ever taken a road trip through the pacific northwest, you've probably seen a bumper sticker for a place called gravity falls.  cut to mcgucket walking into the northwest manor. he drops his sack and banjo on the ground.  mcgucket: well, i've moved in.  dipper: it's not on any maps, and most people have never heard of it. some people think it's a myth. but if you're curious, don't wait.  at the mystery shack, soos unveils a statue of stan. the kids run away screaming. cut to ford and stan on a boat. a giant squid attacks them and stan punches it. cut to dipper and mabel on the bus and mabel is asleep.  dipper: take a trip. find it. it's out there somewhere in the woods. waiting. (opens the letter, which has signatures from various people and says ""see you next summer.""; dipper smiles)  we then see the scrolling closing credits in the form of mabel's scrapbook with various pictures such as waddles playing with the bubble; dipper and mabel setting off firecrackers; mabel doing crazy poses while taking a selfie such as blowing a dandelion and ""eating"" a sun; wendy makes a ""crazy face"" in front of the camera; dipper clones #3 and #4 relaxing under the tent during the rain; stan trying out the grappling hook while holding ford; mabel painting ford's fingers; old man mcgucket, his raccoon wife, and his son tate relaxing in the pool; quentin trembley looking yonder at gravity falls while sitting on his horse backwards; mabel, grenda and candy doing quick poses in a photo booth; the pines family watching tv and then fall asleep the next day; some objects in the mystery shack like the antique diving helmet and the jar of eyeballs; a tree shows a number of heart carvings with one of them saying mabel+gabe, possibly about mabel's ex-boyfriends; a snack bar in the mystery shack where a kid takes one cookie bag; grenda and candy during the final days of summer traveling in the yacht with marius von fundshauser when grenda vigorously kisses him; and the final picture before the credits end shows dipper and mabel with waddles sleeping in the bus seat as they reach their hometown of piedmont, california.  before the series ends with the last end card, there is a live action shot of bill's petrified statue hidden in the woods.
