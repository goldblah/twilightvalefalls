ROD SERLING

Air Date: June 10, 1960

1. Shot (Art) of an odd-looking sky

Strange clouds drift across the sky. PAN DOWN for LONG ANGLE
SHOT of a road that stretches out across a barren landscape
punctuated by odd rock croppings and an occasional gnarled—
branched tree. The CAMERA STARTS MOVING DOWN this road at a
fast clip heading toward a far—out horizon. Over this we
hear a Narrator‘s Voice.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

This highway leads to the shadowy
tip of reality. A through—route to
the land of the different, the
bizarre, the unexplainable.

(a pause)
You go as far as you like on this
road. Its limits are only those of
the mind itself. Ladies and gentlemen,
you're entering the wondrous dimension
of imagination. Next stop—

At this moment we've reached the end of the road and are

just a moment away from what appears to be a precipice leading
out into nothingness. Concurrent with the next line of
narration, the lettering springs up in front of the camera
almost as if on a hinge.

NARRATOR'S VOICE (CONT‘D)
The Twilight Zone!

CAMERA MOVES through into the lettering, smashing it into
bits and then continuing on through until we are suspended
in night sky. A SLOW PAN DOWN to opening shot of the play.

2. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE MAIN FLOOR [DAY] LONG ANGLE SHOT
LOOKING DOWN

A humdrum of activity. Customers going to and fro. The
occasional gong, gong, gong of a floorwalkers' signal. The
constant opening and shutting of elevator doors, etc. CAMERA
FANS DOWN SLOWLY until it is eye level with the customers
who move toward the elevators and the others that come out
from behind it, moving away from it. PAN LEFT for MED. LONG
SHOT of Marsha White as she stops hesitantly in front of the
tier of elevators, finding them all closed.

3. Med. close shot Marsha As she looks down the line of
elevators.

4. Reverse angle looking toward last elevator on left Its
door just opening as she looks at it. A young operator sticks
his head out, beckons to her.

OPERATOR
Going up, ma'am.

(CONTINUED)

2.

5. Track shot Marsha As she approaches the elevator and then
steps inside.

MARSHA
Housewares?

OPERATOR
That would be mezzanine, ma'am. What
in particular were you looking for?

MARSHA
Thimbles. Gold thimbles. You had
them advertised.

OPERATOR
That would be Specialties, ma'am.
Ninth floor.

6. Different angle Marsha As seen from outside looking in
toward elevator. The operator's hand raises preparatory to
closing the door.

7. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING OUTSIDE-FROM ELEVATOR MARSHA' P.O.V.

There are long lines of people gathered, waiting for the
elevators, but none of them even come close to the one she's
in.

8. Reverse angle looking toward her As she looks puzzled for
a moment, a look that is shut off by the closing doors.
9. INT. ELEVATOR TWO SHOT MARSHA AND OPERATOR

She studies the back of his head as the elevator goes up
slowly and almost noiselessly.

MARSHA
(smiling)
I‘m not accustomed to such service.

OPERATOR
(without turning)
Ma'am?
MARSHA

There were a lot of people waiting
for elevators. I seem to have a
private one.

OPERATOR
(how turns to her)
This is the express, ma'am, to the
ninth floor. The others are locals
at this time of day.

With this he abruptly turns his back again. The CAMERA MOVES
UP to Marsha's face. The smile persists, but she feels a

(CONTINUED)

3.

sense of oddness in the attitude of the operator and a feeling
of disquiet. There's nothing very concrete in her concerns.
Nothing that could be articulated. CAMERA FANS over to the
floor indicator with the little red and green lights that

pop on and Off as the car makes its ascent. Over this shot

we hear the Narrator's Voice.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
Express elevator to the ninth floor
of a department store carrying Miss
Marsha White on a most prosaic,
ordinary, run-of-the-mill errand.

Now the light hits number nine on the indicator. The elevator
slows to a stop. The door slides open. ABRUPT CUT TO:

10. Marsha's face As she stares out at the floor.

11. Reverse angle looking out Toward an absolutely empty and
quiet department. Empty display cases, empty aisles, devoid
of movement or sound or people.

OPERATOR
Ninth floor.

Marsha walks out tentatively, stands looking around, then
whirls around, speaking as she does.

MARSHA (CONT'D)
There must be some mistake. There's
no one up-

CUT TO:
12. ELEVATOR DOORS

Just as they close. Then a QUICK PAN UP to the floor indicator
above the elevator doors as it starts its descent. PAN BACK
to MARSHA'S FACE as she looks around, nOw very disquieted.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

Miss Marsha White on the ninth floor,
Specialties department, looking for
a gold thimble.

(a pause)
The odds are that she'll find it,
but there are even better odds that
she'll find something else because
this isn't just a department store.
This happens to be...the Twilight
Zone!

FADE TO BLACK: OPENING BILLBOARD—FIRST COMMERCIAL‘FADE ON

(CONTINUED)

13. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE NINTH FLOOR TRACK SHOT

Marsha as she walks down a lonesome aisle, looking left and
right, occasionally stopping to whirl around and stare behind
her.

14. Different angle As she stops by one counter and looks
down.

15. Slow pan across the glass Nothing is in it. PAN BACK UP
to Marsha's face as she looks off in bewilderment. She turns
and moves across toward the counters on the other side of
the aisle.

16. Med. long shot the counters These too have no merchandise
in them whatsoever.

17. Angle shot looking down on Mersha

As she pauses for a moment as if trying to make a decision,
then turns and walks back toward the elevators.

18. Med. close shot the elevators As she pushes the button,
then steps back, waits for a moment, pushes the button again,
this time with more persistence. She looks up toward the
floor indicator. The arrow remains pointed to "G".

19. Close shot Marsha As a look of concern crosses her face,
nothing akin yet to panic, nothing that could be construed
as even a fear. Just a carry—over of the disquiet of before
and a suggestion of a grOWing irritation. Suddenly smashing
into the silence is a woman‘s voice.

WOMAN'S VOICE
Was someone helping you?

20. Different angle Marsha As she whirls around, wide—eyed.
tanding a few feet beyond her, alongside one of the empty
counters, is a strikingly attractive woman in her early
forties, her hair tied severely back in a bun, chic and
tasteful in her dress, her voice modulated and pleasant. She
looks a little amused at Marsha now.

WOMAN
Can I show you something?

MARSHA
((taking step toward
her, a little
flustered)
Why...why, yes. I was looking for a
gold thimble. A gift for my mother.

21. Close shot on the woman

(CONTINUED)

WOMEN
A gold thimble? I think we have
something you‘d like. This way,
please.

She turns and walks to the other end of the counter. Marsha
follows her.

22. Two shot at the end of the counter As the woman reaches
down behind the counter.

23. Close shot Marsha As her eyes follow her.

24. Close shot through the glass Of a single gold thimble
resting inside a small velvet box that is all by itself.
There isn't another thing on display. We see the woman's
hand lift it out and then put it on top of the counter.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
How about this? It's fourteen—carat
gold and quite distinctive—looking I
think, don't you?

25. Two shot As Marsha picks up the small box and studies
it, then looks up at the woman.

MARSHA
Yes. I think this will do.

WOMAN
((taking out an order
book and a pencil)
This is a Charge?

A silence as Marsha studies her.

WOMAN (CONT'D)
(repeating, gently)
Is this a charge, miss?

26. Close shot Marsha Suddenly shaken out of her day dreaming.

MBRSHA
I beg your pardon? A charge? No...no,
I'll pay for it.

27. Two shot

WOMAN
Do you want it gift wrapped?

MARSHA
Yes, please.
(then hurriedly
correcting)
On second thought, no...I'll wrap it
myself.

(CONTINUED)

WOMAN
(scratches on pad)
Twenty—two eighty, plus tax. Twenty—
five dollars even.

Marsha hurriedly takes out two bills from her wallet, hands
them to the woman who immediately sticks them inside an order
book.

28. Close shot Marsha As her eyes go down to look once again
through the glass.

MERSHA
That's odd.

29. Angle shot looking up through the glass at the woman

As she writes out the ticket.

30. Same angle moving over to Marsha‘s face through glass

WOMAN
What is, Marsha?

MARSHA
You don't have any merchandise here
at all...except the thimble. Except
the very thing I needed. The whole
floor looks so empty and—

She stops abruptly.
CUT TO:
31. Two shot the two of them

MARSHA {CONT'D)
You called me Marsha.

WOMAN
(with half—smile)
Did I? I'm sorry. That was forward
of me. I apologize.

She takes a paper bag from a shelf behind and starts to put
the small box into it.

MARSHA
How did you know my name?
WOMAN
I‘ve probably seen you around the

store-

(CONTINUED)

MARSHA

(persistently)
No you haven't. I've never seen you.
Look...I don‘t want to make a thing
of this, but...what kind of a place
is this? I mean...I want just one
small item - a gold thimble - and I
come up on a floor where there isn‘t
a single thing in evidence excegt
the very thing I'm looking for. Now
you may be a little more sophisticated
than I am, but this I call gggi

The woman keeps her back to her for a moment, then closes up
the bag, turns to her, puts it on the counter.

WOMAN
Please come again.
(a pause)
Any time.

32. Extremely tight close shot Marsha.As she studies the
woman.

33. Extremely tight close shot woman
34. Two shot

MARSHA
((now just in a hurry
to get away and
nothing else, murmurs)
Thank you.

She turns, walking toward the elevator.

35. Different angle As she arrives at the elevator and pushes
the button. QUICK PAN UP to the floor indicator. This time
the arrow starts to head toward the ninth floor.

36. Long angle shot looking over Marsha's shoulder The woman
standing behind the counter.

WOMAN
Miss White.

Marsha turns to her.

WOMEN (CONT'D)
((with great
simplicity, very
matter of factly, as
if commenting on the
weather)
Are you happy?

(CONTINUED)

MARSHA

I beg your pardon?

(a pause)
Am I what? Am I happy?

(she shakes her head,

smiling at the strange

non sequitur}
You'll forgive me, but...it's really
none of your business.

37. Med. close shot woman Who throws back her head and laughs.

WOMAN
Really? It's none of my business?
All right, Miss White. Suit yourself.
It's none of my business.

There's the sound of the elevator doors opening and they
cause Marsha to whirl around to face them. The same young
operator is at the controls.

OPERATOR
Going down.

Marsha hurriedly steps inside the elevator.
38. LONG SHOT WOMAN BY THE COUNTER MmRSEA'S P.O.V.

She stands there, with an enigmatic smile on her face which
is shut off by closing doors.

39. INT. ELEVATOR
As it goes down. Marsha keeps studying the young man.

OPERATOR
Find what you were looking for?

MARSHA

((reaches into the

bag and takes out

the small box)
As a matter of fact, I did. Also as
a matter of fact, that's the only
thing for sale on that floor. Somebody
better latch onto an efficiency expert
or something. One entire department
devoted to the sale of a single gold
thimble. And an extremely oddball
saleslady who somebody ought to look
into!

40. Close shot the box In Marsha‘s hand as she opens it and
takes out the thimble.

(CONTINUED)

MARSHA {CONT'D}
This is scratched! I didn't notice
that before. I can't send this to my
mother. It's terribly scratched. And
it's dented too! See here?

 

She proffers it to the operator. He keeps his back turned.

OPERATOR
Main floor.

MARSHA
Look at this thing. It's scratched
and it looks like someone stepped on
it or something.

OPERATOR
(noncommitally)
Main floor.

The doors open and Marsha, seeing that he refuses to even
look at the thimble, shoves it back in the bag and flounces
out of the elevator.

CUT TO:

41. INT. MR. SLOAN'S OFFICE (THE STORE MANAGER) FULL SHOT OF
THE ROOM

As he sits behind the desk. In front of him stands the
floorwalker, Mr. Armbruster, a Franklin Pangborn type ultra—
serious little man whose well—ordered life encloses nothing
but the department store, a fresh boutonniere, and a well-
pressed suit. He's in the middle of a long explanation.

ARMBRUSTER
well I distinctly told her that all
the gold thimbles we have would be
in Gifts. And that if the item were
damaged we would certainly make it
good either by replacement or refund.
I distinctly told her that, Mr. Sloan—

SLOAN
(very, very bored)
Then what's the problem, Mr.
Armbruster?

ARMBRUSTER
The problem is that the customer
claims she didn't get the item in
Gifts. She got it in another
department.

(CONTINUED)

lO.

SLOAN

((lighting a cigarette,

shakes his head back

and forth with

strained patience)
Then, Mr. Armbruster...have her go
to the department where she purchased
the item.

ARMBRUSTER
That's the point, Mr. Sloan. She has
some idiotic story about having
purchased the gold thimble on the
ninth floor.

SLQKN
The ninth floor? I trust you explained
to her, Mr. Armbruster, that this
store doesn't have a ninth floor?

ARMBRUSTER

Mr. Sloan, believe me, sir, I have
tried desperately - I really mean
desperately — to acquaint her with
this fact, but she insists she was
taken up to the ninth floor, waited
on by a rather odd woman—

(then stopping abruptly

and looking

ceilingward)
An odd woman, yet. A personality
trait she would be particularly
knowledgeable about! Well, anyway,
this woman who allegedly waited on
her-

SLOAN
(rising, tiredly)
Never mind, Armbruster, I'll talk to
her.

ARMBRUSTER
(<opening the door
for him)
She's right outside, sir.

42. Track shot with him As they walk through to anteroom and
out into the store.

43. Group shot As they approach Marsha, standing there

waiting.

ARMBRUSTER (CONT'D)
Miss White, this is our manager, Mr.
Sloan.

(CONTINUED)

ll.

SLOAN
(smiles perfunctorily)
Perhaps I can help you, Miss White?

MARSHA
Perhaps you can. The thimble is dented
and scratched-

SLOAN
((takes it from her,
examines it)
It most assuredly is. Now if you'll
take it back to the Gift department—

MARSHA
((shaking her head
from side to side)
Mr. Sloan, I've already explained to
Mr. Armbruster here, I did not
purchase this in the Gift department.
I was taken up to the ninth floor.

44. Close shot Armbruster As he gives Sloan a "see what I‘m
up against" kind of look.

45. Group shot

SLOAN
That‘s what so difficult to
understand, Miss White. You see, we
don't have a ninth floor.

46. Close shot Marsha

MARSHA
((firmly)
I was taken up to the ninth floor. I
was waited on by a very odd woman. I
paid cash.

ARMBRUSTER
Your receipt?

MARSHA

My recei—

(she bites her lip,

quietly)
I didn't get a receipt, but I paid
cash. I gave the woman a twenty—dollar
bill and a five—dollar bill.

(pointing to a package

now in Sloan's hand}
I was given that thimble and I—

She stops abruptly, her eyes going wide. CAMERA SWEEPS right
toward the object of Marsha's look.

(CONTINUED)

12.

47. Med. close shot The back of a saleslady's head, the hair
tied back in a bun just as before.

48. Flash shot Marsha

MARSHA (CONT'D)
There she is. It's the woman who
waited on me.
(calling loudly)
Miss! Miss, I wonder if you'd-

49-51. Series of close shots Sloan, Armbruster, and then
Marsha As they look and react. SLOW PAN OVER to the back of
the woman as she is suddenly lifted into the arms of a window
dresser who turns with her and starts toward the camera. The
woman is a mannequin. The face is a perfect replica of the
woman we've seen, but is nonetheless a mannequin.

52. Track shot As the window dresser carries her past Marsha
and the others t then ZOOMS into a close shot of Marsha as
her mouth half opens as if to scream.

53. Mbving close shot mannequin As it is carried toward the
window, the face wooden, immobile with a painted smile

FADE TO BLACK—END ACT ONE-ACT TWO-FADE ON:
54. INT. DEPARTMENT STORE GROUND FLOOR DAY (EARLY EVENING)
MED. CLOSE SHOT THE FACE OF THE MANNEQUIN

Who was the saleslady. It's been set up in a ladies wear
section which is directly across from the ladies lounge. PAN
SHOT from the face over to the door of the lounge. Mr.
Armbruster paces fretfully back and forth in front of the
door. A young salesgirl comes out.

ARMBRUSTER
Well, well, well? How is she?

SALESGIRL
She'll be all right, Mr. Armbruster.
She was just frightened, that's all.

ARMBRUSTER
((with a surreptitious
look left and right,
inches closer to the
girl, almost sotto)
What about this...this delusion of
hers?

SALESGIRL
I don't know. I didn't talk to her,
but she's resting now. I think she
may have gone to sleep.

(CONTINUED)

13.

A gong rings and Armbruster looks up toward a large clock on
the wall.

55. Close shot clock It reads six o'clock.

56. Two shot Armbruster takes out a pocket watch and checks

it.

ARMBRUSTER

Well, tell her we're closing now.
And tell her to come back tomorrow
and we'll get a replacement on her
merchandise...or a refund...or
anything she wants.

(then wiggling a finger

to someone across

the room)
All right, Miss Pettigrew!

(he claps his hands

together)
Closing up time.

(another look at the

salesgirl)
What I'd like to give her is a bus
ticket, a one way bus ticket to any
department store west of Cleveland,
preferably Chicago, Los Angeles or

Honolulu!
{then he moves away,
calls out)

Miss Pettigrew, did you hear me?
Closing time.

The salesgirl turns and starts toward the door, to the ladies
lounge, has her hand on the knob ready to open it.

VOICE (Off)
Miss Keevers, you have a customer.
Hurry please.

The salesgirl once again puts her hand on the knob, then

looks up at the clock, then turns away from the door and
moves off left.

SALESGIRL
I'm coming.

The CAMERA PANS UP to the clock.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

57. Close shot clock It reads 6:35. The lights have been
turned off in the store and only a few night lights remain.
PAN DOWN for MED. CLOSE SHOT, the door.

CUT TO:

14.
58. INT. LOUNGE

Marsha lies on a couch sound asleep. She wakens abruptly,
blinks her eyes, then bolts upright. A small night light is
on, providing the only illumination in the room. It outlines
the door.

59. Mbving shot with her As she jumps up and runs toward the
door, opening it wide.

60. Reverse angle looking toward her from the store As she
stands in the doorway and is gradually aware that she's left
alone in the store.

61. Mbving shot with her As she walks down the center aisle
leading toward the front door. She stops abruptly at the
sound of gongs which are immediately intruded upon by the
chimes of a clock. She reaches the front doors, yanks on
them, then knocks, then calls out to no one in particular.

MARSHA
Please...someone? I'm locked in here!
(she pounds on the
door again)
Anyone? Could I have some help please?

She waits a moment in silence, then turns and studies the
room, looking for another exit.

62. Track shot with her As she walks back down the aisle
slowly looking down at her feet.

63. CLOSE SHOT HER FEET

They send out a sharp click, click, click of high heels on
wood. Then they stop. PAN UP TO HER FACE as her eyes move
left and right, listening intently. She starts to walk again.

64. Extremely tight close shot her feet As they continue to
click, click, click along the floor and once again they stop.

65. Different angle Marsha As she stands stock still and
then very, very slowly turns to stare at something behind
her.

66. Reverse angle looking toward mannequin It remains in its
position, one hand on hip, the other spread out in typical
model form. Around the wrist of the extended arm is a small
handbag.

67. Extremely tight close shot Marsha As her eyes go wide.

68. Extremely tight close shot handbag Very slowly, almost
imperceptibly, it seems to swing back and forth.

(CONTINUED)

15.

69. Different angle Marsha As she whirls around and runs
down the aisle, continually looking over her shoulder to see
if she's being pursued.

70. Different angle of her As she runs.
71. Pan shot up to sign Which reads: Men's Department
CUT TO:

72. Med. long shot of her As she races toward the camera,
veering slowly to the left as she gets closer.

CUT TO:

73. Different angle As a figure of a man seems to loom onto
the screen from the right. Marsha hits it head on, knocking
him over.

74. Flash shot mannequin As it lands stiffly on the ground,
hitting the back of its head.

75. Extremely tight close shot Marsha Reacting.

76. Extremely tight close shot mannequin This is the face of
the young elevator operator who took her up to the ninth
floor.

77. Different close angle Marsha As her hands go to the sides
of her head and involuntarily she shakes her head back and
forth as if rejecting everything she's looking at.

78. Close shot her feet As once again she runs in the opposite
direction, then the feet suddenly stop.

79. Angle shot looking up at her face As like some frightened
child, her head jerks to various different positions of
listening and watching. From someplace far off, unintelligible
is the sound of a giant whisper.

VOICE (Off)
Marsha...

80. Tight close shot As she turns in that direction.

VOICE (CONT'D)
(Off, from opposite
side)
Marsha...

81. Close shot Marsha She whirls around toward this direction.

fooling, Marsha? Come on,
dear...climb off it. You remember,
Marsha? You know who you are.

89. Angle shot looking down at Marsha

As she backs away from the voices of the mannequins.

90. Close shot As she backs into the saleswoman mannequin.
91. ANGLE SHOT LOOKING UP TOWARD MANNEQUIN MARSHA'S P.O.V.

92. Reverse angle looking down on Marsha‘s horrified face
She continues to back away.

CUT TO:

93. Shot through glass phone booth Of Marsha as she backs
into it, lets out a little gasp, turns, sees the phone, enters
the booth, picks up the receiver.

94. Close shot coin slots

95. Extremely tight close shot Marsha As her eyes close. She
suddenly realizes she has no coins. Wildly, illogically, she
jiggles the hook up and down. Over her shoulder we see the
saleswoman mannequin in the same place.

96. Different angle Marsha Very close to the phone as she
replaces the receiver. She looks up slowly and her eyes go
wide again.

97. Angle shot over her shoulder The spot where the saleswoman
mannequin was in no longer occupied.

98. Zoom through the glass of the phone booth To where the
mannequin was.

(CONTINUED)

17.

99. REVERSE ANGLE MRRSEA

As she pushes the phone booth door open and rushes out, pushed
and prodded by a directionless fear. She winds up alongside
the elevator doors and almost concurrent with her arrival
there, the doors of one elevator slide open. Without thinking,
she runs inside.

100. INT. ELEVATOR

Marsha has moved to the opposite side of the elevator and
stands in the corner, her face buried against the wall, eyes
closed tightly.

101. Extremely tight close shot side of her face Her hand
covering her eye. Suddenly she hears the sound of the door
behind her slide shut and the low, steady hum of the elevator
as it ascends. Very slowly she turns as if expecting to see
someone operating it.

102. Reverse angle looking toward the button panel Alongside
the door where the operator usually stands. No one is
operating the elevator.

103. Extremely tight close shot the panel As the light flashes
at each floor. Six, seven, eight, and on up.

104. Extremely tight close shot Marsha As she stares at the
board intently.

105. Extremely tight close shot the board The lights go past
eight and on up to nine, then stop.

106. Reverse angle looking toward Marsha As she slowly looks
up, her face white, tense.

107. Reverse angle the doors As they very slowly slide open.
The floor beyond the open door is a vast dark emptiness.
Marsha steps into the frame from behind the camera and out
of the elevator. Almost immediately lights go on and she's
looking into a semicircle of faces of men and women, each
dressed in specialized fashion, sportswear, skiing, bathing,
etc. In the front stands the saleswoman, now as flesh and
blood as we first saw her. They look at Marsha with a kind
of collective pitying smile, not unfriendly or menacing, but
hardly a welcome smile either.

WOMAN
Well, Marsha dear, you'll forgive an
observation...but you're acting like
a silly child.

108. C1ose shot Marsha Her eyes dart around, looking at each
of the faces.

MERSEA
What...what are you...why am I...?

(CONTINUED)

109. Reverse angle looking toward saleswoman

WOMAN
Come now, Marsha, think now.
Concentrate.
(a pause)
Remember now? All of us will try and
help you. We'll help you concentrate.

110. Pan shot past the faces of the people Each nods. The
PAN ENDS ON MARSHA as she shakes her head from side to side
and on the last motion stops abruptly. Her eyes go up, then
look away.

111. GROUP SHOT

WOMEN (CONT'D)
Remember now? Coming back to you?

The people behind her nod encouragement.

112. Med. close shot Mhrsha As she slowly nods along with
them.

MARSHA
Why...that's odd. That's really odd.
But suddenly I do seem to-

WOMmN
((filling it in for
her)
Remember? Coming back now, is it?

114. Close shot Marsha This information is said more to
herself.

MARSHA
Why, I'm...I'm a mannequin.That's
what I am. I'm a mannequin. And it
was my turn to—

115. Close shot the woman Smiling very contentedly now.

WOMAN

Your turn to leave us for a month.
Becoming much clearer now, isn‘t it?
You left us for a month and lived
with the outsiders. But you were due
back yesterday and you didn't show
up.

(gently reproving now)
And you know, Marsha, that's selfish,
my dear. All of us wait our turn and
we simply do not over-stay it. It
was my turn starting last night. I‘m
one day delayed already.

(CONTINUED)

19.

MERSEA
((softly)
Of course. Of course, I'm sorry. I
forgot. When you're on the outside
everything seems so...so normal, as
if—

ELEVATOR OPERATOR
As if what, Marsha?

116. Close shot Marsha

MARSHA
As if we were...like the others.
Like the outsiders.
(a pause)
Like the real people.

117. Group shot The woman steps forward and puts an arm around
Marsha.

WOMAN

Well, my dear...no serious harm done.

(she pats her arm

gently and crosses

in front of her over

to the elevator door)
I'll see you all in a month. Take
care of yourselves.

CHORUS OF VOICES
Have a nice time. Enjoy yourself.
See you in a month.

118. Méd. long shot elevator doors As they open. The woman
smiles and waves and walks inside. Then the elevator doors
Close and we hear the hum as it descends. CAMERA DOLLIES
BACK in for a MED. CLOSE SHOT MARSHA as she stares toward
the elevator.

ELEVATOR OPERATOR
Enjoy it, Marsha? Was it fun?

MARSHA
((nods slowly, in
almost a whisper)
Ever so much fun.
(a pause, then her
eyes go down)
Ever so much fun!

119. Pan shot over and up to the floor indicator Over the
elevator doors as the arrow reaches g.

20.

120. The same indicator PULL BACK for LONG ANGLE SHOT of the
department store's first floor and the hustle and bustle of
mid—morning. We see Mr. Armbruster walking up and dOwn the
aisles, snapping fingers, giving orders, finding faults.

121. Different angle eye level Down one aisle as he walks
toward the camera. The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he walks toward
it until just a part of a female mannequin from the back can
be seen on one side of the screen.

122. Close: moving shot Armbruster As he walks full face
into camera, stops, looks thoughtful for a moment, then turns
to look behind him.

123. Close shot Marsha's face in mannequin form She is in
the place formerly occupied by the saleswoman mannequin,
dressed identically, with her hair in the same bun.

124. FULL SHOT THE AREA

As Armbruster turns back to face the camera. Still the little
quizzical, thoughtful look, then he shrugs and makes a face
and continues to walk down the aisle. The CAMERA STARTS A
LOW PULL UP from the shot until we're looking down on Marsha
as a focal point in the room.

NARRAIOR'S VOICE

Marsha White, in her normal and
natural state. A wooden lady with a
painted face, who, one month out of
the year, takes on the characteristics
of someone as normal and as flesh
and blood as you and I.

(a pause)
But it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Just how normal are we? Just who
are the people we nod our hellos to
as we pass on the street. A rather
good question to ask...particularly
in The Twilight Zone!

FADE TO BLACK.
