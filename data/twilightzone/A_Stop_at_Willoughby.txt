1. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM [DAY]

This is a big, sumptuous, paneled room with a long, low slung
table in the center surrounded by ad agency execs.

2. HIGH ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN

At the men around the table. SLOW PAN DOWN until we're
looking across and down the table at eye level of the men
around it.

3. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING TOWARD THE HEAD OF TABLE

At Misrell, the president of the ad agency, a fat and
overpowering man of giant stature with small piggish eyes, a
perpetually angry and dour face, a challenging look that
never leaves. PAN DOWN THE TABLE at the faces of the men
sitting there quietly and finally winding up on Gart
Williams, a tall, attractive man in a Brooks Brothers suit
who drums on the table nervously, checks an expensive looking
watch, then rises.

4. TRACK SHOT OVER WITH HIM

To a telephone which he picks up, seems to cup in his hand to
keep the others from overhearing his conversation. He's
obviously distraught beyond any kind of description now. His
face looks pinched and strained. He talks quietly into the
phone.

WILLIAMS
I want Jake Ross's secretary!
(he waits impatiently, conscious of
Misrell staring at him)

MISRELL'S VOICE
(from opposite side of room)
Williams, we're still waiting for your
Mr. Ross!

WILLIAMS
(with a forced smile, over his
shoulder) )
I'm trying to get him now, sir.
(then into phone)
This Jake Ross's secretary? Joanie: Where
is he? I know he's out to lunch. But
there was a conference called here at two
o'clock. It is now two—thirty, now where
is he!
(he wets his lips, forces his
voice down an octave)
All right, check around.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS (cont'd)
Call Sardi's East or the Colony and tell
him to get his keister back here in a
hurry!

He slams down the receiver then fixes his face into a
smiling, nonchalant mask and returns to the table.

5. TRACK SHOT WITH HIM

As he walks over to the table, sits down, again smiling
toward Mr. Misrell.

6. CLOSE SHOT MISRELL
Who stares back at him, totally unsmiling.

MISRELL
Well? Where is your protege with the
three-million—dollar automobile account?

WILLIAMS
He‘s due at any moment, sir. Probably a
big lunch crowd or something—

MISRELL
Don't be an idiot. More likely a big
martini, or three or four of 'em. He was
too young to put on this account — I told
you that, Williams. He's much too young
to put on this large and important an
account-

There's a knock on the door.

7. MOVING SHOT WITH WILLIAMS

As he springs to his feet and hurries over to the big, double
conference room doors. He opens it up. A young secretary
hands him an envelope which he literally pulls out of her
hand, slams the door behind him, rips open the envelope, and
starts to read.

8. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS‘ FACE

As suddenly he looks white, stares up over the letter briefly
toward Misrell.

9. CLOSE SHOT MISRELL

Reacting.

10. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As his eyes slowly go downward and the letter in his hand
drops to his side. He carries it very slowly over to the
table and stands there at the far end.

11. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER

Down the length of the table at Misrell who very slowly drums
on the table in a methodical, tapping that permeates the
silence of the room.

MISRELL
Well? We have now been here thirty-four
minutes, Mr. Williams.

WILLIAMS
(looks up from the letter,
takes a deep breath)
This is a communication from Jake Ross.

MISRELL
Would you be so kind as to share its
contents with us?

12. MED. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he looks down at the letter, spreads it out on the top of
the table, then looks up from it.

WILLIAMS
I can tell you the sense of it very
quickly, Mr. Misrell. This is Jake Ross's
resignation. He's moving over to another
agency.

13. CLOSE SHOT MISRELL
As his face seems to freeze.

MISRELL
And?

14. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS
As his face seems to freeze.
WILLIAMS

And he's taking the automobile account
with him.

15. PAN SHOT DOWN THE FACES OF THE MEN

At the table as each seems to catch his breath and then look
from Misrell and with great compassion and concern over
toward Williams.

MISRELL
Did you hear what I said, Williams? That
account represented a gross billing of
something in the neighborhood of three
million dollars a year. And how many
times have you promised it to me?

WILLIAMS
(clears his throat and for a
moment can't get a word out)
This is as much of a shock to me as it is
to you, Mr. Misrell.

MISRELL
(roaring)
Don't con me, Williams! It was your pet
project! Your pet project: Then it was
your idea to give it to that little
college greeny! Now get with it,
Williams. Get with it, boy!

He rises from his seat and goes to the window, his jowled,
fleshy face screwed up like a little baby about to cry; now
he whirls around toward Williams, points a finger at him.

MISRELL (cont ' d)
So what's left, Williams? Not only has
your pet project backfired but it's
sprouted wings and left the premises!
I'll tell you what's left to us in my
view! A deep and abiding concern about
your judgment in men!

16. PAN SHOT DOWN THE FACES OF THE MEN

Each of whom look down at their hands in a vast, biting
embarrassment.

17. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he closes his eyes for a moment, feels the sweat on his
forehead and then unconsciously massages his stomach as an
ulcer deep inside lights a match to his insides.

18. CLOSE SHOT MISRELL

As he returns to the table, pounds the flats of his hands
down on it.

MISRELL
This is a push business, Williams! A
push, push, push business. Push and
drive, but personally. You don't delegate
responsibilities to little boys.

19. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he looks sick.

MISRELL'S VOICE
You should know it more than anyone else.

The CAMERA DOLLIES in for an EXTREMELY TIGHT, TIGHT CLOSE
SHOT of MISRELL'S FACE shooting at just the NOSE and LITTLE
OVAL MOUTH that goes up and down and up and down.
MISRELL

A push, push, push business, Williams.

It's push, push, push all the way. All

the time. Right on down the line—
20. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS
As suddenly he can't stand it any longer and shouts out.

WILLIAMS
Fat boy, why don't you shut your mouth!

21.—25. SERIES OF ABRUPT CUTS FROM FACE TO FACE

Of the men at the table, then Misrell, then Williams who
suddenly exhales and realizes that the voice that suddenly
exploded in the room like shrapnel was his own!

25A. INSERT COFFEE CUP

Drops to floor.

26. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he closes his eyes for a moment, grabs at his stomach very
tightly as once again the ulcer makes an assault on him, then

he turns and walks quietly out of the room.

CUT TO:

27. EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM A LINE OF DESKS

TWO SECRETARIES WHISPER TO ONE ANOTHER AS HE GOES PAST THEM.
28. TRACK SHOT WILLIAMS

AS HE CONTINUES TO WALK THROUGH THE OFFICE.

CUT TO:

29. INT. DIFFERENT OFFICE AREA

Williams's secretary, Helen, sits at a desk and looks up as
Williams approaches. She forces a smile.

HELEN
Messages on the desk, boss. And hot
coffee out here. Can I bring you some?

He shakes his head and starts toward the door.

HELEN
Want anything at all?

He turns from the door and stares at her.

WILLIAMS
Yeah. A sharp razor and a chart of the
human anatomy showing where all the
arteries are!

He goes into the office and slams the door behind him.
30. INT. WILLIAMS'S OFFICE

Fluorescent tube lighting is on all around the room and the
first thing he does is flick off the switch putting the room
into a semi—darkness. Then he walks over to a big, modern,
expensive—looking desk, looks briefly at the picture of a
beautiful woman on it, then sits down behind the desk and
stares down at nothing. Over this tableau we hear the
Narrator's voice.

NARRATOR’S VOICE
This is Gart Williams, age thirty—eight,
a man protected by a suit of armor all
held together by one bolt. Just a moment
ago, someone removed the bolt and Mr.
Williams‘s protection fell away from him
and left him a naked target. He's been
cannonaded this afternoon by all the
enemies of his life. His insecurity has
shelled him;

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

NARRATOR'S VOICE (cont'd)
his sensitivity has straddled him with
humiliation; his deep-rooted disquiet
about his own worth has zeroed in on him,
landed on target, and blown him apart.
Mr. Gart Williams, ad agency exec, who in
just a moment will move into the Twilight
Zone in a desperate search for survival!

FADE TO BLACK
OPENING BILLBOARD
FIRST COMMERCIAL
FADE ON:

31. INT. COMMUTER TRAIN [NIGHT] LONG SHOT DOWN LENGTH OF ONE
OF CARS

A conductor comes into the frame from behind the camera
collecting the tickets of the few passengers who remain.
DOLLY IN with him toward Williams who sits by himself at the
far end of the car. Conductor takes his ticket, punches it.

32. TWO SHOT THE TWO MEN

CONDUCTOR ONE
How are you tonight, Mr. Williams?

WILLIAMS
(looks up, tiredly, with a wry
grin)
In the absolute pink!

He turns and looks out toward the wintry, dark landscape.

CONDUCTOR ONE
Cold winter this year. Seems to get
darker earlier than it ever has.

WILLIAMS
(nods)
That's the way of the world. The rich get
richer and the days get shorter!

The conductor chuckles, sticks the ticket into the slot in
the back of the seat facing Williams, then continues out of
the car.

33. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he leans back in the chair. His face looks tired and wan.
He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

In his subconscious he heard the voice first of Misrell and
then other voices that spring up from his subconscious. Over
the tight, close shot of his face the voices come in
filtered, discordantly loud, real and yet somehow a step
beyond reality.

MISRELL'S VOICE
It's a push, push, push business,
Williams. It's an absolutely push, push,
push business. It's a push, push, push
business. You got to get with it, boy.
It's a push, push, push business. You got
to get with it, boy. It's a push, push,
push business. You got to get with it,
boy.

34. DIFFERENT TIGHT ANGLE WILLIAMS'S FACE
As his eyes go open and he shouts out.

WILLIAMS
That's enough!

35. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT WOMAN IN FRONT
OF HIM

Who turns around, wide—eyed, and stares at him.
36. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he turns away from her to stare out the window of the
train.

37. ANGLE SHOT OVER HIS SHOULDER

At the wintry landscape outside in the darkness. His eyes
close as he leans his head out the window and after a moment
lets his head rest on the back of the seat, his eyes closed.
The sound of the train comes up to provide a humming clickety
clack sound as the CAMERA MOVES IN for an angle shot looking
down from over the head of Williams as he falls asleep.
Gradually the sound of the train takes on a different tone.
It‘s imperceptible at first and then very obvious, almost as
if the train were going through a tunnel and there was an
echoy effect. Lights shoot by playing on Williams's face and
on the interior of the train. The CAMERA STARTS A SLOW PAN
DOWN until it's directly in front of Williams, shooting on
him. Then the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an absolutely empty
car and suddenly the entire car is suffused by sunlight and
then the train is suddenly coming to a Stop. DOLLY IN FOR
CLOSE SHOT OF WILLIAMS as his eyes open and suddenly blink.
He takes a deep breath, looks at his watch, then looks out
the window.

38. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS'S FACE

As he suddenly starts in amazement. SLOW PAN SHOT up from him
to a SHOT OUT THE WINDOW. Outside it is suddenly bright and
sunny and obviously summer. The train has stopped in front of
a small railroad station with a big sign which reads

"Willoughby."

39. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

AS AGAIN HE STARTS AND STARES.

40. LONG SHOT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW

Of the train station. There are horse-drawn carriages. Women
with parasols and long dresses. Men in obvious nineteenth—
century costume. Little boys with knickers run back and
forth. One carries a fishing pole.

41. DIFFERENT ANGLE LOOKING DOWN THE STREET

As seen from the train car. A bandstand, carriages, all the
accoutrements to a quiet summer day of almost a century ago.

42. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As his eyes scan the scene. He shakes his head in
bewilderment, amazement.

43. DIFFERENT ANGLE OF HIM INSIDE TRAIN

As he rises, walks halfway down the car, staring out of the
windows as he walks.

44. LONG SHOT OVER HIS SHOULDER

As the far door of the car opens. A conductor comes in, this
one in old—fashioned dress. He smiles at Williams and calls
out in a trainman's voice.

CONDUCTOR.TWO
Willoughby. This stop is Willoughbyl

He starts to walk past Williams who grabs him.

WILLIAMS
What do you mean, Willoughby? Where's
Willoughby?

CONDUCTOR TWO
(grins and winks)
Willoughby? That's Willoughby right
outside.

(CONTINUED)

10.
CONTINUED:

Williams whirls around to stare out the window again, then
turns toward the conductor.

WILLIAMS
Wait a minute...wait a minute, what's
going on? There‘s no place called
Willoughby on this line. And look at it
outside. The sun is out. It's...it‘s
summer.

CONDUCTOR TWO
(smiles)
That's what she is, mid-Julyl And a real
warm one, too.

He starts to walk past and again Williams has to grab him and
stop him.

WILLIAMS
Wait a minute...it's November. What's
going on anyway? It's November! What is
this place? Where are we? What‘s
happened?

45. DIFFERENT ANGLE THE CONDUCTOR

As he releases himself and continues to walk down the car.
46. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER

Toward Williams who stands there staring after him.

47. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING TOWARD CONFUCTOR WILLIAMS'S P.O.V.

WILLIAMS
Please...please, what's going on? Where
is Willoughby?

48. MED. CLOSE SHOT THE CONDUCTOR

As he smiles again but this time with a touch of seriousness
on his face and a kind of mysterious tilt of his head. He
winks.

CONDUCTOR TWO
Willoughby, sir? That's Willoughby right
outside. Willoughby. July. Summer. It's
1888. It‘s a lovely little village.
(and then the smile fades and
there's something intense in
his voice)
You ought to try it sometime!
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED:

CONDUCTOR TWO (cont'd)
Peaceful, restful, where a man can slow
down to a walk and live his life full

measure!
(then he turns and calls out

again)
Willoughy. This stop is Willoughby.

He continues out the opposite door.

49. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he races down the length of the car to follow the
conductor. He yanks open the door.

CUT TO:

50. SHOT OVER HIS SHOULDER OF THE PLATFORM BETWEEN CARS

Which is empty, and beyond it a window leading to the next
car which is also empty of anyone.

51. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he turns around and is tight on camera. His face is
twisted and torn with confusion. His mouth opens as if to
protest or question or plead for someone to give him
understanding and clarity. Suddenly the train lurches and he
falls against the side of the door, clutching it for support.
Then very slowly he turns and walks back to his seat.

52. TRACK SHOT WITH HIM AS HE WALKS
And sits down. He looks out of the window.
53. MOVING SHOT FROM INSIDE THE TRAIN

As the train moves and leaves the town and station behind.
The CAMERA DOLLIES IN FOR EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF
WILLIAMS as he stares out the window and then suddenly the
light pattern changes. The interior lights of the train take
over and it is now dark and wintry and there are other people
in the car. The conductor that we've seen in the beginning
comes by.

CONDUCTOR ONE
Westport-Saugatuck next stop.
(he pauses by Williams)
Have a good sleep, Mr. Williams?

WILLIAMS
(starts and looks up at him)
Yeah.
(after a pause, quietly)
Yeah, I had a good sleep.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS (cont ' d)
A good sleep with an idiotic dream.
Idiotic.
(he turns to stare out the
window)
At least...at least I guess it's idiotic.
(then he turns to look up
toward conductor)
Ever hear of a town named Willoughby?

CONDUCTOR ONE
(screws up his face
thoughtfully)
Willoughby? Willoughby where?

WILLIAMS
Willoughby, Connecticut, I guess. Or
Willoughby, New York.

CONDUCTOR ONE
(shakes his head thoughtfully)
No, not on this run.
(he moves)

There's no Willoughby on the line.
(then he continues on, yelling)
Westport-Saugatuck next stop. Westport-

Saugatuck.

He disappears through the car door as the CAMERA PANS OVER to
Williams. He rises very slowly to his feet, picks up his
briefcase, starts out the car as weDDDISSOLVE TO:

54. EXT. SUBURBAN RANCH HOME [NIGHT] SPRAWLING VERY
PRETENTIOUS LOOKING MODERN HOME

DISSOLVE TO:
55. INT. LIVING ROOM—DEN

Williams stands by a small bar pouring himself a large
highball. He stirs the ice and very reflectively takes a sip
of it. He turns as the light from the hall outside is
suddenly ushered into the room with the door opening.

56. MED. CLOSE SHOT MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR

Framed there is the reflection of Williams's wife, Jane. She

stands there frozen in place in the doorway looking across at
him, accusing. This is a beautiful woman. But beautiful like

alabaster — just as cold, just as brittle, just as lacking in
emotion. She walks slowly across the room toward him.

13.

57. DIFFERENT ANGLE THE TWO OF THEM

JANE
And what are your plans this evening? To
get quietly plastered and then sing old
college songs?

WILLIAMS
(smiles at her a little wanly)
It's been one of those days—

JANE
I know all about it. Bob Blair's wife
called me. She said he'd been in the
meeting with you. You got...you got
hysterical or something. she called to
find out how you were.

58. MED. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS
As he turns away, smiles.

WILLIAMS

They were all very solicitous — all the
boys at the meeting.

(he looks down into his glass

and jiggles the ice)
That free-flowing compassion that is
actually relief! I'm the victim - not
them! They've mistaken an intake of
breath for an outpouring of sympathy!

He starts to pour himself another drink. She crosses over and
grabs his arm, looking straight into his face, her own face
white and taut.

JANE
Would you spare me your little homilies
now and just give me a little simple and
frank and honest answer. Did you wreck a
career this afternoon? Did you throw away
a job?

WILLIAMS
It appears not. Mr. Misrell phoned before
I left the office. He has found it in
that giant, oversized heart of his to
forgive. This somewhat obese, gracious
gentleman will allow me to continue in
his employ simply because he's such a
human—type fellah-

(a pause)
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS (cont'd)
With a small, insignificant, parenthetic
additional reason — that if I were to go
to competitive agency, I might possibly
take a lot of business with me!

JANE
G0 on.

WILLIAMS

(shrugs)
That's it. That's all of it.

(he carries his drink across

the room and sits down in a

chair)
I'm tired, Janie. I'm tired, and I’m
sick.

JANE

(from across the room)
Then you're in the right ward! We
specialize in people who are sick and
tired too, Gart. I'm sick and tired of a
husband who lives in a kind of permanent
self-pity! A husband with a heart
bleeding sensitivity he unfurls like a
flag whenever he decides that the
competition is too rough for him.

59. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As his head goes up and he stares across the room at her.

WILLIAMS

Some people aren‘t built for competition,
Janie.

(he rises and walks halfway

over to her)
Or big pretentious houses that they can't
afford. Or rich communities they don't
feel comfortable in. Or country clubs
that they wear around their necks like a
badge of status—

JANE
(on her feet, shouts at him)
And you would prefer-

WILLIAMS
(outshouting her now)
I would prefer, though never asked
before, a job, any job — any job at all
where I could be myself!
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS (cont‘d)

Where I wouldn't have to climb on a stage
and go through a masquerade every morning
at nine and mouth all the dialogue and
play the executive and make believe I‘m
the bright young man on his way up.
Because I'm not that person, Janie.
You've tried to make me that person, but
that isn't me.

(now his voice is quieter as he

turns away from her)
That isn't me at all. I‘m...I'm a not
very young, soon to be old, very
uncompetitive, rather dull, quite
uninspired, average type of guy—

(he whirls around toward her)
With a wife who has an appetite!

JANE
And where would you be if it weren't for
my appetite?

60. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS
As his eyes drop. He walks over to the chair and sits down.

WILLIAMS
I know where I'd like to be.

JANE
(challenging, her voice brittle
and shrill)
And where would that be?

He looks up at her. The CAMERA MOVES IN VERY CLOSE TO HIS
FACE.

WILLIAMS
A place called Willoughby. A little town
that I chartered inside my head. A place
I manufactured in a dream.
(he looks away from her now,
speaks softly and
reflectively, almost as if to
himself)
An odd dream. A very odd dream.
Willoughby. It was summer. Very warm. The
kids were barefooted. One of them carried
a fishing pole. And the main street
looked like...looked like a Currier and
Ives painting. Bandstand, old-fashioned
stores, bicycles, wagons.
(he looks toward her again)
I've never seen such a...such a serenity.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

16.
CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS (cont'd)
It was the way people must have lived a
hundred years ago.
(a pause as he looks away
again)
Crazy dream.

61. MOVING SHOT JANE
As she walks over to him.
62. ANGLE SHOT LOOKING UP AT HER

Her face is distorted with an impatience, a frustration, a
deep-rooted and abiding lack of respect for the man, in
addition to the sense of impotence on her part. She turns and
starts out of the room.

63. DIFFERENT ANGLE THE ROOM
As Williams rises.

WILLIAMS
Janie-

She stops at the door, her back to him.
64. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER

Toward him. His voice is soft and with a strange quality of
hunger and yearning.

WILLIAMS

You should have seen this
place...this...this Willoughby. Janie, it
wasn't just a place...or a time...

(a pause)
It was like...a doorway that leads to
sanity. A soundproof world where shouts
and cries can‘t be heard.

65. CLOSE SHOT JANE

JANE
(her words like pieces of ice)

Nothing serious, Gart. It's just that you
were born too late. That's the problem.
You were born too late. And your taste is
a little cheap! You're the kind of man
who could be satisfied with a summer
afternoon and an ice wagon pulled by a
horse. My mistake, pal. My error. My
miserable tragic error.

17.
CONTINUED:

JANE (cont'd)
To get married to a man whose big dream
in life is to be Huckleberry Finn: That
is what you want, isn't it?

66. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

WILLIAMS

Something like that. A place...a
time...where a man can live his life full
measure.

(he turns away thoughtfully,

softly)
That's what he said. That's what
that...that conductor said. A place where
a man can live his life full measure!

DISSOLVE TO:
67. INT. TRAIN [NIGHT] CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

Sitting in his customary seat. Over his shoulder we see the
landscape outside cloaked by wintry night, occasional lights
flashing by. He stirs when he hears the conductor‘s voice.

CONDUCTOR ONE'S VOICE
Willoughby?

CAMERA PULLS BACK FOR TWO SHOT

WILLIAMS
What?

CONDUCTOR ONE

Last week you asked me about a town
called Willoughby, Mr. Williams.

(he scratches his jaw)
I looked it up. Every old timetable I
could find.

(he shakes his head)
No such place as far as I could see.

WILLIAMS
(forcing a smile)
Thanks. It was a dream, that's all.

CONDUCTOR ONE
(continuing on down the car)
Probably was.
(calling out)
Next stop, Stamford. Stamford, next stop.

18.

68. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he puts his head back, sighs deeply, looks out the window
briefly and closes his eyes. In the background we hear the
conductor's voice once again calling out.

CONDUCTOR ONE‘S VOICE
Stamford next stop. Stamford.

69. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS'S FACE [DAY]

As once again the conductor's voice segues into that of the
other conductor and gradually gets louder.

CONDUCTOR TWO'S VOICE
Willoughby. Next stop, Willoughby.

Once again Williams's eyes open wide. He springs to his feet
and stares out the window. Once again the car is of an old—

fashioned variety and empty save for the conductor who
approaches him walking down the aisle.

CONDUCTOR TWO
Willoughby, sir.

70. DIFFERENT ANGLE

WILLIAMS
Willoughby?

He turns to stare out the window again.

71. LONG SHOT OVER HIS SHOULDER OF RAILROAD STATION AND TOWN
BEYOND

This time a band plays in the bandstand at the far end of the
street and there's the sound of laughter, horses, an organ
grinder - all of them fusing together to provide a kind of
soft symphony.

72. MOVING SHOT WILLIAMS
As he goes out of the car to the train platform.
73. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING UP AT HIM

From outside as he stops there. The conductor passes behind
him heading for the next car.

CONDUCTOR TWO
Willoughby. All out for Willoughby.

19.

74. ZOOMAR INTO WILLIAMS'S FACE

As he stands there transfixed, obviously on a thin line now
between disbelief and resolve. He makes a motion as if to get
off the train, then stops, looks down to the ground, then
he‘s thrown off balance by the sudden jerk of the train
starting.

75. MOVING SHOT THE TRAIN

With Williams standing on the platform. The moment of
decision has passed and he has obviously retreated.

76. DIFFERENT ANGLE THE TRAIN PLATFORM

As Williams turns away, stands there for a moment as the
train picks up speed, slowly raises his head to look into the
train car from which he's come.

77. LONG SHOT HIS P.O.V. [NIGHT]

Once again it is filled with people and is no longer old-
fashioned.

78. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he whirls around to stare out from the platform to the
outside.

79. SHOT OVER HIS SHOULDER
Of the landscape going by. Once again it is wintry and dark.
80. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he closes his eyes, swallows and is beset not only by
bewilderment, but by an odd, haunting sense of having lost
another chance.

81. MOVING SHOT WITH HIM

As he goes into the car and to his seat. He looks out at the
passing landscape and then at the reflection of himself in
the glass. His lips move and after a moment we can hear what
he's saying.

WILLIAMS
(softly, to himself) )
Willoughby. Next time...next time...I'm
going to get off!
(he turns to face the camera,
his face determined and grim)
I‘m going to get off at Willoughby!

20.

FADE TO BLACK
ACT TWO
FADE ON:

82. INT. WILLIAMS'S OFFICE [DAY] EXTREMELY TIGHT ANGLE SHOT
OF A TELEPHONE RECEIVER

In front of Williams's face. We hear the filtered but
strident voice of Misrell.

MISRELL
What we need here, Williams, is a show
with zazz! An entertainer with moxie!
We've got to take the audience by the
ears and give 'em a yank! Jar 'em: Rock
'em! Give them the old push, push, push!

WILLIAMS
(closing his eyes) )
I understand, Mr. Misrell.

83. PAN SHOT DOWN WILLIAMS'S BODY

After first seeing his face convulse in sudden agonizing
pain. Now his right hand moves inside his shirt to touch his
stomach as the ulcer once again rakes over his inside.

MISRELL‘S VOICE
Now it's got to be bright, Williams.
Bright with patter. Dancing. Comedy. And
everything push, push, push, push. That‘s
the kind of show the client'll like.

84. MED. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

WILLIAMS
I understand, Mr. Misrell. I understand—

MISRELL'S VOICE
Tomorrow morning, Williams! Understand? I
want at least a preliminary idea for the
show. You know what I want — just a rough
format with some specifics as to how we
integrate the commercials within the body
of the show.

85. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

WILLIAMS
I'll do what I can.

21.

86. CLOSE SHOT PHONE RECEIVER

MISRELL'S VOICE
Do more than you can. With me, Williams?
Aspire! Dream big and then get behind it.
Push, push, push, push.

Williams moves the phone away from him during the speech so
that we are on the telephone listening to "push, push, push,

push."
87. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he lays down the receiver and once again his hand massages
his stomach. He looks pale and sick and inundated by pain.
The phone rings. He picks it up. We hear a filtered voice
blabbering at him. The words unintelligble, but the sense of
the urgency very much in evidence.

WILLIAMS
(trying to interject at odd
moments) )
Well, I haven‘t seen the ratings on the
show...no...no...well it was the time

slot the sponsor wanted—

Another phone rings.

WILLIAMS

(into the first phone) )

Hold on just a second, will you.
(he pushes a button and talks
into the other line)

Yes? They were what? Wait a second.
(he shouts out)

Helen?

88. LONG SHOT THE DOOR

As the secretary appears.

WILLIAMS
What film outfit did the commercials on
the Bradbury account? The negatives are
all scratched. They're screaming bloody
murder at me.

HELEN
I'll have to Check it, sir. Mr. Misrell
would like to see you.

The voice on the phone suddenly comes in loud and strident.

(CONTINUED)

22.
CONTINUED:

WILLIAMS
I'm going to have to check it out for you
here-

HELEN

Mr. Misrell , sir .
The voice continues on the line.

HELEN
Mr. Williams, Mr. Misrell seemed rather
insistent-

89. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As his face suddenly seems very pale. The voices continue to
probe at him.

90. MOVING SHOT WITH HIM

As he crosses the room almost like some kind of automaton,
walks into the small private bathroom adjoining the office,
stands in front of the mirror. The camera moves up for a shot
of the reflection of his office over his shoulder. The phones
on the desk jabber and ring, jabber and ring.

91. REVERSE ANGLE LOOKING TOWARD WILLIAMS'S FACE

As he stares at himself. All the time the phones and voices
seem to reach a crescendo and screech at him.

CUT TO:
92. SHOT OF MISRELL'S FACE IN THE MIRROR

The fleshy jowled features, the piggish eyes, the lips that
move up and down, up and down.

MISRELL
(in the mirror) )
Push, push, push, Williams. Push, push,
push, Williams. Push, push, push,
Williams.

93. PROFILE SHOT WILLIAMS

As his features contort and suddenly he takes the flats of
both hands and smashes the mirror, breaking it into a hundred
pieces. At this moment all noise stops and there is dead and
utter silencef

23.

94. MED. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS

As he turns to face the camera, his mouth twitching, his eyes
shut.

WILLIAMS
No more: No more — in God's name...no
more!

95. TRACK SHOT WILLIAMS

As he runs across the room, flicks off the lights, leans
against the wall for a moment. Then he turns and retraces his
steps back to the desk, picks up the phone, dials a number.

WILLIAMS

I'd like Westport, Connecticut, please.
Capital 7—9899. Yes, please.

(he waits for a moment)
Janie, this is Gart, honey. Stay there,
will you please? I just want you to stay
there. I'm coming home.

(a pause as he listens to her

obviously arguing)
Janie...Janie, please listen...

(then shouting)
Janie! I've had it. Understand? I've had
it. I can't go on for another day. I
can't go on for another hour. This is it
right now. I've got to get out of here.

(another pause)
Janie.

(close to tears)
Janie, help me, will you. Please...please
help me. Janie?

(a pause)
Janie?

He clicks the receiver then listens to what is obviously a
dead line. He slowly replaces the receiver and, massaging his
stomach, he stares at the telephone.

DISSOLVE TO:

96. INT. TRAIN [NIGHT] MED. CLOSE SHOT

Williams in his seat. The conductor passes him, punches his
ticket.

CONDUCTOR ONE

You‘re going home early tonight, huh, Mr.
Williams?

(CONTINUED)

24.
CONTINUED:

Williams nods and doesn't say anything. The conductor
continues on down the aisle, punching tickets. Williams moves
in his seat, stares out through the window, impatiently,
nervously checks his watch, then looks out the window again,
rises to peer more closely out of the glass, then sits down
again. His fingers twitch convulsively. He starts to take out
a cigarette then looks up at a sign over the door.

97. CLOSE SHOT THE SIGN
"No Smoking"
98. ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN FROM THE SIGN TOWARD WILLIAMS

Who starts to put the cigarettes away in his pocket then
drops them.

99. TOP HAT SHOT FROM ACROSS THE AISLE LOOKING STRAIGHT
TOWARD THE FLOOR BY WILLIAMS

As he bends down to pick up the cigarettes. The conductor's
voice is heard.

CONDUCTOR ONE'S VOICE
Stamford next stop. Stamford.

100. EXTREMELY TIGHT CLOSE SHOT CIGARETTES

Suddenly bathed in sunlight. PAN SHOT UP until we‘re on a
LONG ANGLE LOOKING UP at Williams's face as suddenly it is
bathed in sunlight. He has a smile that is almost ethereal.

CONDUCTOR TWO'S VOICE
Willoughby next stop. Willoughby!

101. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS
As he jumps to his feet and shouts.

WILLIAMS
Willoughby! That‘s where I get off.
Willoughby! That's my station!

CONDUCTOR.TWO
(just coming alongside, smiles
and winks) )
Yes, sir. That's your station,
Willoughby.

25.

102. EXT. TRAIN STATION

Looking toward the car that Williams is in as we can see him
walking through the doors to the platform then down the steps
and toward the camera. Two boys pass carrying fishing rods.

BOY ONE
Hi, Mr. Williams.

BOY TWO
Hi, Mr. Williams.

103. CLOSE SHOT WILLIAMS
First, mystified, then overjoyed.
WILLIAMS
Hi, boys. Catch some big ones today, huh?

I think tomorrow I‘ll join you.

BOY ONE
Plenty of room! And lotsa fish.

They continue on.
104. LONG SHOT MAN ON A WAGON
As he waves.

MAN
Hi, Mr. Williams. Welcome:

WILLIAMS
Thank you. Thank you...I'm...I'm glad to
be here.

105. MOVING SHOT WILLIAMS

As he goes beyond the station, heading toward the main
street. We can see and hear people greeting him and welcoming
him.

106. DIFFERENT ANGLE WILLIAMS

As he walks toward the camera and is suddenly surrounded by
people, all in period dress, who walk with him.

107. ANGLE SHOT LOOKING AT CLOCK IN STORE WINDOW

As Williams passes. There in the window is a grandfather
clock. The CAMERA.MOVES IN VERY TIGHT on it until we see the
pendulum going back and forth. CAMERA CONTINUES TO DOLLY in
on the pendulum.

26.

108. DIFFERENT ANGLE THE PENDULUM

As it swings.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

109. EXT. FIELD [NIGHT] CLOSE ON LANTERN

That swings back and forth in the same cadence as the
grandfather clock. The CAMERA MOVES until it is shooting down
on the body of Gart Williams who lies face up in the snow, a
white coated intern leaning over him and beyond the intern
two trainmen, one of whom holds the lantern. The intern
rises, motions to another attendant. They lift the body of
Williams to a stretcher and start to carry it out of the

scene .

TRAINMAN ONE
Just jumped off the train, did he?

CONDUCTOR
Shouted somethin' about Willoughby, ran
out to the platform and that‘s the last I
seen him. Doctor said he musta died
instantly. They're gonna take him into
town for an autopsy. Funeral parlor there
sent the ambulance.

TRAINMAN ONE
Poor fellah.

110. ANGLE SHOT LOOKING DOWN ON THE INTERN AND THE ATTENDANT
Carrying the body over to a waiting ambulance.

111. DIFFERENT ANGLE LOOKING TOWARD THE REAR END OF THE
AMBULANCE

Its back door is wide open. The stretcher is lifted gently
and through into the back. Then the attendant closes both the
doors and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN for a CLOSE SHOT of the
lettering on the back of the doors which reads, "WILLOUGHBY
AND SON, FUNERAL HOME." CAMERA STAYS on this shot for a long,
long moment, then the ambulance's engine is started, thrown
into gear and it moves and it moves off into the darkness.
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP toward the sky as we hear the
Narrator‘s Voice.

NARRATOR‘S VOICE
Mr. Gart Williams, who sought respite
from torment under a gravestone; who
climbed on a world that went by too fast
and then...jumped off.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

NARRATOR'S VOICE (cont‘d)
Mr. Gart Williams, who might now tell us
what awaits us in the beyond...because

this, too, is a part of...The Twilight
Zone!

FADE TO BLACK.
