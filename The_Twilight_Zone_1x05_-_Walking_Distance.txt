EXT. SKY [NIGHT]

Shot of the sky... the various nebulae and planet bodies
stand out in sharp, sparkling relief. As the CAMERA begins a
SLOW PAN across the Heavens——

NARRATOR'S VOICE (0.8.)
There is a fifth dimension beyond that
which is known to man. It is a dimension
as vast as space and timeless as
infinity. It is the middle ground
between light and shadow —— between
science and superstition, and it lies
between the pit of man's fears and the
summit of his knowledge. This is the
dimension of imagination. It is an area
which we call The Twilight Zone.

The CAMERA has begun to PAN DOWN until it passes the horizon
and is flush on the OPENING SHOT (EACH WEEK THE OPENING SHOT
OF THE PLAY)

EXT. SMALL TWO PUMP GAS STATION [DAY]

Long shot looking beyond it up the road A small red foreign
car approaches toward the CAMERA, slows down, then pulls

into the gas station. At the wheel is Martin Sloan, a man in
his middle thirties. He shuts off the ignition after stopping
the car by one of the pumps, closes his eyes for a moment,
then looks at the attendant who's working on an engine part
in front of the station. Martin presses down on the horn two
or three times, angry, impatient calls for service. The
ATTENDANT looks up at him, very slowly and deliberately puts
the engine part down. Martin honks once more.

ATTENDANT
Whenever you're finished, mister.

MARTIN
What about some service?

ATTENDANT
What about some quiet?

3. Close shot Martin As he suddenly unbends. His features

sag, he bites his lip.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MARTIN
(softly)
I'm sorry.
(as the attendant )
(approaches him)
Would you fill it up, please?

ATTENDANT
Sure.

MARTIN
(still rather softly)
I said I was sorry.

ATTENDANT
(looks over his )
shoulder)
I heard you.

4. Close shot Martin As he looks at himself in the rear view
mirror of the car. Over this we hear the Narrator' s voice.

FADE ON:

NARRATOR'S VOICE
The mirror image of Martin Sloan. Age
thirty- -six. Occupation—- vice president,
ad agency, in charge of media. This is
not just a Sunday drive for Martin
Sloan. He perhaps doesn t know it at the

time... but it's an exodus. Somewhere up
the road he 5 looking for sanity.

(a pause)
And somewhere up the road —— he' 11 find

something else.

DISSOLVE TO:

OPENING BILLBOARD

EXT. GAS STATION [DAY] FULL SHOT

Martin gets out of the car and walks over to the pump.

6. Two Shot Martin and the Attendant

ATTENDANT
(turns to him)
Oil change and lube job —— is that what

you want?

Martin nods.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ATTENDANT
It'll take about an hour.

MARTIN
All right.
(he turns to look toward the
road)
That's Homewood up ahead, isn't it?

ATTENDANT
Yep. A mile and a quarter.

MARTIN
I used to live there. Grew up there as
a matter of fact. I haven't been back in
twenty —— twenty—five years.

7. Track shot Martin As he takes a few steps away from the
pump, half way to the road, his back to the attendant.

MARTIN

Twenty —— twenty—five years. And then
yesterday afternoon I... I just got in
the car and drove. Reached a point where
I, well... I had to get out of New York.
One more board meeting, phone call,
report, problem——

(he laughs but the laugh comes

out in a strained, sick kind

of way)
I'd have probably jumped out of a
window.

8. Close shot Martin He lets his face relax, embarrassed by
the intensity of the tone. He turns to look at the attendant

again.

MARTIN
Walking distance, is it?

MED. CLOSE SHOT ATTENDANT

ATTENDANT
About a mile and a half.

CLOSE SHOT MARTIN

MARTIN
(softly)
That's walking distance.

11. Pan shot over to mirror over the cigarette machine We
see Martin's reflection on the road in the middle of a long

walk off into the distance.
LAP DISSOLVE TO:

12. Reflection of Martin in drugstore mirror As he‘s just

entering.
INT. DRUGSTORE FULL SHOT THE ROOM

A soda jerk named Charlie sits on a stool behind the fountain
reading a magazine, occasionally taking a drag of a cigar
which he puts back into an ashtray under the counter. The
subtle suggestion of the room.is that it's old-fashioned.

The equipment is from twenty years ago. The ads are not
flamboyantly old, but as a part of a whole —— they look
different in a subtle way. Martin walks into the store, looks
around briefly, smiles at what he sees, goes over to the
counter, nods at the soda jerk who puts the cigar down and
rises, walks to a point opposite him behind the fountain
counter.

CHARLIE
What'll it be?

MARTIN
(pushing down a kind of
excitement that comes from
being back in this place)
You still make great chocolate sodas?
Three scoops?

CHARLIE
(looking at him a
little fish—eyed)
How's that?

MARTIN

(laughs softly, and a

little apologetically)
I used to spend half my life in this
drugstore. I grew up here. The one
thing I remember always ordering ——
that was a chocolate ice cream.soda
with three scoops and it was ten
cents too.

The soda jerk looks at him a little quizzically then shrugs,
turns, starts to fix the soda. Every now and then he looks
at the reflection of Martin in the mirror. Martin is looking
around the room.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

(3)

MARTIN
You know, you look familiar to me,
as if I'd seen you before.

CHARLIE
(shrugs)
I got that kind of a face.

MARTIN
It's been a long time. Twenty years.
That's when I left here.
(then he laughs at
some collection of
secret thoughts)
I wish I had a buck for every hour I
sat at this fountain though, from
grammar school right through third
year high.
(then he turns and
looks toward the
front door)
The town looks the same, too.
(he turns back to
Charlie)
Really amazing, you know? In twenty
years to look so exactly the same.

The soda jerk stirs the soda, carries it over to him, puts
it down in front of him, takes a paper napkin, lays it

alongside.

CHARLIE
That'll be a dime.

Martin starts to fish in his pocket, then stops abruptly,
then incredulously——

MARTIN
A dime?
(he holds the soda up)
Three scoops?

CHARLIE
That's the way we make them.

MARTIN
(laughs)
You're gonna lose your shirt. Nobody
sells sodas for a dime anymore.

CHARLIE
They don't? Where you from?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (4)

MARTIN
New York.
(he takes a sip of
the soda, spoons
down some ice cream)
You make a great soda.

He takes another swig from the soda.

CHARLIE
Taste okay?

MARTIN
Wonderful.

There‘s a few slurping sounds from the bottom of the glass
as the last of the soda disappears. Martin puts the glass
back on the counter, looks around again.

MARTIN

Funny. How many memories you connect
with a place. I always thought if I
ever came back here -— it‘d probably
be all changed.

(he looks around the

store)
But it's just as if I'd left
yesterday.

(he rises and goes to
the front door, stares
out at the street)
Just as if I'd been away over night.

(he turns back, smiles
toward the soda jerk)
I'd almost expect Mr. Wilson to be
sitting in the stock room and sleeping
just like he always did before he
died. That's one of the images I
have. Old Man Wilson sleeping in his
big comfortable chair in the other
room.
(he points to the far door at
the other end of the room,then
reaches in his pocket, takes
out a dollar bill, takes it
over to the counter, puts it
down)
Thanks very much.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED: (5)

CHARLIE
(stares at the bill)
That's a buck!

MARTIN
(smiles, taps the
glass then makes a
motion to include
the whole room)
That.. and this, it's worth it.

He turns, walks back to the door and goes outside. The soda
jerk shakes his head as if just not understanding the
complexity of that man, takes the glass, puts it in the sink.
In doing so he notices a couple of open syrup containers,
checks them, then walks over toward the door at the far end
of the room. THE CAMERA BEHIND HIM now, looks toward the
room where a white haired man sits dozing in a big old—
fashioned chair.

CHARLIE
Mr. Wilson?

The old man opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, smacks his
lips, rubs his jaw —— part of a ritual of waking up.

WILSON
Yup, Charlie?

CHARLIE
We‘re gonna need some more chocolate
syrup, Mr. Wilson.

WILSON

(nods)
I'll order some this afternoon.

Then he winks, grins, closes his eyes and goes back to sleep
as we:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET LONG SHOT LOOKING DOWN THE STREET
Martin comes into the frame, his back to the camera. He
stops, then turns profile to camera to look from house to
house. There's a smile on his face as if this too were part
of a memory that all fitted into place.

15. Track shot with him As he walks down the street studying
the houses, nodding occasionally.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED : ( 6)

16. Track shot closer on Martin As he calls off the names of
the houses.

MARTIN
Van Buren. Wilcox.
(then looking across
the street)
Over there Dr. Bradbury. Mulroony.

Then he looks back on his side of the street again and stops.

17. Med. long shot small boy Kneeling down in his front yard
playing marbles by himself. Martin comes into the frame.

18. Close profile shot Martin He smiles and then laughs
softly.

19. Two shot Martin and the boy As the boy looks up at him.

BOY
Hi.

MARTIN
(points to marbles)
You pretty good?

BOY
At aggies? Not bad.

MARTIN
I used to shoot marbles too. We gave
them special names.

(he holds up his

fingers to form a

circle)
The steel kind... the ball bearings
we got off streetcars —— we called
them steelies. And the ones you could
see through -— they were clearies.
Still call them names like that?

The boy slowly rises, studying Martin with great interest but
with a hint of trepidation. He nods.

BOY
Sure.

MARTIN
(points to the telephone pole)
And over there we used to play hide and
seek.
(he smiles again.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (7)

MARTIN (cont'd)
It's almost as if he were
dredging up these memories for
himself and putting them out
into the
air)
Draw a circle around the old man's back
and who's to punch it.

(then he laughs, shakes his
head, looks down at the boy
again)
Right on this street, too. Right
over there. And I used to live in
that corner house down there.
(he points)

The big white one.

BOY
The Sloan house?

MARTIN
(a little wide eyed)
That's right! You still call it that?

BOY
Still call it what?

MARTIN
The Sloan house. My name's Sloan. I'm
Martin Sloan. What's your name?

He holds out a hand. The boy backs away, frightened.

BOY
You're not Marty Sloan. I know Marty
Sloan and you're not him.

MARTIN
I'm not, huh?

(he reaches into his coat
pocket, takes out a wallet)
Let‘s see what the driver's license

says, huh?

20. Close shot his hands Opening the wallet.

21. Med. close shot Martin As he looks down at it and then
holds it out.

MARTIN
See?

(CONTINUED)

10.
CONTINUED: (8)

22. Med. close shot spot on sidewalk Where the boy was. He's
no longer there. Martin looks off in the direction of the
boy's exit. His face is suddenly thoughtful, then he turns
and looks down the street and he starts to walk.

23. Long shot Martin As he approaches the camera. He's now
at the corner and he stops and studies the house in front of
him, a big white two story Victorian. A white fence surrounds
it. He slowly reaches down and unlatches the front gate,
walks up the front walk up the steps, stands by the front
door.

24. Close shot his hand As it very slowly reaches for the
bell. He pushes the button. There's the sound of footsteps
from inside. The door opens. A middle aged man stands there.
He smiles warmly.

MAN
Yes?

25. Close shot Martin His eyes wide, his face goes white,
and he just stands there, stock still, silently.

TWO SHOT
MAN
(his smile fading a
little)
Yes? Who did you want to see?
MARTIN
(his voice almost a whisper)

Dad. Dad.

WOMAN'S VOICE
(from inside the house)
Who is it, Robert?

MARTIN
(questioningly)
Mom? Is that Mom?

ROBERT
Who are you? What do you want here?

MARTIN
(shaking his head with
disbelief and yet emotionally
torn by the sight of loved
ones he‘s not seen in so many

years)
Why are you both here? How can you
be here?

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED: (9)

27. Med. long shot looking through the door As a woman
appears behind Robert. She looks questioningly from Robert to
Martin.

WOMAN
Who is it? What do you want, young
man?

Martin takes a step toward them. His nervously shaking hands
extend outward as if to embrace them.

MARTIN
Mom, don‘t you know me? It's Martin.

WOMAN
Martin?
(and then wide—eyes,
frightened, to her
husband in a stage
whisper)
He's a lunatic or something.

Robert is about to close the door and Martin sticks a foot
against it.

MARTIN
Wait a moment. Mom, you mustn't be
frightened of me. This is Martin. I grew
up here.

(and then unable to understand
the enormity of the mystery)
What's the matter with you both? Don‘t

you know your own son?

Robert starts to push the door closed and Martin struggles
with him, trying to keep it open.

MARTIN
Dad, please. Mom, look at me. Dad...

But the door is closed tight in his face now and he stands
there staring at it. He takes a step back away from the
door, turns to face the street, his face a mask now, totally
unable to comprehend. Then very slowly his eyes go down
toward the porch floor and the newspaper.

28. Track shot As he slowly walks down the steps of the porch
to the sidewalk.

29. Long shot a 1934 Roadster Sitting at the curb. A big
sign is pasted on it.

(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED: (10)

"This brand new 1934 Roadster to be given away free at the
legion hall, Thursday night. Buy your chances now at the
high school!"

30. Close shot Martin Reacting.
31. Close shot lettering "1934" On the sign.

32. Close shot Martin As he slowly turns away to look back
toward his house, staring at it with a strange mixture of
hunger and disbelief.

FADE TO BLACK
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
FADE ON:
EXT. PARK [DAY] A LONG SHOT DOWN A TREE—LINED PATH

It's warm and summery and occasionally kids flit by carrying
cotton candy, ice cream cones, et al. Turning the bend and
becoming visible facing the camera is Martin. He walks
slowly, drinking in the sights and sounds as he does so. Off
in the distance is the sound of a calliope, its tinny, rag
time dissonance so rich in nostalgia that Martin has to
pause momentarily and listen.

34. Track shot with him As he walks down the path taking in
passing sights like an organ grinder, a cotton candy vendor,
a Good Humor man and children —— always children. The path
branches off and at this fork Martin stops and looks across
at a clearing.

CUT TO:

35. Reverse angle looking toward the clearing In the middle
is a large band stand and pavilion set up with chairs in
preparation for the night concert. Several boys play around
its steps.

36. Track shot Martin As he walks toward the pavilion. He
stands down at the foot of the steps and looks up at it. A
young woman wheeling a baby carriage pauses close by. They
exchange a look and the woman smiles.

MARTIN
Wonderful place, isn't it?

WOMAN
The park? It certainly is.

(CONTINUED)

l3.
CONTINUED:

Martin listens for a moment as the calliope music can still
be heard. Martin jerks his thumb in the direction of the
music.

MART IN
That's a part of summer, isn‘t it?
The music from.the merry—go-round.
The calliope.

WOMAN
(laughing)
And the cotton candy. And the ice
cream. And the band concert.

MARTIN
(a little disjointed, unable to
put into words the nostalgia
he's feeling now)
There isn‘t anything quite as good
ever. Nothing quite as good as summer
and being a kid.

WOMAN
Are you from around here?
MARTIN
No —- what I mean is —— I used to be. I

lived just a couple of blocks away. I
remember this band stand. I used to sneak
away at night, lie over there on the
grass staring up at the stars, listening
to the music.

(the recollection of

this feeds his memory

and makes him become

voluble and excited)
I played ball in that field over there.

(he points)
And that merry—go-round. Oh my goodness —-
I grew up with that merry—go—round.

(then his eyes darting around,

he points up to one of the

posts of the pavilion)
I carved my name on that post one summer.
I was eleven years old and I carved my
name right on that—-

37. Flash shot a small boy About eleven. He has a pen knife
out and is in the process of carving something on the post.

38. Track shot Martin As he runs toward the post. The boy
looks up frightened.

(CONTINUED)

14 .
CONTINUED: (2)

He flings the knife away and backs off.MARTIN reaches the
post, grabs it and stares down at it. CUT TO:

39. Extremely tight close shot the post In a boyish scrawl
carved in the wood is the name "MARTIN SLOAN."

40. Med. shot Martin whirls around to look down at the boy.

MARTIN
Martin Sloan? You're Martin Sloan?

The boy takes another step backwards, frightened by the
intensity of Martin's look and voice.

BOY
Yes, sir. But I didn't mean nothin',
honest. Lots of kids carve their
names here. No kiddin‘. I‘m not the
first—-

MARTIN

(interrupts, taking a step

toward the boy)
You're Martin Sloan. Sure, that’s who
you are. That's the way I looked——
The boy is at this moment terribly
frightened by the intensity on Martin's
face.

He backs away down the steps and suddenly breaks into a
run.MARTIN, his face contorted with excitement and discovery,
calls after the boy.

MARTIN
Martin: Martin, don't be frightened ——
Hey, Martin-—

He starts to take a few running steps after the boy and then
stops just a few feet away from the pavilion.

41. Long angle shot looking down He turns very slowly to see
the woman staring at him. There's a curiosity on the woman's
face and almost an accusation. Martin's voice is hesitant
now. He points in the direction of where the boy has run and
disappeared.

MARTIN
I didn't want to hurt him. I just wanted
to talk to him... ask him some questions.
I was going to tell him what would happen
to him.
(now he closes his eyes tightly
and runs a hand over his
forehead)

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED: (3)

MARTIN (cont'd)
I don't know. I really don't know.
(now he opens his eyes)
If it's a dream... I suppose I'll wake

up.

42. Extremely tight close shot Martin's face As he looks off,
listens to the sound of the music.

MARTIN
(softly, but with and
intensity)
But I don't want it to be a dream.
(he looks at the woman now and
there are tears in his eyes)
I don't want time to pass now.

The woman, very, very ill at ease, with an attempt at
nonchalance, starts to wheel the carriage away.

MARTIN
You don‘t understand, do you? Please.
Let me tell you what's happened to
me...

(he takes a step after
her)
Please...

The woman continues to wheel the carriage away from him.

43. Long shot the woman She gets to one of the paths leading
to the pavilion. She stops, turns and looks at him again. At
this point Martin walks hurriedly out of the pavilion area.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. STREET [NIGHT] MED LONG SHOT

Looking toward the front porch of the Sloan house. Robert
sits on the porch on a glider. There is the sound of the
creak of the swinging back and forth and other night sounds
of crickets, a distant bull frog, the soft rustle of a July
wind.

THE CAMERA MOVES IN for a closer shot of Robert on the porch.
He suddenly inches forward on the glider, listening. There

is the sound of footsteps on the sidewalk beyond, then Robert
rises and moves to the top of the porch steps. The light

from the lamp post shines on his face.

45. Pan shot over to the front of the house and front path

MARTIN stands there looking up toward the house. His foot
touches something. [He looks down.

46. Close shot baseball mitt He bends down and picks it up.

47. Med. close shot Martin He puts the glove on his hand,
pats out a pocket, smiles as he does so. Then he takes a few
steps toward the house. A bike is parked close to the steps.
|Martin walks over to it, touches it, rings the bell on the
handlebar. Then he looks up at his father who is staring at

48. Close shot Robert He's interested now but not frightened.

ROBERT
Back again, huh?

TWO SHOT BOTH MEN

MARTIN
(nods)
I had to come back. This is my house.
(he looks down at the
glove in his hand)
This is mine, too. You bought it for me
on my eleventh birthday.
(then he looks up toward his
father)
What about the baseball that Lou Gehrig
autographed? Where's that?

50. Close shot Robert As he reacts. He takes the pipe out of
his mouth, looks intensely at the younger man.

ROBERT
(softly)
Who are you? What do you want here?

51. Med. shot He strikes a match and in the brief flare he
studies Martin‘s face.

MARTIN
I just want to rest. I just want to
stop running for a while. I belong
here. Don‘t you understand, Pop? I
belong here.

ROBERT

(his voice very gentle)
Look, son, you're probably sick.
You've got delusions or something.
And I don't want to hurt you and I
don't want you to get into any trouble
either. But you better get out of
here or there will he trouble.

At this moment Mrs. Sloan comes out.

(CONTINUED)

17 .
CONTINUED: (5)

MRS. SLOAN
Who you talking to, Rob—-

She stops abruptly, eyes wide, when she sees Martin standing
at the foot of the steps. She hurriedly goes over to her
husband.

MARTIN
Mom, won't you look at me? Look into
my face. You can tell, can't you?

He takes a step up the porch. The woman shrinks back against
her husband.MARTIN's face is in the light of the street lamp.

MARTIN
Mom, just look at me. Please. Who am
I? Tell me who I am.

MRS. SLOAN
You're a stranger. I've never seen
you before. Robert, tell him to go
away.

MARTIN
You've got a son named Martin, haven't
you? He goes to Emerson Public School.

The month of August he spends at his aunt's farm near
Buffalo, and a couple of summers you've gone up to Saratoga
Lake and rented a cottage there. And once I had a sister and
she died when she was a year old.

MRS. SLOAN
(frightened, to her
husband)

Where's Martin now?

Martin grabs her. He's beyond logic now, beyond caring. He
has one single preoccupation and this is to prove who he is.
He grabs his mother.

MARTIN
I'm Martin! I'm your son! You've got
to believe me. I'm your son Martin.
(with one free hand he grabs at
his wallet and pulls it out
and starts tearing into the
cards and identification
inside)
See? See? All my cards are in here.
All my identification. Read them. Go

MARTIN (cont'd)
ahead, read them.
(he tries to force
them on her)
Please. They'll show you--

The woman, desperately frightened, struggling to get away,
suddenly hauls off and slaps Martin across the face. The
wallet slips out of his hand and there's a dead
silence.MARTIN slowly looks up to look from one to the other.

CUT TO:
52. Close shot of each As they stare back at him.

53. Med. group shot He slowly turns away, walks back to the
top of the steps, looks down at the baseball glove that he's
laid there.

54. Track shot of him As he walks down the steps, down the
front path to the gate. He pauses, looks back toward the
house.

55. Long shot the house His father and mother standing there
watching him. He opens the gate, steps out, stands there
aimlessly for a moment.

56. Close shot Martin As his head jerks up when he hears the
sound of the distant calliope. It grows louder and louder
until it is way out of proportion, discordant, loud,
shrieking, and he starts to run, shouting as he does.

MARTIN
Martin! Martin, I've got to talk to
you. Martin.

57. Long angle shot As he runs toward the park.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PARK [NIGHT] LONG SHOT DOWN THE PATH

It is now lit by street lamps. Off on the right is the light
of the calliope and the music. On the left is the sound of
the band in the pavilion and over this are a thousand voices
and sounds of laughter, soda pop, popcorn popping —— the
sounds of summer.

59. Med. close shot Martin As he steps out of the shadows
and comes into the periphery of light thrown by one of the
lamp posts. He looks tired now and yet compelled. His face
is tense, nervous, but gradually softens, as all the sounds
and the music penetrate his consciousness and once again he
succumbs to the poignance that comes with nostalgia.

(CONTINUED)

19 .
CONTINUED: (7)

He walks down the path and pauses near the clearing to the
pavilion listening to the music.

60. Close shot his profile As he listens and then smiles. He
takes a few steps into the clearing, leans on a tree for a
moment and slowly lets himself sink to the ground. He lies
there with his hands behind his head staring up at the sky,
listening to the band music. Pretty soon quite unconsciously
he begins to hum the tune that the band is playing and he is
suddenly aware of someone else humming the tune in a boyish
tone. Startled, he bolts upright to a sitting position, looks
to his right and there he sees Martin the boy. The boy jumps
up with a hushed, frightened cry and begins to run.

61. Long shot looking down the path As the boy races down it
and disappears around the bend. There is a beat and
thenMARTIN appears behind him running after him.

62. Moving shot through the crowd Near the calliope as the
boy pushes his way through people. A few feet behind him
isMARTIN. The boy reaches the ticket taker stand and tries to
force his way through.

TICKET TAKER
Nope, son. Not without a ticket, you
don't.

The boy whirls around staring at Martin who has almost
reached him now. He ducks under the turnstile and jumps on
the merry- go—round. The ticket taker starts to shout and
point toward him when suddenly he's pushed aside by Martin.

63. Angle shot looking down on the merry—go—round As the man
and boy thread their way past the horses that go up and down.

64-67. Closer shots in between the horses First the boy's
face and then Martin's, first covered by the horses as they
go up, then revealed as the horses go down. Each time the
boy's face looks more and more petrified and frozen with
fear and each time they appear and reappear Martin is closer
until suddenly we

CUT TO:
68. Flash shot In this brief moment they are now face to

face with nothing between them.MARTIN holds out his hands
pleadingly -— supplicatingly.

MARTIN
Marty, I don't want to hurt you,
son. I just want to tell you something -—
Martin! Please. Let me talk to you.
Let me tell you something.

69. Close shot the boy As he looks over his shoulder. We see
the machinery of the merry-go-round from the moving platform
on which the boy stands. Martin takes a step toward him now.

MARTIN
Marty, please son——

At this point the boy, frantic, jumps toward the machinery.
We hear his scream as we

70. Flash shot Martin As he too screams in pain and grabs
his leg.

71. Tight close shot the merry—go-round operator's face His
eyes dilate with horror. A woman screams.

72. Close shot operator's hand on the level As he pulls it
back with a giant squeaking sound.

73. Angle shot looking up toward the horses as people race
toward the center of the merry—go-round. Ad lib voices can
be heard over the din.

74. Long angle shot looking down toward the area around the
merry-go—round As the little boy is gently carried out.

75. Close shot profile of the little boy's body As he's
carried past. One leg looks misshapen under the torn, oily
trouser leg. Across this leg we see Martin who has pushed
his way to the front of the crowd and looks horror struck
toward the figure of the boy.

CUT TO:

76. Long angle shot looking down on the area Pretty soon the
place becomes deserted and only Martin stands there. The
merry—go-round slows down and keeps slowing down until
finally it stops. The lights go out leaving the place in
shadows.MARTIN walks through the turnstile over to one of the
wooden horses. He sees the boy's cap lying there and he
picks it up.

MARTIN
(very softly and gently)
I only wanted to tell you. I only wanted
to tell you this is the wonderful time
for you. Don't let any of it go by
without... without enjoying it. There
won't be any more merry-go—rounds. No
more cotton candy. No more band concerts.

MARTIN (cont‘d)
I only wanted to tell you that this is

all, MARTIN. That's all I wanted to tell
you. God help me, that's all I wanted to
tell you.

SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

The calliope, etc.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MERRY-GO-ROUND [NIGHT]

It's now very late. The CAMERA PANS over for a shot of Martin
sitting on the edge of the merry-go—round. One leg is
stretched out stiffly in front of him.

He looks up at the sound of footsteps.

82. Long shot looking toward the turnstile As his father
comes into the frame and walks toward him, stopping just a
few feet from him.

TWO SHOT THE TWO MEN

ROBERT
I thought you'd want to know the boy
will be all right. He may limp some
the doctor says, but he'll be all
right.

MARTIN
I thank God for that.

Robert takes Martin‘s wallet out of his pocket, hands it to
him, then he takes a pipe out and lights it. And once again
in the glare of the match the two men look at one another.

ROBERT
You dropped this by the house. I
looked inside.

MARTIN
And?

ROBERT
It told quite a few things about
you. Driver's license, cards, the
money in it. It seems that you're
Martin Sloan. You're thirty—six years
old. You have an apartment in New
York.

(CONTINUED)

22 .
CONTINUED: (10)

ROBERT (cont’d)
(a pause)
And it says your license expires in
1960. That's twenty-five years from
now. The dates on the bills. Those
dates haven‘t come yet either.

84. Close shot Martin As he stares at his father.

MARTIN
You know now then, don't you?

85. TWO SHOT

ROBERT

(looks at him for a

long moment, softly)
Yes, I know. I know who you are and
I know you've come from a long ways
from here. A long ways and... and a
long time. I don't know why or how ——
do you?

Martin shakes his head.

ROBERT
But you know other things, don't
you, Martin? Things that will happen.

MARTIN
(nods)
Yes, I do.

ROBERT
You also know when your month and
I... when we‘ll...

MARTIN
(in a whisper)
Yes, I know that too.

ROBERT

(takes the pipe out of his

mouth, studies it for a

moment)
Don't tell me. There‘s a saying.
"Every man is put on earth condemned
to die. Time and method of exeCution
unknown." That‘s a part of the
mystery we live with. It must always
be a mystery.

(then he rises)

(CONTINUED)

23.
CONTINUED: (ll)

MARTIN.
Martin?
(looks up at him)
Yes, Dad?
ROBERT

(puts his hand on

Martin's shoulder)
You have to leave here. There's no
room for you... and there's no place.
Do you understand?

MARTIN
(nods, slowly)
I see that now. But I don’t
understand. Why not?

ROBERT

(softly)
I guess because we only get one
chance.

(a crooked smile)
Maybe there's only one summer to a
customer.

(and then with great

compassion)
The little boy... the one I know.
The one who belongs here. This is
his summer, Martin. Just as it was
yours one time. Don't make him share
it.

Martin rises. He walks slowly down the steps, pauses at the
foot and stares off into the night.

ROBERT
Is it... is it so bad —— where you're
from?

MARTIN

I thought so. I've been living...

I've been living at a dead run, Dad.

I was so tired. And then... one day...
I knew I had to come back. I had to
come back to get on a merry—go—round
and listen to a band concert and eat
cotton candy. I had to stop and
breathe and close my eyes and smell
and listen.

ROBERT
(very softly)
I guess we all want that. But, Martin,
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)

24.
CONTINUED: (12)

ROBERT (cont'd)
when you go back... maybe you'll
find that there are merry-go—rounds
and band concerts where you are.
Maybe you haven't looked in the right
place. You've been looking behind
you, Martin. Try looking ahead.

MARTIN
Maybe. Goodbye, Dad.

Robert nods and starts to walk away. He stops by the
turnstile

and turns.

ROBERT
(gently)
Goodbye... son.

86. Close shot Martin As he stands there. He looks down at
the wallet, taps at it thoughtfully with a finger and then
slowly puts it inside his coat. Then he turns and looks at
the merry-go—round.

87. Med. long shot his p.o.v.

Of the horses. The lights go on suddenly, and there is the
creak as the merry—go—round starts to turn. He climbs up on
the platform and stands holding one of the posts that go up
and down with the horses and starts to go around with it.

88. Pan shot with him as he moves 89. Pan shot of the
calliope

Where the music's coming from.

ABRUPT CUT TO:

90. Med close shot a juke box As it blares out rock—n—roll.
PULL BACK FOR

INT. DRUGSTORE [DAY]

It's the same drugstore we've seen except now it‘s done in
chrome, leather and flash. It‘s plastered with advertising
signs, suggesting the purchase of everything from filtered
cigarettes to reducing pills and tranquilizers. The soda
jerk is no longer Charlie. Martin comes in through the front
door. He walks with a stiff gait and goes over to the soda

fountain.

SODA JERK
Hi. Something for you?

(CONTINUED)

25.
cmmnmmn(1m

The music now stops and the two young couples go to a booth
laughing and talking. Martin looks over at them for a moment,
then turns back to the soda jerk.

MARTIN
Maybe a chocolate soda, huh? Three
dips?
SODA JERK

Three? I can make one with three
dips for you. It'll be extra. Thirty—
five cents. Okay?

MARTIN
(smiles at him)
Thirty—five cents, huh?
(his eyes scan the
room)
How about old Mr. Wilson? Used to
own this place.

SODA JERK
Oh, he died. Long time ago. Must be
fifteen —— twenty years. What kind
of ice cream you want? Chocolate?
Vanilla?
MARTIN
(looks at him for
moment)

I've changed my mind. Guess I‘ll
pass on the soda.
(he rises off the stool, doing
so with difficulty, his stiff
leg getting in the way)
These stools weren't built for bum
legs, were they?

SODA JERK
Guess not. Get it in the war?

MARTIN
No. No, as a matter of fact I got it
falling off the merry—go—round when
I was a kid. Freak thing. Fell into
the machinery.

SODA JERK
The merry-go—round? Oh, yeah, I do
remember. They tore that down a few
years ago. Condemned it.
(then with a smile)
A little late I guess, huh?

(CONTINUED)

26.
CONTINUED: (14)

MARTIN
How's that?

SODA JERK
A little late for you I mean.

MARTIN
(looks away, very
softly)
Very late. Very late for me.

He starts to walk slowly across the room and out the door.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ROAD [DAY] LONG SHOT MARTIN WALKING
EXT. GAS STATION [DAY]
As Martin enters and we can see him talking to the attendant.

DISSOLVE TO:

94. The red car With Martin in it as it pulls onto the
highway from the gas station, pauses there.

95. Med. close shot Martin As he looks in both directions and
in doing so lets his gaze fall on a roadsign.

96. Close shot road sign It reads ”Homewood —- 1 1/2 miles."

97. Close shot Martin As he reacts. Just the briefest moment
of thought, then he puts the car into low gear.

98. Long angle shot looking down As the car slowly starts
onto the highway. Over the disappearing car we hear the

Narrator‘s Voice.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
Martin Sloan, age thirty—six. Vice president in charge of
media. Successful in most things -- but not in the one

effort that all men try at some time in their lives ——
trying to go home again. (a pause) And also like all men

perhaps there'll be an occasion... maybe a summer night
some time... when he'll look up from what he's doing and
listen to the distant music of a calliope —— and hear the

voices and the laughter of the people and the places of his
past. And perhaps across his mind there'll flit a little
errant wish... that a man might not have to become old ——
never outgrow the parks and the merry-go—rounds of his
youth.

(CONTINUED)

27.
CONTINUED: (15)

(a pause) And he'll smile then too because he'll know it is
just an errant wish. Some wisp of memory not too important
really. Some laughing ghosts that cross a man‘s mind... that

are a part of The Twilight Zone.

Now the CAMERA PANS back down the road to the sign that reads

"Homewood -- 1 1/2 miles."

FADE TO BLACK.
