Live at L.A. Podcast Festival
b'This transcript is of the Welcome to Night Vale performance at the L.A. Podcast Festival on the 5th of October, 2013. The performance consisted of two previously released episodes: The Shape in Grove Park and The Man in the Tan Jacket. However, there was new material added (and some short sections removed), and James Urbaniak was there as a guest voice, playing the role of Night Vale Community Radio intern. The weather was performed by Sara Watkins.\n\n\n Video of the performance is available from LA Podfest in two parts: Part 1 Part 2\n\n\n The Shape in Grove Park\n\n\n Close your eyes. Let my words wash over you. You are safe now.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Local historians are protesting the removal of the Shape in Grove Park that No One Acknowledges or Speaks About. While their protest has been hampered by the fact that none of them will acknowledge or speak about it, they did \xe2\x80\x94 through a system of gestures and grimaces \xe2\x80\x94 convey the message that, whatever the Shape is, and whatever its effects on nearby neighborhoods, it is a Night Vale landmark and should be protected.\n\n\n The Shape itself offered no comment \xe2\x80\x94 only a low moaning and gelatinous quiver. The City Council would not provide any reason for the removal, but they did say that any work in Grove Park was making way for a new swing set, picnic area, and bloodstone circle, which we all can agree are good contributions to our community.\n\n\n The Night Vale Green Market Co-Op announces today that, after 15 years, they will begin selling fruits and vegetables. Green Market Board President Tristan Cortez said that recent customer surveys indicated that shoppers have grown tired of empty pickup trucks and vacant tents lining the City Hall parking lot every Sunday morning in the summer and fall.\n\n\n Cortez said that research indicates consumers are more likely to buy products if they are available and for sale, and that Green Market and Grocery shoppers tend to purchase food items. Cortez says that the decision to sell food at the Green Market was a controversial one, as many board members and Co-Op shareholders feel fruit and vegetable sales will interfere with their ongoing secretive domestic espionage operations.\n\n\n When reached for comment, our source within the Secret Police only breathed heavily into the phone while tapping an as-yet uncracked code into the receiver.\n\n\n Michael Sandero, starting quarterback for the Night Vale Scorpions, has reportedly grown a second head. It is not currently known whether this is a result of the previously reported lightning strike, or just another odd coincidence in this kid\xe2\x80\x99s odd life.\n\n\n People in the know say that the new head is looking better, smarter than the first one, and even Michael\xe2\x80\x99s mother has issued a statement indicating that she likes it much better than her son. And that she will be changing the rankings on the public \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of My Children I Like Best\xe2\x80\x9d board outside of her house.\n\n\n Sandero could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n Probably.\n\n\n We didn\xe2\x80\x99t really try.\n\n\n Friends, listeners; there\xe2\x80\x99s a real tarantula problem here in Night Vale. Many residents have called in to report that illiteracy, unwanted pregnancy, and violent crime are on the rise in the tarantula communities. Animal control is addressing these concerns through after school programs called \xe2\x80\x9cTeach a Spider to Read \xe2\x80\x94 Stop the Madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Those interesting in volunteering should stand in their bathtubs and weep until it is all gone.\n\n\n Nothing left.\n\n\n You can let go now.\n\n\n Let go.\n\n\n Shhhhh.\n\n\n Let go.\n\n\n And now a message from our sponsor.\n\n\n Uh, Intern Leland, who is our first sponsor for today\xe2\x80\x99s show?\n\n\n\n\n It is stamps dot com.\n\n\n Tired of waiting in line at the Post Office?

You are all our family now,\xe2\x80\x9d stamps dot com will say, stretching their many boneless arms around your entire family. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here. We are all a loving family.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Stamps dot com. You live in a dead world. We love you.\n\n\n\n\n Ah, thank you so much, Leland! And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, the rumor mill is abuzz. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a celebrity sighting in our little burgh!\n\n\n Old Woman Josie and one of her Angel friends reportedly saw Rita Hayworth getting gas at the Fuel \xe2\x80\x98n Go over by the bowling alley. Rita Hayworth, ladies and gentlemen! Right here in Night Vale. Can you believe it? Old Woman Josie said that Rita was looking a little bit older, moderately obese, and considerably more Hispanic, but the Angel assured her it was indeed Rita. And he is an Angel after all\xe2\x80\xa6he would know, right? Wow! Wow! Rita Hayworth! Here in Night Vale! Just imagine!\n\n\n And now, an update on the Shape Formerly in Grove Park that No One Acknowledges or Speaks About: it seems the City Council, in their superhuman mercy and all-seeing glory, have chosen to move the Shape directly in front of our own radio station, where it is continuing to be what can only be described as indescribable.\n\n\n The Shape was not available for comment as I could find no one willing to speak to it\xe2\x80\xa6or even meet my eye when I mentioned it. It has occurred to me that I may be the only one able to see it.\n\n\n Now that I think about it, I have also never bothered to actually check whether this mic is attached to any sort of recording or broadcasting device.\n\n\n And it is possible that I am alone, in an empty universe, speaking to no one, unaware that the world is held aloft merely by my delusions and my smooth, sonorous voice.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMore on this story as it develops,\xe2\x80\x9d I say, possibly only to myself.\n\n\n The Night Vale Community Theater is holding auditions for its fall show, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce On This Island.\xe2\x80\x9d Interested thespians should bring a head shot and resume to the Recreation Center auditorium on Thursday night.\n\n\n All auditionees must perform a one-minute monologue and sing one song. Bring sheet music along if you would like piano accompaniment. Auditionees will also be required to do a cold reading, and give blood and stool samples along with mandatory radiation testing following the auditions.\n\n\n Do not sing anything from South Pacific.\n\n\n People of color are urged to audition, as Night Vale Community Theater is an equal-opportunity employer.\n\n\n Oh, also, actors with long-range sniper training, FORTRAN computer programming, and top-notch wilderness survival skills are a plus.\n\n\n Final casting will be announced in secret via dirigible.\n\n\n No one can ever know.\n\n\n Update on the Green Market situation from earlier in our broadcast. Everything is exactly the same as when we last reported on it, and there is no new information.\n\n\n Listeners, do you ever think about the moon? I was sitting outside last night looking at the moon and I thought, does anyone actually know what that thing is? Have there been any studies on it? I went to ask Carlos, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen much since that treacherous Telly\xe2\x80\x99s vile haircut.\n\n\n The moon\xe2\x80\x99s weird though, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s there, and there, and then suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s not. And it seems to be pretty far up. Is it \xe2\x80\x93 is it watching us? If not, what is it watching instead? Is there something more interesting than us? Hey, watch us moon! We may not always be the best show in the universe, but we try.\n\n\n This has been today\xe2\x80\x99s Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor. Leland? Uh, who else do we have supporting our show?\n\n\n\n\n Well, Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take a second now to tell you about hulu dot com.\n\n\n Huuuuuuuuuuuuullluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about watching things. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about watching, rather than actually watching. Let\xe2\x80\x99s think about talking about watching a second-hand experience. Let\xe2\x80\x99s continually abstract ourselves from what we believe is the world.\n\n\n Huuuuuulluuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.\n\n\n The pulsing life of your body is an undeniable fact, but deny it anyway. Looking for the answers to all of life\xe2\x80\x99s problems? We recommend obstinate denial. Accept no substitute. Accept nothing.\n\n\n Huuuuuulluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!\n\n\n Water circles the drain of our planet, always coming back for one more go to see if the cycle will be different. It will not be different. The sky will break open, and water will fall, one more time.\n\n\n One more time.\n\n\n Huluuu.\n\n\n The terror you feel in quiet moments is not misplaced, just mis-timed.\n\n\n Hulu. Hulu. Hulu. Hulu. Hulu. Hulu. Hulu! Hulu!!\n\n\n Hulu dot com! Sign up now, and get the latest episode of\n\n\n [static sounds with a hint of distant horns, perhaps?]\n\n\n OK, that\xe2\x80\x99s it for me, see you later!\n\n\n\n\n Thank you, Leland!\n\n\n The Night Vale School District has announced some changes to the elementary school curriculum. They are as follows:\n\n\n In response to parent feedback, history classes will focus more heavily on textbook readings and traditional exams, rather than live ammo drills.\n\n\n Oh, geology is adding a new type of rock on the grounds that it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since anybody has done that. The new type of rock is \xe2\x80\x9cvimbee,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is categorized by its pale blue color, and the fact that it is completely edible. Points will be awarded to the first student to discover a real-world example of it.\n\n\n Math and English are switching names. Their curriculum will stay exactly the same.\n\n\n Astronomy will now be conducting stargazing sessions only with blindfolds on every participant, in order to protect them from the existential terror of the void.\n\n\n Oh, also, Pluto has been declared imaginary.\n\n\n All classrooms will be equipped with at least one teacher physically present for the entire instruction period. Astral projection will no longer be used in any classroom.\n\n\n And finally, in addition to the current foreign language offerings of Spanish, French, and Modified Sumerian, schools will now be offering Double Spanish, Weird Spanish, Coptic Spanish, Russian, and Unmodified Sumerian.\n\n\n And now a continuation of our previous investigation into whether I am literally the only person in the world, speaking to myself in a fit of madness caused by my inability to admit the tragedy of my own existence.\n\n\n Intern Leland recently brought me a cup of coffee. He is no longer in my field of vision, but I do still have the cup of coffee. Which is well made, and is giving me that needed pick-me-up to continue considering this terrifying possibility.\n\n\n Is it possible that I only imagined Leland, and forgot making myself this cup of coffee? But then, who would have grown this coffee? Where was this cup produced? Hmm.\n\n\n Oh, Leland is, uh, back in the room, and he\xe2\x80\x99s waving at me \xe2\x80\x94 um, hello, Leland \xe2\x80\x94 uh, he\xe2\x80\x99s saying\xe2\x80\xa6wait, what was that, Leland?\n\n\n\n\n Cecil, the Shape has turned a molten red, and is causing small whirlwinds in front of our radio station doors. There is the sound of a great many voices chanting, as though it were an army giving out a battle cry before raining down destruction on our arid little hamlet, I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Hang on\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n Listeners, Leland has stopped speaking, and is now writing furiously on a piece of paper. I have to say, Leland\xe2\x80\x99s existence, as well as his finally speaking about the Shape Which No One Else Would Speak About, has reassured me greatly about my lonely and solipsistic vigil here at this microphone.\n\n\n He is handing me the note \xe2\x80\x94 thank you, Leland \xe2\x80\x94 lemme see here\xe2\x80\xa6ahh.\n\n\n It says that the City Council believes the reason for the violent reaction of the Shape Formerly in Grove Park that No One Acknowledges or Speaks About is because I have been acknowledging and speaking about it, which has made it angry. They urge me to stop speaking of it, and never do it again. And in exchange they\xe2\x80\x99ll move it somewhere else so we can get our front loading zone back.\n\n\n After brief consideration, I have decided to accept the Council\xe2\x80\x99s offer, because they are trustworthy leaders looking out for our better future. And also because Leland just now got vaporized by a strange red light emanating from the station entrance.\n\n\n To the family of Leland, we thank you for his service to the cause of community radio, and we join you in mourning his loss.\n\n\n And, without further ado, nor ever again mentioning anything we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Me\xe2\x80\x9d by Sara Watkins]\n\n\n Hello listeners.\n\n\n In breaking news, the sky. The earth. Life.\n\n\n Existence as an unchanging plane, with horizons of birth and death in the faint distance.\n\n\n We have nothing to speak about. There never was. Words are an unnecessary trouble. Expression is time wasting away. Any communication is just a yelp in the darkness.\n\n\n Ladies, gentlemen, listeners, you.\n\n\n I am speaking now but I am saying nothing. I am just making noises and, as it happens, they are organized in words but you should not draw any meaning from this.\n\n\n The service for Leland was lovely. We threw flowers and wept. He was buried in the break room, as is our custom. His family came, and mooned around the office, as though we had answers.\n\n\n But we do not have answers. I am not certain that we even have questions. I have chosen to not be certain of anything at all.\n\n\n This is Cecil, generally, speaking to you, metaphorically, for Night Vale Community Radio.\n\n\n And I would like to say in the most nebulous terms possible, and with no real-world implications or insinuations of objective meaning:\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n Sara & Sean Watkins returns for music set. Song list:\n\n\n \n \xe2\x80\x9cLock & Key\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0by Sara Watkins\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9c21st of May\xe2\x80\x9d by Sean Watkins\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cJefferson\xe2\x80\x9d by Sara Watkins\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n The Man in the Tan Jacket\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, surely you have noticed\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s a Man in a Tan Jacket. Countless residents have seen him, but no one can seem to remember exactly what he looks like; just that he has a tan jacket and a deerskin suitcase. And he has been spotted all over town. But no one can quite recall specifically where they saw him, or what time of day it was \xe2\x80\x93 just that they saw him.\n\n\n Frances Donaldson \xe2\x80\x94 the tall woman with the green eyes who manages the antiques mall \xe2\x80\x94 thinks maybe the Man in the Tan Jacket is simply a shared dream. But I know that I saw him, Night Vale. I know what I saw. This man can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be a dream. He was so vivid. His eyes were\xe2\x80\xa6well, his nose and his chin\xe2\x80\xa6oh\xe2\x80\x94 oh, I can just see it! I just can\xe2\x80\x99t remember! The man was as clear as day! He had a tan jacket, and a deerskin suitcase.\n\n\n He can\xe2\x80\x99t be a dream, can he? Please, call in, listeners, and let us know if you can remember anything else.\n\n\n This Monday through Friday is the annual Night Vale Career Fair at the Downtown Convention Center. There will be dozens of booths, representing phony local businesses that will take your resumes and photos (via hidden surveillance cameras) and conduct sample interviews designed to badger you into implicating yourself in nefarious activities.\n\n\n First-generation Night Vale residents \xe2\x80\x94 particularly those whose parents were originally born in Maine, Massachusetts, Canada, Micronesia, and Suriname \xe2\x80\x94 are strongly encouraged to attend.\n\n\n This year\xe2\x80\x99s keynote speaker is an audio tape of droning moans leaden with subliminal tips about achieving personal prosperity and how to come clean about the terrible things you have done, you cretin.\n\n\n Last year\xe2\x80\x99s fair featured several very high-profile arrests \xe2\x80\x93 and some nice door prizes. Tickets are $25, or $15 if you still have working retinas to scan.\n\n\n Over the weekend, Teddy Williams \xe2\x80\x94 owner of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex \xe2\x80\x94 sent us some security camera footage of what he believes to be the first-ever glimpse of citizens of the Underground City deep below Lane Five.\n\n\n Early Saturday morning, Fun Complex cameras picked up blurry motion near the soda machine. The footage is quite fuzzy and difficult to discern. Perhaps it is merely rats or raccoons, digging through an uncovered supply of junk food. But it is, of course, much more likely that a lost nation of people, living in the bowels of a small-town bowling alley, are finally revealing themselves \xe2\x80\x93 taking our food supplies, and preparing for war.\n\n\n Teddy told us that he believes this city to be thousands strong and ready to move into Night Vale. Ready to take arms against the \xe2\x80\x9cUpper World\xe2\x80\x9d (as they probably call us). Ready to conquer this heaven and become the righteous owners of our sun-soaked precious land\xe2\x80\xa6we assume.\n\n\n It takes very little extrapolation to believe that they worship a god named Huntokhar, who demands sacrifice to keep their Underground City thriving in the absence of nourishing sunlight.\n\n\n And a fair assumption is they are ruled by a Child King, recently coronated, who is too weak to rein back the generals intent on marching upon us in war.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, if you care for your community, your town, your Night Vale like I do, please know that you will arm yourselves. You will rally your neighbors to militia. You will point fingers at those who do not wish to fight and have them rounded up into pens. This is no time for the weak. We are at a presumptive war with a projected enemy whom we cannot yet see, or even be certain of, but who are probably bloodthirsty giants.\n\n\n If you would like to learn more about starting a militia, simply learn to be a true American. And that is how you will know. And remember, Night Vale is at war. Your careless talk costs lives. They know we are here, and it seems somebody has talked.\n\n\n Who was it, Night Vale?\n\n\n Was it Steve Carlsberg? Did Steve Carlsberg talk?\n\n\n Maybe a group of good citizens should go have a \xe2\x80\x9cchat\xe2\x80\x9d with Steve and find out what he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying, and to whom.\n\n\n Stay by your radios, listeners. We will report further as events warrant.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n Intern Rob? Uh, who do we have sponsoring this segment of our show?\n\n\n\n\n That would be Squarespace!\n\n\n\n\n Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry about your cousin Leland, Rob.\n\n\n\n\n Thank you.\n\n\n\n\n He was a very good intern. Tell us about Squarespace.\n\n\n\n\n Sure.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy starting a small business. There are a lot of things to worry about, like building a customer base, developing a strong product, wrestling with self-doubt, crying a lot, bleeding a little, looking up in the small hours at the sagging ceiling of your too-small bed thinking \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, why?\xe2\x80\x9d, being overrun by rats and worms, and discovering that you\xe2\x80\x99re just matter \xe2\x80\x93 just rotting, organic matter, fated to feed the earth and trees.\n\n\n Yes, there are so many concerns facing small businesses. Web design shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be one of them.\n\n\n Want a simple, low-cost, and beautifully-designed web solution for your small business?\n\n\n Well, do you?\n\n\n Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you do, actually.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at your web page right now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely. It\xe2\x80\x99s really smooth, real easy to navigate\xe2\x80\xa6looks like you put a lot of work into this.\n\n\n You don\xe2\x80\x99t need our help. We won\xe2\x80\x99t even tell you who we are because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pressure you into changing what you\xe2\x80\x99ve already done with your website.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s perfect!\n\n\n Wow!\n\n\n Good job!\n\n\n We just\xe2\x80\x93 wow! Just\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to have interrupted.\n\n\n [starting to cry] I just want to say, you\xe2\x80\x99re really good at web design. [sniffles] You\xe2\x80\x99re much better than us. [gasping breath] Carry on. I\xe2\x80\x93 I guess.\n\n\n\n\n Thank you, Rob.\n\n\n More now on the Man in the Tan Jacket.\n\n\n Old Woman Josie called to tell us that her Angel friends are saying that the deerskin suitcase is full of flies. The Angels would not tell her more, explaining that knowing more would jeopardize her Eternal Soul, as well as their own statuses as Angels. They did not want to mess with that!\n\n\n Old Woman Josie added that she thinks the Man in the Tan Jacket is just a salesman of some sort. A fly salesman, she bets, wandering from town to town with polished shoes and a suitcase full of flies.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t stand those fly salesmen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cRinging my doorbell at 3:00 AM, wanting to show me samples, asking for glasses of orange milk!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The Night Vale Daily Journal has announced that, despite its recent cost-cutting measures and mandatory subscription laws, it is facing a huge budget shortfall this year.\n\n\n '
