Episode 6 - The Drawbridge
b'Rabbits are not what they seem to be.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some power outages reported throughout Night Vale in the last couple of hours. If you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing one\xe2\x80\xa6well then you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear me, can you?\n\n\n The Night Vale Municipal Utility Department said that they are still working to determine the cause of the outages, which are roving back and forth across town in a continuous motion, like a great pacing beast. Those whose neighborhoods have been hit by the outages reported the shriek of hawks overhead, and that when the lights came back on, they felt that perhaps they were different people \xe2\x80\x93 their memories and identities were the same as always, but suddenly felt like costumes that didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit exactly.\xc2\xa0As though it all were actually brand new to them. As though they had been switched out with someone who was exactly like them. As though all that was familiar would ever after be strange.\n\n\n Keep some flashlights with spare batteries and a childhood photo album by you tonight, just in case.\n\n\n The revitalization of the Old Town Drawbridge experienced another setback this week, as engineers determined that the furniture upholstery used to construct the bridge towers soaks up water and creates an unstable foundation. This week\xe2\x80\x99s collapse was the third in as many months.\n\n\n Construction crews have tried building the bridge tower base supports from corrugated cardboard, non-dairy creamer, and ceramic bowls. Nothing has worked.\n\n\n Engineers are asking for help in determining how proper bridge towers are made. If you have any tips, please write them on notebook paper and mail them to\n\n\n Bridge Magic, LLC PO Box 616\n\n\n Do not use cursive or long words. Clearly labeled drawings are preferred.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, it\xe2\x80\x99s that time of year again. Time for our annual pledge drive. Sorry to have to do this, but, you know, Night Vale has a lot of community-supported radio, and the thing about community-supported radio\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s supported by listeners like you.\xc2\xa0As well as Guatemala and some teamsters, who are, sometimes, just too generous.\n\n\n Any amount you can give will help us continue our community programming. A dollar, or two, or even plasma.\n\n\n Take WZZZ, our local numbers station, broadcasting from that strange and tall antenna built out back of the Abandoned Gas Station on Oxford Street. Did you know that it broadcasts a monotone female voice reading out seemingly random numbers interspersed with chimes twenty four hours a day, seven days a week? As you can imagine, that kind of work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring in a lot of money \xe2\x80\x93 unless it does.\n\n\n To be honest, here at Night Vale Radio we don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what that station is for, or what master it is serving. But I do know that it is a vital part of this community, and we should pitch in to help it. We welcome your support. Give us a call! We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number; just whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cForsaken Algonquinia'
