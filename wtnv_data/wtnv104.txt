Episode 88 - Things Fall Apart
b'[Sound of phone ringing as heard\nby the person who made the call]\n\n Female phone voice: Citywide\nutility failures continue to haunt us, but not as much as the\nstrangers who do not appear to move.\n\n Welcome to the Night Vale Public\nUtilities Phone Line.\n\n If you\xe2\x80\x99re calling with a water,\npower, gas, phone, or surveillance camera malfunction, please press\n1.\n\n If you just called to chat\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Sound of 1 being pressed]\n\n Night Vale is currently experiencing\ncitywide power outages, as well as polluted water supplies, and\nseveral gas leaks. It\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault, but H.R. says we should\napologize for the inconvenience. Sorry, I guess.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re not experiencing\nthe same thing, though, so maybe you could reciprocate the\nsympathies?\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\n\n Female phone voice:\nThank you.\n\n To\npay your bill, press 1.\n\n To\ncompliment the fine work of the Utilities Department, press 2.\n\n To\nwhine about your personal problems\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not complimenting the fine work of the Utilities Department.\n\n Female phone voice:\nI can repeat that last option, if you need.\n\n To\ncompliment the fine work of the Utilities Department, press 2.\n\n [Extended silence]\n\n Okay,\nfine.\n\n To\nwhine about your personal problems, press 3.\n\n To\nschedule a service technician, press\n\n [Sound of 4 being pressed]\n\n You\npressed 4. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give you an option 4, you just assumed the next\nnumber and then cut me off mid-sentence.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, good God!\n\n Female phone voice:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is this hard for you? Do you need a hug? Do you need me to\nsing you a lullaby and feed you? Here comes the airplane spoon to\nfeed the hungry hungry boy! Vroom!\nMmm, tasty carrots! Feel better now?\n\n Cecil:\nWow, the phone tree is getting snippy!\n\n Female phone voice:\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be rude. I am a person, not a phone tree. This is my job, to\nrecord every possible phrase for every possible person\xe2\x80\x99s possible\nneed. I recorded all of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m a real human, with a body, and needs,\nand a family. And I have a name. I am Maggie Pennebaker. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\n\xe2\x80\x9cdisembodied lady voice\xe2\x80\x9d who will passively ignore your whiny\nentitlement.\n\n Cecil:\nI \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Maggie. Are\xe2\x80\xa6are we speaking live?\n\n Female phone voice\nMaggie Pennebaker: You selected\n\xe2\x80\x9cschedule a service technician.\xe2\x80\x9d Please hold.\n\n Our\nnext available service date is between the hours of:\n\n Male phone voice:\none\n\n Maggie:\nand\n\n Male phone voice:\nfive p.m.\n\n Maggie:\non\n\n Male phone voice:\nSeptember 4th, 2005\n\n Maggie:\nin the\n\n Male phone voice:\ncommon era.\n\n Cecil:\nThat was 11 years ago!\n\n Maggie:\nTo have time explained to you like you were a five year-old, please\nhang up now and give up on ever having realistic expectations.\n\n To\nconfirm this appointment, press 1.\n\n To\nspeak to a customer service representative, press 2.\n\n [Sound of 2 being pressed]\n\n All\noperators are currently\n\n Male phone voice:\nshouldering the immense burden\n\n Maggie:\nof\n\n Male phone voice:\nsocietal displeasure.\n\n Maggie:\nPlease continue to hold. Current wait time is\n\n Male phone voice:\nsuper long.\n\n Cecil:\nAaaagh!\n\n [Sound of \xc2\xa0call disconnecting,\nthen another dialed phone ringing on the line]\n\n Carlos:\nHey, Pooh!\n\n Cecil:\nHey, Bunny. Listen, Carlos? The power is out here at the station. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t even do my show! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get through to the\nUtilities, but they\xe2\x80\x99re slammed with calls.\n\n Carlos:\nOh, I talked to my friend Maggie, who works there. She said her\ncousin has an extra generator we can borrow.\n\n Cecil:\nYou know Maggie?\n\n Carlos:\nYeah! She used to work with me part-time as a lab assistant. Also,\nJosie came by with her friends and dropped off some bottled water.\nEven John Peter has stopped by. You know John Peter, he\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Cecil:\nYes, John Peters, the farmer. I know.\n\n Carlos:\nNo. John Peter,\nremember? The pharmacist. Anyway, he dropped off your prescription\nthis morning.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, well that was nice of him!\n\n Carlos:\nListen, since you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to work today, you should come back\nhome! It\xe2\x80\x99s bad out there, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get killed or\npossessed by one of the strangers\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you do it here with\nme! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make us some lunch, and we can play Cards In Favor Of\nHumanity.\n\n Cecil:\nAw, that sounds great, but I still need to get to the bottom of what\nis going on in this city. Intern Kareem pulled some documents for me\nthat he says I need to read through, and I have some calls to make.\nThe invasion by these strangers is a big story, and even if I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nbroadcast it, I still need to find some way to report it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call\nyou later.\n\n Carlos:\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re so good at your job.\n\n Cecil:\nYou are too, Carlos. Oh, how\xe2\x80\x99s your research going?\n\n Carlos:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been examining some of the places where the strangers have\nbeen spotted. I have a meter that makes squawking sounds sometimes,\nyou know? And I\xe2\x80\x99m uncertain if those last two sentences are related.\nCecil, Be careful. And\xe2\x80\xa6if you see one of the strangers, just get\nout of there quickly, and call me, okay?\n\n Cecil:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve survived one at the station before. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n\n Carlos:\nWell, past performance is not an indicator of future results, but\xe2\x80\xa6I\nlove you.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay. Bye.\n\n [Sound of \xc2\xa0call disconnecting,\nthen another dialed phone ringing on the line]\n\n Sheriff Sam [\xe2\x80\x9cKill\nV. Maim\xe2\x80\x9d by Grimes plays faintly in the background while the\nSheriff is on the phone]: Howdy!\nSheriff Sam.\n\n Cecil:\nSheriff? Hi, this is Cecil Palmer, over at Night Vale Community\nRadio?\n\n Sheriff:\nWhat I just said was off the record. Don\xe2\x80\x99t play it on air.\n\n Cecil:\nYou only said \xe2\x80\x9chowdy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Sheriff:\nNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay. Sheriff, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even on the air right now. No one is listening\nto this call, except the Secret Police, the City Council, the mayor,\nand\xe2\x80\xa6well, some neighborhood espionage clubs, but they have our\ncommunity\xe2\x80\x99s best interests at heart.\n\n Look,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m calling because I wanted to find out what the Secret Police know\nabout the strangers who are showing up all over town. Are the\nstructural failures related to their presence here?\n\n Sheriff:\nNow, by \xe2\x80\x9cstrangers,\xe2\x80\x9d do you mean the foreigners from Desert\nBluffs, who are taking over our beautiful city after they managed to\nrun their own city into the dirt? Or are you referring to the people\nwho don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to move, except for their breathing, who stand and\nstare at seemingly nothing, and who \xe2\x80\x93 without any noticeable motion\n\xe2\x80\x93 suddenly appear much closer, and who cause our citizens to stand\ntrance-like until they\xe2\x80\x99re taken or killed or subsumed or converted\ninto non-moving strangers themselves?\n\n Cecil:\nThe latter.\n\n Sheriff:\nCecil [the Sheriff pronounces it \xe2\x80\x9csess-ill\xe2\x80\x9d throughout\nthe conversation]. There are two\nsinkholes opened up on Route 800. The dam along Night Vale Lake\nbroke. Fortunately our lake is just an empty dust hole, but it still\nbroke wide open. Also, I have a caffeine headache, even though I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t drink caffeine!\n\n Cecil:\nThat just sounds like a headache, then.\n\n Sheriff:\nLook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the media dictating to me what is or is not a\ncaffeine\nheadache! The point is, things are falling apart, but not in the fun\nway \xe2\x80\x93 in the awful\nway!\n\n Cecil:\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a fun\nway?\n\n Sheriff:\nWell yes, like\xe2\x80\xa6during a scheduled earthquake, or ho-ho! Or when the\nlizard people dig new tunnels below old buildings.\n\n Cecil:\n[Laughs]\nOh, oh, of course! Of course. Oh! What about the former Desert Bluffs\nresidents who moved to Night Vale? Are\xe2\x80\xa6are the strangers doing the\nsame to them?\n\n Sheriff:\nWho cares?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I\ncare! The people who know them care! They\xe2\x80\x99re humans,\nSheriff! And as a reporter, I will\nreport that you said that.\n\n Sheriff:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m the sheriff of a secret police force, so, no you won\xe2\x80\x99t. You\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do that at all.\n\n [Awkward\npause]\n\n Ha-ha!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just playing with you! I have a dry sense of humor, you might\nhave missed that. I was\ndelivering a real threat to your life, but in a teasing way. Ha-ha.\nYou definitely won\xe2\x80\x99t\nreport anything I tell you.\n\n Some\nof those Desert Bluffs people we can\xe2\x80\x99t even track. Not all of them\nstayed here, some of them moved away. In our regular interrogations\nand detentions of these non-citizens, we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that a lot of\nthem moved to some other place, which they say feels a bit more like\nhome. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about that, except that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get\nthem out of here. They can set up all the Joyous Congregations of the\nSmiling God that they want some other place!\n\n Just\ntell your listeners that everything is fixed, and everyone is safe.\nThe Sheriff saved the day.\n\n Cecil:\nBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything!\n\n Sheriff:\nGot to go, Cecil! Just got some new calligraphy pens I need to break\nin before the press conference to announce that all is lost.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, it\xe2\x80\x99s Cecil [pronounced\n\xe2\x80\x9csee-sill\xe2\x80\x9d],\nthanks.\n\n [Sound\nof \xc2\xa0call disconnecting, then another dialed phone ringing on the\nline]\n\n Michelle\nNguyen:\nDark Owl Records, please shut up about music before you embarrass\nyourself.\n\n Cecil:\nMichelle? Hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s Cecil. I hate to bother you but I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to\ntrack down Maureen. I heard that you two are friends.\n\n Michelle:\nI only talked about Maureen privately into my audio journal. Did you\nlisten to the monologue I recorded?\n\n Cecil:\nYes, I played it on the air six weeks ago.\n\n Michelle:\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to hear that! That was personal!\n\n Cecil:\nMichelle, you mailed me a cassette with a note that said \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s my\nmonologue to play on your show, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Michelle:\nBut that was me from more than a month ago. I hate\nthat me. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever made mistakes in your youth?\n\n Cecil:\nYes. Many. Michelle, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to Maureen recently, how is she?\n\n Michelle:She\xe2\x80\x99s\nfine. I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s not that into leading an army, or whatever, but\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just a thing she does for a living. I sell records, you talk on\nthe radio, Maureen leads the army of unmoving strangers.\n\n Cecil:\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s the leader\nof the strangers?\n\n Michelle:\nOr whatever. Maureen was sweet, and let me see one of the strangers\nup close. They smell like compost, and are all gray, and they make\nyou feel cold. They\xe2\x80\x99re really beautiful, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll devour your soul\nand turn you into one of them. Maureen says it\xe2\x80\x99s super painful when\nthey do that, and the transformation is for forever. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\ncan only stand and breathe, and not really move, because they\xe2\x80\x99re in\nso much pain for so long, trapped in immortal bodies.\n\n It\nwas cool. Kind of\ncool. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Will you hate me if I like something?\n\n Cecil:\nMichelle, how did you get up close to one without being devoured?\n\n Michelle:\nMaureen said she\xe2\x80\x99d keep me safe from them, because we\xe2\x80\x99re each others\xe2\x80\x99\nonly friends. Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6kind person. She does like country music,\nbut I think friendship is sometimes about compromise. If it means\ngetting to be around her, I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly happy covering my ears and\nhumming the Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Burgers theme.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat about the boy in the hoodie, who hangs out with Maureen?\n\n Michelle:\nChad? Chad\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I guess. He\xe2\x80\x99s just Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s boss, though. She has\nto hang around him a bunch and watch his evil dog. It\xe2\x80\x99s just work,\nyou know?\n\n Cecil:\nMichelle, I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Michelle:\nCecil? Music sometimes calms me. You want to hear a song I really\nlike?\n\n Cecil:\nSure.\n\n Michelle:\nOkay, here you go.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPalestine\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Sam Baker,\nfeaturing Carrie Elkin]\n\n Cecil:\nThat was a wonderful song, Michelle!\n\n Michelle:\nAre you still talking about that song I started playing five\nminutes\nago? I\xe2\x80\x99ve moved on from that. Glad you like oldies so much.\n\n Anyway,\nMaureen\xe2\x80\x99s new phone number is Old Town-57614.\n\n Cecil:\nThanks, Michelle.\n\n [Sound\nof \xc2\xa0call disconnecting, then another dialed phone ringing on the\nline]\n\n Maureen:\nHi, this is Maureen. I am probably at work, or asleep, or somewhere\nelse. Somewhere listening to the sound of the moon slowly trying to\npeel off our oceans with its gravity, pulling its weak little chalky\nspeck of a body, grabbing this blue giant and tearing away at its\nwatery skin. A futile fight. A spinning battle of large and small.\nAnd in the sky you can hear the whirling of the battling siblings.\n\n Or\nmaybe I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take your call. Or maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m dead. Or\nmaybe you\xe2\x80\x99re\ndead, and this is the voicemail you get when you die.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHi,\nMaureen here, sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re dead! For some reason, I\xe2\x80\x99m the one person\nyou wanted to call the moment you left behind your short life, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not even here to take it. So sorry, newly-dead person! Make sure\nyou leave a phone number where I can reach you, because I certainly\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to call dead people on the phone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Or\nmaybe I lost my phone, and it\xe2\x80\x99s in my car, or under a pillow, or I\nleft it in a movie theater, or a raccoon ate it.\n\n Maybe\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a raccoon somewhere in the brush, or in a trash can behind a\nhouse, walking with a limp because it just ate a phone. A rectangle\nof glass, and metal, and electronics, that\xe2\x80\x99s a quarter of the length\nof the raccoon\xe2\x80\x99s body, and now that phone is inside the raccoon\xe2\x80\x99s\nguts, stretching its tiny tummy impossibly long, pressing against the\nmasked Procyon\xe2\x80\x99s little heart and lungs as it walks tenderly to one\nside to alleviate the discomfort of such an intrusive foreign object.\n\n The\nraccoon \xe2\x80\x93 and\xe2\x80\xa6this is kind of cute, kind of sad to think about \xe2\x80\x93\nwalks diagonally, all the while emitting a little \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x99\xab\ndoo-de-lee-doo-ooo, doo-de-lee-dooooo, doo-de-lee-doo \xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x80\x9d\nringtone, all muffled from within its quivering torso, and\nquestioning its \xe2\x80\x9ceat everything it can find\xe2\x80\x9d dogma, and thinking\nperhaps to just limit that life philosophy to trash cans.\n\n Of\ncourse, I bet people throw away phones all the time, so that\xe2\x80\x99s\nprobably not a big help\xe2\x80\xa6although in my case, I\xe2\x80\x99m positive I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\ndo that because my job is too important to just throw my phone away.\nToo, too important. Too many evil beings to manage. Too fragile a\nportal into another dimension, a dimension which is probably Hell?\nIDK. I\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m not a religious studies major, although if I were, I bet\nI would have graduated by now.\n\n I\nmean, so much can go wrong if I lost my phone. Like, no one could get\na hold of me to help me fix it. Which is not to say I know how to fix\nan inter-dimensional portal between Hell and this world, but just\nthat I could be a person to be like \xe2\x80\x9cOh no! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear the\nportal is malfunctioning! Let me panic a little bit and make some\nphone calls to feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re all doing something about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthat would be helpful, because sympathy is critical to good teamwork,\nand if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about your job, you\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna make anything\nof yourself.\n\n I\nam! I am making something of myself! Just sculpting away! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\nclump of Maureen, let\xe2\x80\x99s work it with it with these hands. Yeah, this\nis looking great! This is a really nice Maureen here, all ready to be\nput in a fire, cooled, painted, and set upon an alabaster pedestal in\nthe foyer.\n\n So\nleave me a message and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.\n\n [Answering\nmachine beeps]\n\n Cecil:\nMaureen! I finally figured it out. Chad Bowinger! That boy I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\nyou with! He used to intern here, just like you! He went to report a\nstory on that used sporting goods store that we thought was a front\nfor the World Government, and never came back out. I guess it was\nsomething much worse he found in that shady old building.\n\n Now\nthe two of you have a really successful startup. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of our\ninternship program here at the station. I \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m also proud of you\nfor becoming a professional. You\xe2\x80\x99re leading an army,\nMaureen, that\xe2\x80\x99s very impressive! Much more so than filing papers,\nfetching me lunch, and updating my erotic fan fiction blog. It sounds\nlike a great job with good benefits. It\xe2\x80\x99s, uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough job\nmarket for you young people these days. Lots of changing technologies\nmaking old jobs like print journalism, cardiology, and computer\nprogramming obsolete. Plus, all these new people moving here from\nDesert Bluffs? Kudos to you, Maureen!\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s\nmy question, though, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one. So, Carlos, my\nboyfriend. Earlier, when I talked to him, I forgot to say \xe2\x80\x9cI love\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d at the end of the call. I was\xe2\x80\xa6I was preoccupied. No \xe2\x80\x93 no\nbig deal. My love was implicit in the way was talked to each other.\nLove needn\xe2\x80\x99t be verbalized when it exists in intuition and physical\ncontact. He knows I love him.\n\n But\npart of me wonders\xe2\x80\xa6what if one of those rare times I forgot to hug\nhim goodbye, or failed to say \xe2\x80\x9cI love you,\xe2\x80\x9d turns out to be the\nlast time I have that chance? Lots can go wrong in an indifferent\nuniverse.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsee him in a couple of hours, right? I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Carlos later. Right,\nMaureen?\n\n Please\ncall me back. I want to talk more about what you and Chad are doing\nto my town. I\xe2\x80\xa6oh. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting another call from an unknown number.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m hoping this is the Sheriff. Call me back.\n\n Hello?\n\n [Unidentifiable\nsound]\n\n Hello?\n\n [Unidentifiable\nsound]\n\n Who\nis this?\n\n [Muffled\nsounds that may be muffled screams, or possibly sounds that an evil\ndog might make \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear which]\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Want to feel old? People born in 2014 have already graduated\ncollege, don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a trombone is, and are all named after\ngourds.'
