Episode 77 - A Stranger
b'When a window closes, so does a door.\nSo do all the other doors and\nwindows. The house is alive, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know you, and it is\nscared.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s top\nstory: there\xe2\x80\x99s a strange person standing in the lobby of our radio\nstation. This person is standing still, in front of the reception\ncounter. Our receptionist, Lance, keeps asking the stranger if they\nneed anything, or if they are here to see anyone. The stranger has\nnot moved. Lance said that he never saw the stranger enter. He looked\nup, and the stranger was just there, about eight feet away from\nLance\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\n\n The stranger has\neyes that are darker than some people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but lighter than other\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. The same could be said about the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hair,\nteeth, clothing, lips, and skin.\n\n The stranger\nstands with their arms at their side, weight distributed evenly\nacross the hips \xe2\x80\x93 a rigid but casual stance. The stranger can be\nseen breathing. It is hard to say exactly what the stranger is\nlooking at. It is even harder to say what the stranger wants.\n\n Lance told me he\nwould update me on the stranger, and I will do the same for you,\nlisteners.\n\n Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for\nanother Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n Did you know that\nover 70% of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface is water? It\xe2\x80\x99s true! Scientists\nbelieve that the other 30% is some kind of animal hide. Their data\nshows that the world\xe2\x80\x99s continents comprise the leathery back of a\nslow-moving ocean beast. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically what kind of\nbeast, but scientists hope that it\xe2\x80\x99s cute.\n\n Or, at minimum,\nnon-venomous and fairly easy to take care of.\n\n Scientists are\nhoping they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about all of this, but given that they\xe2\x80\x99re\nscientists, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much impossible.\n\n Lest the beast\nreveal its true nature, please walk gently and speak softly so as not\nto alert it to your presence.\n\n This has been\nChildren\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n Mayor Dana\nCardinal announced this morning that she has been in touch with\nneighboring city Desert Bluffs.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\na disgusting town with terrible people, and we will no longer speak\nof them,\xe2\x80\x9d she would have announced, if she were me. But, here is\nwhat she actually said:\n\n Dana: What\ndoes it mean to be a good neighbor, Night Vale? Is it enough that we\nintroduce ourselves? That we say hello? That we avoid eye contact and\nhave sturdy doors and call centers for reporting suspicious activity?\nHow far out does neighborliness extend?\n\n Because I have\ntapped my friend\xe2\x80\x99s phones, and am using trained birds to record all\nof their activities, does that make me a kind person? A neighborly\nperson?\n\n It does.\n\n But\nwhat about beyond what we can see? Who\nwe can see? How far does our kindness extend? To the limits of our\ncity? To the limits of our eyesight? To the end of our block? To the\ntips of our noses?\n\n People of Night\nVale, we have a chance to help a neighbor in need. I have been\napproached by our friends to the north\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n W\xe2\x80\x93\nwait, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m being told it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nto the north. To the east.\nOh\xe2\x80\xa6which direction are they, then? What?\nIt changes? Really?\n\n Okay.\n\n Shh. Shhhh!\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6By our nearby\nfriends in this desert.\n\n Due to financial\nhardships, the people of Desert Bluffs are in need. We are all in\nthis together, Night Vale. Sickness can spread, whether that sickness\nis viral or economic. We must not ignore our neighbors, our friends.\n\n Today I have\nasked the City Council to negotiate a low-interest loan to Desert\nBluffs, our proximate civic family. I think they would do the same\nfor us.\n\n [Dana starts sounding as if she is\nchewing something as she speaks]\n\n If I sound\npassionate, it is because my heart is full of blood. If I sound\nboisterous, it is because my lungs are full of words. If I sound like\nI am eating, it\xe2\x80\x99s because my mouth is full of dirt. Sometimes I chew\non dirt when I\xe2\x80\x99m anxious, or when I\xe2\x80\x99m happy, or when I\xe2\x80\x99m talking. I\nlike chewing on dirt.\n\n [Dana returns to regular speech,\nher mouth apparently no longer full]\n\n I hope you will\nsupport your neighbors in whatever direction they live. I hope you\nwill support my decision as mayor.\n\n Good day, Night\nVale.\n\n Cecil:\nMayor Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s deputy, Trish Hidge, said there would be no\nquestions. She then picked the mayor up into her arms, pulled her\ncloak across their huddled bodies, and ran through the crowd, bowling\nover journalists and onlookers, and some random jogger who thinks\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s better than everyone else because he exercises publicly.\n\n The City Council\nhas already registered their opposition to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan to help\nDesert Bluffs. The City Council issued their own statement, which was\nto stomp into their room, slam the door, and play Rihanna very\nloudly.\n\n I\nhave to say, I agree\nwith the City Council on this issue, listeners. I understand Mayor\nCardinal\xe2\x80\x99s concern about Desert Bluffs\xe2\x80\x99 struggling economy, and she\nis a very kind and sympathetic person. But, as the poet Robert Frost\nonce said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood fences make good neighbors. Really strong\nfences. With razor wire and turrets. Keep those neighbors out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And Frost was\nright.\n\n I support Dana on\nmost issues, but I say, save your sympathy for your own town\xe2\x80\x99s\npeople.\n\n An update on the\nstranger standing in our lobby:\n\n The\nstranger is still\nstanding in our lobby. Lance approached them, but grew scared. The\nstranger stood so still that it became impossible to derive context\nfrom motion or activity. Any sound or movement the stranger might\nmake would be completely divorced of linear narrative or conventional\nmeaning. At any moment the stranger could suddenly lurch, or shriek,\nwithout apparent cause. Thus the clenching terror Lance felt as he\nneared the person in the lobby.\n\n Lance mentioned\nhe could hear breathing. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t labored, but it also wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quiet.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a\nperson breathing,\xe2\x80\x9d Lance confirmed.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nnot entirely sure how Lance confirmed that. I\xe2\x80\x99m also not entirely\nsure how anyone can confirm anything,\nso let\xe2\x80\x99s just go with what Lance says.\n\n Listeners, if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to call into the station I apologize, as Lance is\ntoo frozen in fear to do much of anything. He thinks he sees the\nstranger moving, but he also thinks he does not. He is desperate for\nsome explanation of this person\xe2\x80\x99s presence in our lobby, but he has\nreceived none.\n\n Lance is now\ncrying, but without tears.\n\n He is screaming,\nbut without sound.\n\n He wants so gain\nthe courage to touch the stranger, to hit the stranger, to punch and\npunch and kick and claw at the stranger. He wants to feel the relief,\na release from the madness of mystery. He would rather experience\nactual pain than wait any longer in anticipation of the unknown.\n\n Lance wants to\nsigh, but he cannot. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time he exhaled. He\nis not sure of what is real. So he is sorry if you keep getting our\nvoicemail here at the station. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a rough day.\n\n More on this\nsoon. But first, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at this week\xe2\x80\x99s Community Calendar.\n\n Thursday\nafternoon, there is a free ice cream social for all members of the\nIlluminati. If you are Illuminati, please go to the secret\nunderground bunker. There will be ice cream, streamers, and, of\ncourse, a bocce ball tournament. If you are not\nIlluminati, please disregard this notice. Maybe just stock up on some\nbottled water and bullets, and hope for the best.\n\n Friday night,\nDark Owl Records will host a 90s fashion night. Everyone is required\nto non-ironically wear t-shirts and hats from the 1990s, which were\noriginally ironically worn t-shirts and hats from the 1970s. Owner\nMichelle Nguyen asked that everyone be as sincere as they can be.\nIrony will not be tolerated, only studied, museum-like, on puffy\ntruck hats with clever witticisms like \xe2\x80\x9cHEY,\nBEER!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI LIKE HIGHWAY\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9cDOG,\xe2\x80\x9d along\nwith airbrushed pictures of rattlesnakes, eagles, hot glue guns, and\nscreen doors.\n\n Nguyen asked that\nI not invite the public to this event.\n\n Oh.\n\n Oooohhhhhhhhhh\xe2\x80\xa6I\nshould have read the whole press release before reading that.\n\n And\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\xa6just\nreceived a\xe2\x80\xa6new press release from Dark Owl owner Michelle\nNguyen, announcing that the event has been canceled because people\nknow about it.\n\n [Whispers]\nSorry, Michelle!\n\n On Saturday,\nStrexCorp \xe2\x80\x93 formerly a Desert Bluffs corporation and now a Night\nVale business, owned and operated by beings who are definitely not\nangels \xe2\x80\x93 will be the headline sponsor of a new program called \xe2\x80\x9cFree\nOpera Day,\xe2\x80\x9d a weekly community event where anyone can hear opera at\nno cost. In fact, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to go to the New Old Opera\nHouse to hear it! Opera will be broadcast from the municipal\nloudspeakers, which are located on every residential block in the\ncity, and within most residential homes.\n\n On Sunday, the\nNight Vale Opera will be running their most popular weekly program,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpera Free Day,\xe2\x80\x9d where citizens are relieved of all opera for 24\nhours. No one is allowed to play any opera at all. Armed soldiers\nfrom a private armed soldier corporation will walk the streets making\nsure no one is playing any opera.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\nopera?\xe2\x80\x9d one armed soldier will ask the others.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanother will reply.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCould that\nbe opera?\xe2\x80\x9d another will ask.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go check\nit out,\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ll all say, lifting their rifles and approaching what\nwill appear to be an automated car wash.\n\n Monday morning\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter. Nothing ever did. Be silent, and look upward\nto the sky as if it had your answers. It does not. The sky is as dumb\nas rocks. Really dumb. You\xe2\x80\x99ll figure that out early Monday\nmorning, as you passively choose to experience the day in spite of\nits pointlessness, mumbling, \xe2\x80\x9cnaught else remains to do,\xe2\x80\x9d while\nbrushing your teeth.\n\n And now a word\nfrom our sponsor.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is\nsponsored by\xe2\x80\xa6well, it\xe2\x80\x99s sponsored by\xe2\x80\xa6your mom.\n\n She\xe2\x80\x99s really\nnice, and she mailed us a ten dollar bill to sponsor this show.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s well below our usual advertising rate here at the station, but\nyour mom was just the sweetest!\n\n She also wrote a\nletter saying that she hopes you\xe2\x80\x99re having a fun time listening to\nthe show, she knows it\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite radio program (aww!),\nand wants you to know that she loves you very much (awwwwww!).\n\n Your mom also\nwants to know if you\xe2\x80\x99re still seeing that boy. He\xe2\x80\x99s bad news,\nand she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like his tattoos. Not that people with tattoos are\nbad, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what she\xe2\x80\x99s saying, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\nthink his skin will look like when he\xe2\x80\x99s 60?\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\nyou think anyone\xe2\x80\x99s skin will look like when they\xe2\x80\x99re 60?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid repeatedly.\n\n She asked several\nquiet sad questions about the process of aging. Then she said she\ncares for you no matter what. She just wants you to be happy.\n\n This message has\nbeen brought to you by your mom.\n\n Good news,\nlisteners! I\xe2\x80\x99ve just learned that the stranger standing in our lobby\nhas finally moved. Unfortunately, the stranger has begun walking\nslowly toward Lance. The stranger raised one arm, imperceptibly at\nfirst, but by the time the hand was nearly brushing Lance\xe2\x80\x99s neck,\nLance realized it and leapt out of the way.\n\n Lance is\ncurrently standing behind his rolling chair, watching closely for the\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s next move, even though the stranger is moving so slowly as\nto appear motionless.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s like the old\nadage about the frog and the frying pan? I mean, they say if you put\na frog in a frying pan and then turn up the heat very gradually, then\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a sociopath who takes pleasure in the torture of innocent\nanimals. Go easy on the frogs, OK? They\xe2\x80\x99re adorable, and ecologically\nimportant, but also easy to trick into dying.\n\n [Sound of a\ndistant scream]\n\n [*Gasp*]\nOh my goodness! Lance!\n\n Listeners, I must\ncheck on my colleague, uh, but first, I must take you to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cMeet\nYou at the Gate\xe2\x80\x9d by Jayne\nTrimble]\n\n Listeners, we\nfound Lance.\n\n He was curled\ninto a dark corner of the storage closet, his eyes dull, his jaw\nslack, his gray maw unnaturally long.\n\n The stranger who\nhad stood so quietly, so nearly still in the lobby before, is now\nnowhere to be seen. Likely, they are still in this very building,\nready to show themselves again at any moment.\n\n I bent down, and\ntook Lance\xe2\x80\x99s hand. He was always a good receptionist.\n\n Well\xe2\x80\xa6he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthat great. I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no national receptionist ranking\nsystem, how am I supposed to know? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done it myself. Uh, he\ncould have been a receptionist savant, for all I know about the\nfield.\n\n But Lance was a\ngood man. He loved movies. He always dreamed of moving to Hollywood\nand becoming a makeup artist for major motion pictures. He loved\ndoing makeup. But it was a dream deferred as he could never figure\nout where Hollywood was, or how you were supposed to get there. Most\nairlines and bus drivers would stare blankly at him when he tried to\nbuy a ticket. It\xe2\x80\x99s not on any map I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible Lance\njust invented it to take his mind off the tedium of daily life.\n\n Either way, his\nmakeup skills came in handy, as he did himself up just like that poor\ngirl in the closet from his favorite documentary, The Ring. Plaid\nskirt and white shirt, long hair, and a grotesque corpse face. He\nreally nailed it!\n\n I told him good\njob, he climbed out of the storage room and said thanks. I told him\none day, someone will find out where Hollywood is, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll go there\nand be a super-famous makeup artist.\n\n He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\nanything. We stood in silence for several minutes.\n\n Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a\ncontinuing education class at the community college about the art of\nconversation. They said every good conversationalist should try to\nfind five to seven straight minutes of no speaking, in order to let\nothers talk. Lance is taking that same class, so we both gave\nthe other person room to speak for those long silent minutes.\n\n Finally, our\nintern Kate entered and told us her roommate called to say there\xe2\x80\x99s a\nstranger standing just outside their apartment door. The stranger\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t moving, or speaking, and won\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\n\n Kate said she\nneeded to take off early to deal with this. She said this several\ntimes, each iteration slightly louder, slightly more strained.\n\n Have a great rest\nof your day, Kate!\n\n Oh, Lance has\nreturned to his work, feeling better. I asked him to check for missed\ncalls, as the light for the voicemail was rapidly blinking to\nindicate it was full. We apparently received dozens of calls\nfrom Night Vale residents reporting strangers \xe2\x80\x93 standing, silent,\nand unmoving \xe2\x80\x93 in their homes, or sitting in the back seats of\ntheir cars. A few residents were in their beds in the middle of the\nnight when they turned and found a stranger there, lying beside them,\nempty eyes staring at nothing. Not moving.\n\n Listeners, maybe\ntake a moment to check outside your front door. Check for a silent\nstrange face in your window, or just around the corner at the end of\na hallway. Perhaps take an agonizing look into your shower. Just in\ncase. Make sure there is no one there.\n\n If there is,\nwell, be patient. They move pretty slowly, it turns out.\n\n You know what?\nMaybe hide until the stranger leaves. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine\xe2\x80\xa6but maybe hide.\nOr run away. Maybe just huddle down, close your eyes, and hope one\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t near you right now.\n\n Stay tuned next\nfor the sound of human breathing. Which is probably just your own\nbreathing\xe2\x80\xa6probably.\n\n As always,\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a single issue voter. If the candidate is not a baby polar bear,\nI straight up cannot support them.'
