Bonus Episode 4 - Pamela Winchell
b'Cecil:\nIn response to the \xe2\x80\x9cmurderer on the loose\xe2\x80\x9d situation, Mayor Dana\nCardinal has sent her official Night Vale Director of Emergency Press\nConferences to issue an emergency press conference. Unfortunately,\nthe Press Conference Gazebo is currently on fire\xe2\x80\xa6due to routine\nmaintenance. So this press conference will be held right here in our\nstudio. Please welcome former mayor Pamela Winchell.\n\n Pamela Winchell:\nHello, members of the press corps. Hello, people of the public.\nHello, visiting dignitaries, wandering spirits, and hidden royalty\ndisguised as local farmers due to troubles in their home country.\n\n I\nwould like to start this emergency press conference with a joke.\n\n OK.\nSo.\n\n What\ndid the dog say to the bartender?\n\n Crowd:\nWhat?\n\n Pamela:\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath is just a tone of soil \xe2\x80\x93 but then, my friend, so is life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n [Pamela laughs, joined by Cecil \xe2\x80\x93\nwho laughs longer than Pamela does]\n\n Hold\nany laughter for the end of the presentation, please!\n\n Citizens,\nthere is a murderer among us, striking at us from the shadows!\n\n Yeah,\nso what? This morning, my wrist was sore! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why! I woke\nup, and it was sore! Does anyone know why? If you know why, please\nnotify a town official. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a joint thing.\n\n Maybe\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll all make it through today. Maybe you won\xe2\x80\x99t. I mean, what am I,\nsome kind of expert on you?\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink. Well, I might be.\nYou know, it has been\na long time since college, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what it was that I\nstudied. I mean\xe2\x80\xa6plants? Are plants a thing?\n\n Cecil:\nPure fiction.\n\n Pamela:\nOK, not that then.\n\n It is\nimportant, in times of emergency, to remain calm. This won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you\nsafe. Whatever was going to happen to you, will happen to you anyway.\nBut you will be less irritating to those around you as it happens. I\nmean, people usually make such a fuss and a bunch of noise when in\nmortal danger, and some of us are trying to read right now, thank\nyou!\n\n Maybe\nthe reading is why my wrist is sore! Ah! I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I should have\nstretched more before doing something that takes this much hard\nphysical labor.\n\n Mayor\nCardinal asked me to come to speak to you. I have come to tentatively\nrespect Mayor Cardinal, although I maintain a slight suspicion that\nshe may be a number of super-sentient lizards in a meat costume. I\nhave the same suspicion toward all people, including myself.\n\n Anyway,\nMayor Cardinal asked me to relay some important emergency info to all\nof you, so here it is:\n\n On the\nedge of the known universe is a campfire, and around it are three\nfigures, indistinct and huddling \xe2\x80\x93 refugees from the universe\nbefore our own. They will never be able to return home. And,\nmetaphorically, neither will any of us. We are all, metaphorically,\nhuddled around a campfire at the edge of the known universe. But in\nliteral terms, only those three figures are. And no one knows their\nnames. And no one ever will.\n\n The\nNight Vale municipal government hopes that this emergency information\nwas helpful to you. As always, if you are in need of assistance,\nplease don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. Thank you, Cecil, I will now step into the\ncircle I drew in the sand with my big toe and vanish in a flash of\ngreen smoke.\n\n Cecil:\nOh. Well, thank you very much!\n\n Annnnnnnnd\nyup! There she goes, flash of green smoke. Looks like she still has a\nlittle bit of that mayoral power left inside her.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Dodge Ram. Good\ncar. Even better advice.'
