Episode 61 - BRINY DEPTHS
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\nunder your bed. Nothing in your closet. Nothing waiting in the hall.\nYou are surrounded by nothing. You cannot escape it.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\n\n I have received\nseveral urgent Facebook messages and Twitter DMs from a Vague, Yet\nMenacing, Government Agency, asking me to deliver the following\nmessage:\n\n BRINY DEPTHS\n\n They said that there\nwas nothing secret or important about the message, and it was\ncertainly not related to any ongoing deep undercover operations, that\nthey can only communicate with using code words subtly buried in\nlocal radio broadcasts.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nanything crazy like that,\xe2\x80\x9d they just think it would be \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d\nto hear me say:\n\n BRINY DEPTHS\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDo your deepest,\nsmoothest voice,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cReally sell it. Really give it your\nall. It would make us so\nhappy! Please, it\xe2\x80\x99s our birthday! Oh! Did we not mention it\xe2\x80\x99s totally\nour birthday? All right, in your best voice, say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n BRINY\nDEPTHS\n\n Well,\nthere you go, Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency! Happy birthday!\n\n The\nFaceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, and Hiram\nMcDaniels, who is literally a five-headed dragon \xe2\x80\x93 both former\ncandidates for the mayoral role now filled by Dana Cardinal \xe2\x80\x93 were\nseen muttering together in a booth at the Moonlite All-Nite Diner.\n\n Or, Hiram was seen. No one has ever actually seen the Faceless Old\nWoman, but we\xc2\xa0all\nknow that she is there.\n\n When\nreached for comment, by a nosy person sitting in the booth next to\nthem, Hiram explained that they were just chatting, and were not\ninvolved in any sort of plans or schemes at all. He then held a\nconversation with himself about this matter, each head providing a\ndifferent viewpoint in five different voices, the gist of which was\nthat no, they were not planning anything.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d the Faceless Old Woman scratched with what seemed to be a\nlong, jagged fingernail into the sole of my shoe this morning.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s ludicrous,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested, with a flickering shadow in\nthe corner of my eye as I walked to work. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would never,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe whispered from behind me, just now.\n\n Moving\non, another installment of what I imagine is our listeners\xe2\x80\x99 favorite\nsegment: Cooking Stuff with Earl Harlan.\n\n As\nthe name implies, we have my childhood friend and current sous chef\nat Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s hottest restaurant, Tourniquet, with us here in the\nstudio. Earl?\n\n Earl:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s me, yes.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, Earl, just a few months ago you shows us how to cook tiramisu.\nAnd that was delightful.\n\n Earl:\nOh, please don\xe2\x80\x99t cook that recipe. It is extraordinarily poisonous.\n\n Cecil:\nHa-ha-ha! Oh, Earl. You\xe2\x80\x99re very funny.\n\n Earl:\nIt will kill you,\nCecil. It is actually\npoisonous. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cook that.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, tell our listeners (and me, of course) what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been up to\nsince we last spoke.\n\n Earl:\nOh, mostly, um, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working. Mostly living. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending\ntime with my son. Trying to remember when I had a son. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\ntrying to understand the flow of my life, and how I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\ngoing from being 19 to the middle-aged adult I am now. I was 19 for\nso long!\n\n Cecil:\nWell, sure! That sounds like fun. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, lately I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\ngetting into crosswords. Just can\xe2\x80\x99t stop doing them. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even\nfeel like it\xe2\x80\x99s me doing them, like it\xe2\x80\x99s someone else compelling\nme to do them. Sometimes I pick up a crossword I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen\nbefore, only to find it\xe2\x80\x99s been completely filled in with my own\nhandwriting.\n\n Ha\n\xe2\x80\x93 well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99ve both been up to such fun things.\n\n Earl:\nCecil, think. What year were you born?\n\n Cecil:\nSo, what are we cooking up today, Earl?\n\n Earl:\nOh, OK. Well, today we are making pulled pork.\n\n Cecil:\nOooh, that sounds yummy!\n\n Earl:\nIt is! Pulled pork could not be simpler to make. To start off with,\nyou will need to kill a pig. You will need to find a living pig, and\nkill that pig. You will probably need to hold down the pig. The pig\nwill struggle. There will be blood, and pain. Some of that pain will\nbe physical. The pig will want to live, but you will need to make it\ndie. That pig will need to die.\n\n Cecil:\nSure.\n\n Earl:\nThen, you will need to dismember the pig. The pig will be a whole\nbeing, but you will not be able to eat it like that. So you will need\nto take it apart. There will be knives, and hacking. The skin will\nhave to go. Peel back that skin and take the muscles and subcutaneous\nfat which is the part you will consume. Leave the bones and skin\nbehind to rot.\n\n Cecil:\nMmmmmmmm!\n\n Earl:\nThen\xe2\x80\xa6you slow-cook it with some vinegar, some sugar, and some chili.\nPut it on a bun, and there ya go! Pulled pork!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to try that. It seems so easy! I\xe2\x80\x99ll just use\none of the pigs I have at home.\n\n Earl:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I seem down at all, Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going through a\nlot.\n\n Cecil:\nOh. Well, I understand. This has been a difficult time for me too.\nCarlos is away, and\xe2\x80\xa6we talk regularly, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as the\nphysical presence of someone you love, you know?\n\n Earl:\nI know. I know. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what we do when we have someone special\nenough to merit special effort. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you for working through\nthis.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you for dealing with how weird time is. Oh! And for\nraising a son\xe2\x80\xa6somehow. Uh, what is your son\xe2\x80\x99s name?\n\n Earl:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish I knew.\n\n Cecil:\nWell\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s been great catching up, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again soon, Earl!\n\n I\nreceived another flurry of messages from a Vague, Yet Menacing,\nGovernment Agency, saying that\xe2\x80\xa6well, \xe2\x80\x9cthanks for saying those\nwords for us, that was great of you, but it looks like maybe it\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t work?\xe2\x80\x9d they rhetorically asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNot important,\xe2\x80\x9d they\nreplied to themselves.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAs\nwe said, that was certainly not\na code word for an undercover agent, who apparently wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listening\nto the radio when they were supposed to be, which is (by the way)\ntheir only job, and\ntheir duty, and their life\xe2\x80\x99s mission to be listening to instructions\nfrom headquarters, so\xe2\x80\xa6no biggie. But maybe, just do something as\nsimple as listen to the radio at the time we tell you to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway,\nnone of that is important,\xe2\x80\x9d the Agency continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is\nno particular reason we\xe2\x80\x99re asking you, but\xe2\x80\xa6could you say \xe2\x80\x9cBRINY\nDEPTHS\xe2\x80\x9d again? It\xe2\x80\x99s for a friend\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. It\xe2\x80\x99s also our friend\xe2\x80\x99s\nbirthday, we forgot to mention that. Please say it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6OK.\nHere goes.\n\n BRINY\nDEPTHS\n\n Happy\nbirthday to your friend! I hope you enjoyed that, but\xe2\x80\xa6I really\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t keep interrupting my broadcast with this stuff.\n\n Little\nLeague coach Betty Lucero is reporting that there are strange\ngoings-on near the haunted baseball diamond her team uses for\npractices and league games. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no no, no, I know,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s haunted,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI get that.\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to explain that\nto me. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there is other\nweird stuff going on beside the usual ghosts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\nwent on to describe anguished howls coming from a neighborhood\nnearby, and a red glow at night that made her skin feel loose and\nitchy when she looked directly at it. She also said that the baseball\ndiamond has started to smell of rotten eggs, which is a detriment to\nher team\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\n\n As\nwe spoke, an apparition of a gray-skinned young woman in a tattered\ndress appeared hovering on the baseline between second and third. I\nmay\nhave yelped a little\xe2\x80\xa6maybe scrambled backwards a bit, but Coach\nLucero laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just Lucia, our third base\ncoach. She died in 1843. Say hi, Lucia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nyoung woman flickered out of view, then reappeared suddenly inches\nfrom my face, her pupil-less eyes staring directly into mine. I\nresponded in a professional and calm manner, and Coach Lucero laughed\nfor unrelated reasons, not anything to do with how I may have\nreacted, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our Lucia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\nthen went on to say that she had a bad feeling about the weird\ngoings-on near the baseball field, and she probably said some other\nthings, but I was running away, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear her super well.\n\n Oh,\nlisteners! This is exciting. I received mail today! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\nmail was still being delivered \xe2\x80\x93 not after what happened at the\nPost Office \xe2\x80\x93 but here it is! An envelope addressed to one Cecil\nPalmer in neat handwriting, with the address of the station right\nunderneath. If you\nwant to send us any mail, since apparently that is a thing which\nexists and is working now, our address is\n\n [Perhaps the sound of ocean waves and birds played at 8kbps,\nfollowed by what sounds to me like three blows on a party horn, then a few moments of\nambient crowd noise]\n\n Night\nVale, \n\n\n [Possibly\nthe sound of an RC car being driven around at high speed on bumpy ground and played\nback at 4kbps? Is 4kbps even a thing?]\n\n Please\ndo send stuff in. It\xe2\x80\x99s always nice to hear from fans.\n\n But,\nback to this envelope. Maybe this is silly, but I waited to open it\nuntil I was on the air. It seemed more fun if we could find out\ntogether what was inside. I\xe2\x80\x99m, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m opening it now\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Sound\nof envelope being torn open]\n\n And\nhere we go. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6oh.\n\n Huh.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\na greeting card! It says, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks so much\xe2\x80\x9d on the front, and it\nhas a picture of a cat playing with a ball of yarn, well that\xe2\x80\x99s just\nthe cutest! Although, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why someone sent me this card.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m opening it\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Oh!\nOh\xe2\x80\xa6 oh. A photo fell out. Oh\xe2\x80\xa6dang it! It fell behind the desk.\nUm, the inside of the card just has the words \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for what\nyou did\xe2\x80\x9d printed, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s signed \xe2\x80\x9cErika,\xe2\x80\x9d over and over\nin multiple handwritings. Huh. Let me\xe2\x80\xa6let me try to grab that\nphoto.\n\n Ummmmm,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to crawl under the desk. While I do that, here\xe2\x80\x99s a\nword from our sponsors.\n\n [Sounds\nof Cecil rustling around]\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99\nbroadcast is sponsored by Kobe beef.\n\n\nKobe\nbeef! [Chime] The\nbeef that makes you fresh!\n\n\n All\nright, listeners, I got the photo. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s a photo of\xe2\x80\xa6me,\nat City Hall\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m fighting off a pack of antiques in front of the\nmayor\xe2\x80\x99s door, but\xe2\x80\xa6that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me! Intern Hector did that, last\nmonth. He came back with that bite? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember ever leaving my\ndesk when the antiques attacked our mayor. What\xe2\x80\xa6what is this photo?\nIt must be fake.\n\n It\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look\nfake.\n\n No.\nIt must be fake. Right? Why would I not remember saving the mayor?\n\n More\non this later, as I face my fragile self and try to understand my own\nreality.\n\n OK,\nnow. This is getting out of hand. The Vague, Yet Menacing, Government\nAgency sent me a Snapchat and several anonymous asks on Tumblr,\nsaying that they were happy about me doing that whole \xe2\x80\x9cbroadcasting\ntheir secret codeword\xe2\x80\x9d thing before, but that the message didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nseem to be getting through.\n\n Or,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not a message,\nthat was poor phrasing on their part, sorry, they\xe2\x80\x99re just flustered\ntalking to their favorite radio host.\n\n Awwww!\n\n They\nmeant to say that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the best birthday ever yet. And\nneither has their friend. Plus, they forgot to mention, millions and\nmillions of people have the same birthday as them, think of how many\npeople have their birthday today and all\nof them,\nthe Agency is sure, \xe2\x80\x9cjust want you\nto say that little\nthing again. Just once more, in your smoothest, deepest voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n They\nsay that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made it so our station is currently broadcasting on\nevery single radio frequency, so no one could possibly miss these\nspecial birthday greetings, and it will finally\nbe the \xe2\x80\x9cbest birthday ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n This\nis the last time. OK? I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it just once more, here I go. And\nreally try to enjoy this, because I am not\ndoing it again.\n\n BRINY\nDEPTHS\n\n [Momentary\nstatic]\n\n Oh.\n\n [More\nmomentary static]\n\n Whats\xe2\x80\x99\ngoing on? There\xe2\x80\x99s shouting coming from the break room it\xe2\x80\x99s, uh\xe2\x80\xa6it\nsounds like a scuffle, and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [More\nmomentary static, Cecil comes back at lower audio quality]\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s\nalso shouting coming from outside. Uhh, a lot of shouting.\n\n [Yet\nmore static]\n\n A\nroar of voices, the stomping feet of a crowd.\n\n [More\nstatic, Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s voice again lowers in audio quality]\n\n These\nbirthday greetings were apparently very special. I need to go see\nwhat this commotion is about.\n\n [Yet\neven more static, audio quality of Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s voice degrades even more, static gets more persistent\n\n]\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe back soon. In the meantime, those with birthdays and those who\nwere never born, I take you to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe\nBends\xe2\x80\x9d by Doomtree]\n\n Whoo!\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you! That was quite a scene.\n\n I\nwill\ntell you, right now.\n\n It\nseems that \xe2\x80\x9cBRINY DEPTHS\xe2\x80\x9d was, in fact, a code word (wish they\nhad warned me about that) for an undercover agent in the field.\nUnfortunately, it seems that it was the code world for every\nsecret agent in the field, the signal for all\nof them\nto do every nefarious action that they had been planted years ago to\nperform. All over town, people we thought of as friends and family\nrevealed themselves to be carefully planted agents.\n\n Adam\nBayer, weekday shift manager at the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, grabbed a discount soup\ndisplay and carried it to an unmarked van that had been sitting in\nthe parking lot as long as anyone could remember, and then drove\nwildly away.\n\n Hundreds\nof bushes and trees leapt into action, revealing themselves to be\nsuit-and-sunglass wearing agents in disguise, using clever costumes\nthat fooled all of us for years \xe2\x80\x93 such as holding a hand-written sign\nthat says \xe2\x80\x9cI am a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Larry\nLeroy, out on the edge of town, lit his refrigerator on fire, but he\nsaid that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because of any secret agent stuff, he just wanted to\ndo that. Someone had suggested it to him once, although he could not\nremember who.\n\n In\nfact, it seems that every single person in Night Vale was actually a\nsecret agent waiting to be activated. We had all been implanted with\nthe exact same code phrase, which is the kind of sloppy organization\nthat is just what our government is coming to.\n\n Or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever.\n\n And\nsuch.\n\n [Exasperated\nsigh]\n\n You\nknow, look. Honestly, my heart isn\xe2\x80\x99t in this reporting. Blah, blah,\neveryone we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known is secretly an agent. But\xe2\x80\xa6here I am,\nlisteners, secretly a hero. Secret even from myself! It was not\nHector who saved Dana, but me. Me, acting without memory or agency.\nWhat\xe2\x80\xa6what is happening to me? How do I not remember something so\nhuge?\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6I\nneed to talk to Carlos. Perhaps science can help me. Science so\nrarely applies to the real world, but once in a while it provides a\nnice metaphor or turn of phrase that makes you think about real\nthings differently. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping Carlos can do that for me.\n\n Now\nthat everyone has been activated as a secret agent, and did the one\nthing they were secretly supposed to do for years, everyone has just\ngone right back to doing what they had been doing before. Everything\nis back to normal, except that we all know we are all secretly\nundercover planted agents here to spy on each other and since we all\nknow it, we are no longer secret agents. We are just ourselves,\nsecretly.\n\n Listen,\nI know it\xe2\x80\x99s confusing. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent logic. Our\nextraterrestrial ancestors did.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for all the air being sucked out of the room you\xe2\x80\x99re in,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re sorry, we\xe2\x80\x99re so sorry, but this is the only way.\n\n Goodnight,\nNight Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: I let my haters be my motivators. Mostly they tell me I\nsuck, and then I get sad. This was a terrible idea.'
