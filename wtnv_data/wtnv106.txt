Episode 89: Who’s a Good Boy? Part 1
b'Who\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy? Who\xe2\x80\x99s the good boy?\nWho is it? Who is it?!?\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n All over town, the question painted\non walls, written in the sky by our flying aces, tapped out in Morse\ncode from within the walls of our homes: \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The radio station is, um,\nunavailable, as so much of the town is currently unavailable. Down\nfor maintenance, wiped off the map, however you want to say it.\n\n The strangers who do not move, but\nwho seem closer every time you look, they have torn our town apart.\nThey do not seem to have an agenda, no plan, just\xe2\x80\xa6destruction. They\nonly seek to rend, to shatter.\n\n Carlos has locked himself in the lab\nwith his team of scientists, working without sleep to find a solution\nto this crisis, as they have found solutions to so many crises\nbefore. He wanted me to stay there with him, since within the\nproximity of science is, of course, is the safest place to be in any\nnatural or unnatural\ndisaster, but\xe2\x80\xa6I am a reporter. I can\xe2\x80\x99t not report! My town needs me\nto witness! And so I will walk through my city, and I will witness.\n\n I sent my sister Abby and her family\nto the lab so they could keep my niece safe.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cKeep them safe!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to my\nbrother-in-law Steve.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAw, geez,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Abby\naround, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a bad thing that could happen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He really loves my sister. If I\xe2\x80\x99m to\nspend this time witnessing, maybe I should start there. Maybe I\nshould, finally, allow myself to see the depth of his love for my\nsister and their daughter.\n\n Ugh! And then he tried to hug me, and\nhe smelled like onions, and I shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no no, no no. We \xe2\x80\x93\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d better get you barricaded in there, Steve. I think I see some\nstrangers not moving,\xe2\x80\x9d while I slammed the lab door on him.\n\n The wreckage of Night Vale is\ncomplete. It is even worse than Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day 2013, when much of\nthe town was reduced to rubble and candy hearts.\n\n I passed by the Desert Flower Bowling\nAlley and Arcade Fun Complex, site of so many great \xe2\x80\x93 and terrible\n\xe2\x80\x93 memories. Old Woman Josie, throwing the ceremonial first pitch of\nthe bowling tournament, City Council and Station Management\nfinding\xe2\x80\xa6horrifying love on the skating rink, and other memories,\ntoo, that I\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk or think about.\n\n Now the complex was boarded up, under\nsiege from the strangers. There were three of them in its parking\nlot. None of them were moving. The only car in the lot was upside\ndown and on fire.\n\n Dark Owl Records was, somehow,\nuntouched. It was the only building in blocks without smashed\nwindows, and it somehow still had electricity. Michelle Nguyen and\nformer intern Maureen were leaning casually outside, smoking candy\ncigarettes. And this took a lot of re-lighting, as candy cigarettes\ndo not burn well at all.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaureen! Michelle!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re okay!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n They both rolled their eyes.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMichelle, how did you keep Dark\nOwl from being destroyed along with everything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She glanced at\nMaureen.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cUmmm,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\nMaureen said. \xe2\x80\x9cSay\xe2\x80\xa6someone was leading an army. Or whatever.\nThen, they could command that army to not attack a specific person or\nplace. Or whatever. So maybe, that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened. Anyway, if that\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat happened, then that person wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be leading that army any\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou quit your\ninternship?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like my boss. Especially since I found out what\xe2\x80\xa6ahem\xe2\x80\xa6who\nhe is. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have all the details before. Feels like I was misled.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar feeling, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, narrowing her eyes at\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least you\nwere just clueless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d I\nsaid.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaureen and I\nhave, like, a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michelle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very secret, but we\xe2\x80\x99re\nteaming up to save Night Vale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I\xe2\x80\x99m so\nglad you two have become such good friends,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n They looked at\neach other, for a long moment.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto, like, put a label on this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michelle. \xe2\x80\x9cNot everything\nhas to be named.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nMaureen. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, anyway, we have a secret plan. Plus, Chad is now\npanicking about what the thing he summoned has ended up doing, so\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to figure out how to reverse the ritual.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cL.O.L.!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Michelle.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cL.O.L.!\xe2\x80\x9d\nagreed Maureen, putting the lighter to the end of her cigarette and\nletting off a cloud of smoke that smelled like overcooked caramel.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look\nnow at the Community Calendar.\n\n All events this\nweek are canceled. This week is also canceled. You might be canceled,\ntoo.\n\n This has been the\nCommunity Calendar.\n\n I found Lucia,\nthe ghost that haunts the Haunted Baseball Diamond, looking sadly at\nthe nearby Shambling Orphan Housing Development. The development\nsomehow has been hit even harder than the rest of Night Vale. There\nwas almost nothing left to show that life had once existed there.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all happening as I was afraid it would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\nhow we can stop them?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have no\nideas. Only the fear, a writhing biting thing within me.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nslapped her spectral chest with her spectral hand, making a deep\nresonant pop. \xe2\x80\x9cIn here, Cecil.\xe2\x80\x9d She narrowed her eyes, and\npointed.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere! The\nbeast!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I saw, a few\nblocks away, a beagle puppy cross the street.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe beast?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nis so adorable, yes? Just the cutest. So cute that you would do\nanything for his\nlittle face, for his dumb floppy ears, yes? That is how he controls\nyou. That is how he controls everyone. He is so\ncute! You would do just anything for him! And you will. You will do\neverything for him.\nThings you never dreamed you would be capable of doing. Ghastly\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a good\nboy?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWho, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said.\n\n I called Carlos\nto see how far along he was in saving the day. He said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nvery far along at all, and it was frustrating to him. He said he\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeen letting brightly colored liquid bubble in beakers, and he has\nbeen writing numbers all over chalkboards, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped\nanything at all. He even drew a structural formula for cyclohexane,\nbut it also didn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is somehow a problem that can\xe2\x80\x99t be solved\nwith science, but there are\nno problems that can\xe2\x80\x99t be solved with science! Science fixes\neverything, and is always on the side of good! I just\xe2\x80\xa6I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nfigure out what these strangers want! They don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want\nanything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nsound very upset,\xe2\x80\x9d I told Carlos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not good\nfor you to get worked up like this. Take a break. Play some\nBloodborne,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll relax you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, yeah, I\nguess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, but I knew he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it. He was going to keep\ntrying to save Night Vale, and I loved him for it, even as I wished\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on himself.\n\n And now, a word\nfrom our sponsors:\n\n It is possible\nthe world is ending. If you cannot hide, then you must run. If you\ncannot run, then you must die.\n\n This message\nbrought to you by Clorox Bleach.\n\n Two blocks past\nMission Grove Park I saw the house of Francis Donaldson, the manager\nof the Antiques Mall. The door was off its hinges, the mailbox had\nbeen killed and skinned, and for reasons I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain to myself\nI crossed that ruined front yard and entered the house.\n\n I needed to see.\nI needed to report on this disaster.\n\n Three feet into\nthe door I looked up to see a stranger before me. Her shoulders went\nup and down, a deep, constant breathing. Otherwise\xe2\x80\xa6she did not\nmove. At this distance I could see the pupils of her eyes, unfocused,\nfrozen, on a point in the room several feet above my head. Her hair\nwas greasy, and it stuck to her face. Her skin had faded into gray\nlike a person dying, or a person carved from stone.\n\n She stood in the\nruined living room, surrounded by a pattern of destruction that\nsplashed out from her. The echo of a flurry of movement, even as she\nwas perfectly still.\n\n I\nwas distracted by the mess. And when I looked back, she was much\ncloser to me. I could\xe2\x80\xa6I could feel\nher breath. It was room temperature, unchanged by her body. Air in,\nair out, but no transformation.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\xa6Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. Her mouth did not move. Her voice came not from her, but\nfrom a glass of water on a side table that had somehow been spared\nthe destruction. The water vibrated slightly with the voice.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHello?\xe2\x80\x9d I\nsaid to the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The lamp hanging\nabove me laughed. There was no joy to it, just a replication of the\nsound of laughter. It went on, and on, slowly petering out to a quiet\nchoking, and then nothing.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\xa6do I\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the glass of water. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\xe2\x80\xa6nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNothing at\nall?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The lamp\nsnickered. My left shoe joined in, and I jumped back, but the\nstranger was even closer than before.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nwant\xe2\x80\xa6nothing at all. Everywhere there is\xe2\x80\xa6something. All of these\nthings, like\xe2\x80\xa6this glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The glass of\nwater shattered.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\xa6less\xe2\x80\xa6thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid my left shoe. \xe2\x80\x9cSoon there will be\xe2\x80\xa6no\xe2\x80\xa6things. We will take\naway your government. Your laws. Your infrastructure. All of\nyour\xe2\x80\xa6possessions. All\xe2\x80\xa6of\xe2\x80\xa6you.\nWhat\xe2\x80\xa6we\xe2\x80\xa6want\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6..no\xe2\x80\xa6thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cA \xe2\x80\x98why\xe2\x80\x99 is a\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d the lamp said sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe destroy\xe2\x80\xa6whys. We\xe2\x80\xa6destroy\nexplanations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I recognized the\nstranger. Behind the slack stillness there was a human face. It was\nFrancis herself, in the wreckage of her own home.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFrancis? What\nhappened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n At the sound of\nher name, her eyes focuses in for a moment, and flicked down toward\nme, before drifting back up to the ceiling.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI was\nmade\xe2\x80\xa6strange,\xe2\x80\x9d the lamp said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\xa6strange that I became\na\xe2\x80\xa6stranger. There is a cavern.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I merely looked\nat the lamp, confused.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6a\xe2\x80\xa6cavern\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Cecil.\nI was\xe2\x80\xa6taken\xe2\x80\xa6there. The ground\xe2\x80\xa6is covered\xe2\x80\xa6in mud. You\nwalk\xe2\x80\xa6through\xe2\x80\xa6the mud\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the darkness\xe2\x80\xa6because you\nthink\xe2\x80\xa6there must be\xe2\x80\xa6something else\xe2\x80\xa6but there\nis\xe2\x80\xa6never\xe2\x80\xa6anything\xe2\x80\xa6else\xe2\x80\xa6for years. You walk\xe2\x80\xa6through\xe2\x80\xa6the\nmud.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n My shoe chimed\nin.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you\nfeel\xe2\x80\xa6as though there might be\xe2\x80\xa6other\xe2\x80\xa6lost\npeople\xe2\x80\xa6also\xe2\x80\xa6searching\xe2\x80\xa6through the mud. Maybe\xe2\x80\xa6you can even\nhear\xe2\x80\xa6the soft\xe2\x80\xa6swish\xe2\x80\xa6of them\xe2\x80\xa6in the black\xe2\x80\xa6but your\nhands\xe2\x80\xa6never meet\xe2\x80\xa6and you cannot\xe2\x80\xa6speak\xe2\x80\xa6out. You\xe2\x80\xa6are\xe2\x80\xa6alone.\nSometimes\xe2\x80\xa6the mud\xe2\x80\xa6goes\xe2\x80\xa6over your head\xe2\x80\xa6and sometimes\xe2\x80\xa6it is\njust\xe2\x80\xa6a slight\xe2\x80\xa6damp\xe2\x80\xa6beneath your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The lamp spoke\nagain.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYears\xe2\x80\xa6go by.\nYou feel yourself\xe2\x80\xa6hollowed\xe2\x80\xa6out\xe2\x80\xa6by time. Everything\xe2\x80\xa6that was\nyou\xe2\x80\xa6slips\xe2\x80\xa6away. There\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6a\xe2\x80\xa6great\xe2\x80\xa6power\xe2\x80\xa6that\nreplaces\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\xa6with\xe2\x80\xa6his\xe2\x80\xa6desires.\nHe\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6your\xe2\x80\xa6leader\xe2\x80\xa6and\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\xa6want\xe2\x80\xa6what\xe2\x80\xa6he\xe2\x80\xa6wants\xe2\x80\xa6and\xe2\x80\xa6he\xe2\x80\xa6wants\xe2\x80\xa6nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you\nleave the mud and come back to Night Vale?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLeave?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n This time Francis\nherself spoke. Her vocal cords cracked with lack of use. Her eyes\nfocused on me again. Her parched lips clung to each other as she\nspoke.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6still\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6the\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6mud! I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6still\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the\nmud! Cecil! I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6still\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the\xe2\x80\xa6mud! I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6still\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the\nmud!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nShe said this over and over, quickly losing control of volume and\narticulation. Tears rolled down her face from her unblinking eyes.\n\n \nI turned and ran. Behind me her cracked voice, more and more\ndistant: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still in the mud! I\xe2\x80\x99m still\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nI had a vision of the beagle loping adorably through a burning\nbuilding, his\xe2\x80\xa6big stupid ears\xe2\x80\xa6.flapping as humans screamed,\nand\xe2\x80\xa6and pleaded around him, and he watched them burn, and replied\nonly\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cWoof.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWoof!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said, as Night Vale fell.\n\n [Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s\nspeech becomes more strained]\n\n I\nam, um\xe2\x80\xa6uh\xe2\x80\xa6passing\xe2\x80\xa6Louie Blasko on the street\xe2\x80\xa6..right now. He\nis frantically working the\xe2\x80\xa6uh\xe2\x80\xa6pumps\xe2\x80\xa6of his pipe organ, tipping\nhis hat at me while keeping time with a simple Gamelan\nsetup. He is\xe2\x80\xa6mmm\xe2\x80\xa6holding!\xe2\x80\xa6holding\xe2\x80\xa6out\nhis hat\xe2\x80\xa6for spare change.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cLouie, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I am saying to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and here I\nam\xe2\x80\xa6gesturing around at the\xe2\x80\xa6mmm\xe2\x80\xa6decimated street.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6.say\xe2\x80\xa6..weather!\xe2\x80\x9d he is telling me.\n\n \nI am\xe2\x80\xa6.not responding.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cSay\xe2\x80\xa6the word\xe2\x80\xa6weather!\xe2\x80\x9d he is hissing.\n\n \nWea\xe2\x80\xa6www\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n \nWeather?\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPlunder\xe2\x80\x9d\nby The\nFelice Brothers]\n\n [Cecil\nsounds more like himself now, with fewer pauses in his speech]\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that about?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Louie, but he was gone. And in his\nplace, there was a stranger, unmoving, breathing.\n\n \nI\xe2\x80\xa6I hurried on and I did not look back.\n\n \nA black sedan drove slowly through the streets, the first functioning\nvehicle I had seen among the carnage. I waved it down, and two men\ngot out. One was not tall, and the other was not short.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had nothing to do with this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who was not tall.\n\n \nThe man who was not short nodded vigorously.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cDo\xe2\x80\xa6you know\xe2\x80\xa6what happened?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n \nThe man who was not tall stood between me and the man who was not\nshort, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s new,\xe2\x80\x9d though I had\ndirected the question at both of them.\n\n The\nman who was not short said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe question isn\xe2\x80\x99t what\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6the question?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\ntalk to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s new,\xe2\x80\x9d the man who was not tall said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway,\nyou know\nwhat the question is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nHe leaned in close to me. I could smell anise on his breath.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is a good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a pen I could borrow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who was not\nshort.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cUm\xe2\x80\xa6uh, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, handing him the one from my reporter\xe2\x80\x99s\nnotebook.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He opened the trunk of the sedan, tossed the\npen into it, slammed it shut, and got back into the passenger seat.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s new,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other man, and then he\ntoo got into the sedan, and the strange pair drove away.\n\n Finally,\nI reached City Hall. Uh\xe2\x80\xa6it had been ravaged. Uh, there was no sign\nof City Council. Likely they have fled as they often do during danger\nto our town. Ahem.\nOr, I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to say, \xe2\x80\x9ctake a sudden and fortuitous vacation,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut I am not on the radio. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I do not have to say what I\nam supposed to say!\n\n I\nwonder if Station Management is even in town? Uh, I suspect that they\nmay have taken the same \xe2\x80\x9csudden and fortuitous vacation\xe2\x80\x9d as City\nCouncil, their many strange and endless appendages entwined on\nsome\xe2\x80\xa6beach somewhere.\n\n \nUh, Deputy Mayor Trish Hidge came running out of the building,\nholding a\xe2\x80\xa6desk lamp in one hand, and she ran by me wild with panic,\nhuffing, as she was barefoot.\n\n [Cecil makes\nhuffing sounds]\n\n \nOr, no.

A sneer in his lips, a\xe2\x80\x93 a\xe2\x80\x93 a strange bend to his legs,\nhis\xe2\x80\x93 his body was misshapen. It\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x93 no, he was not\ncute at all!\n\n \nBreath came in and out of his mouth, which was\xe2\x80\xa6gray, and squishy\nwithin.\n\n [Huffing\nsounds]\n\n \nThe beagle rose onto his hind legs, higher\xe2\x80\xa6and higher, until he\nwas\xe2\x80\xa6standing fully upright, his\xe2\x80\xa6his spine elongated and\nstraightened.\n\n \nI felt something rising in my throat. I did\xe2\x80\x93 I did\xe2\x80\x93 I did not\nwant to open my mouth for fear of an organ or bile or hot black tar\npouring out, but that was not what was pushing its way out of my\nmouth.
