b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the second YouTube release today, a preview of The Librarian featuring horoscopes. Transcript below the cut since this one\xe2\x80\x99s a little longer. Remember that The Librarian is available at nightvale.bandcamp.com and is also available on iTunes.\n\n \nJoseph Fink: What you are about to hear was recorded live at\nthe Skirball in New York City on January 16th, 2015. If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nthere, but would like to see what that was like, we have a behind the\nscenes video on our YouTube channel right now. Just go to\nyoutube.com/WelcomeToNightVale,\nand subscribe to get more bonus behind the scenes stuff in the\nfuture. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in a bit, but for now, I take you to\nthat strange little town, New York City.\n\n \nCecil: More on this story as it develops but first, today\xe2\x80\x99s\nhoroscopes.\n\n Aries: Aries, you have much in common\nwith a tree. A sadness that no one can see, or understand.\nCommunication only through silence and wind. Skin made of wood. The\nway you collect sustenance through roots buried in soil. You are\nvery, very much like a tree.\nAlmost impossible to tell the difference.\n\n Taurus: Taurus,\ntoday is the day that you change everything. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\nmisspoke, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Uh, let me try that again, OK? *Ahem*\nToday is the day that everything changes you. You will be completely\nunrecognizable. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. There ya go.\n\n Gemini:\nHow scared are you of centipedes, Gemini? I mean, no reason. The\nstars are just asking. Like, are you super super\nscared, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure, but you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty brave, right?\nLike, you could handle a couple of centipedes! You could handle a\nbunch of centipedes!\nRight, Gemini? No reason. I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\n\n Cancer:\nToday is an excellent day for you to demand a promotion, to approach\nthe one that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been secretly thinking about for years, to try\nyour hand at that new hobby that you are considering. Unfortunately,\nit is a terrible day\nfor getting that promotion, having that person say yes, and not\ninjuring yourself badly on a power sander. But you should at least\nfeel great about the attempt.\n\n Leo: There\xe2\x80\x99s just\na thick, green smudge here, and the word \xe2\x80\x9ccryptotoxicology.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\nguess that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, right?\n\n Virgo: Now, wait.\nThere are still some of you left? How did you survive the great\nculling of Virgos that swept through \xe2\x80\x93 oh! You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x98til next week. Sorry, I got confused there.\nOh, yeah, today looks very good for you, Virgo! Maybe use this lovely\nday to get all your affairs in order. Just a thought.\n\n Libra:\nAll your dreams will come true today. Or\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, one of them will.\nYou know that recurring dream where you\xe2\x80\x99re chased through a house\nthat seems like your own, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite, by a swarm of bees that\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t see even though you totally know that they\xe2\x80\x99re there? Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not that recurring dream, it\xe2\x80\x99s the other one. And I am so, so\nsorry.\n\n Scorpio: Your\narms look weird. And your face is a natural irritant. And your\npersonality leaves much to be desired, the principal desire being\nyour immediate absence. You disgust me, Steve Carlsbe\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\xa6I mean,\nScorpios? Ugh. Scorpios, right?\n\n Sagittarius: Buy\na tourniquet. The best that money can buy.\n\n Capricorn:\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s lucky number is imaginary! But, coincidentally, so are you,\nand your entire experience of the world.\n\n Aquarius: You\nwanna make some money fast? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, rob somebody. Commit fraud.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots of ways.\n\n \nPieces: You\xe2\x80\x99ve just won another brand new car! You stare bleakly at\nyour home filled with stacks upon stacks of new cars, occupying every\npossible space at impossible angles. Today\xe2\x80\x99s brand new car is wheeled\nin and as you feel its bulk pressing up against you, taking the last\nbit of your home that had still been yours to live in, you feel tears\nhot upon your cheeks. Congratulations on your prize!\n\n \nJoseph Fink: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it for the sample, but if you want\nmore, the full recording of The Librarian \xe2\x80\x93 with over 90 minutes of\nnew stuff just like that \xe2\x80\x93 is available at nightvale.bandcamp.com\nfor whatever price that much new Night Vale is worth to you, or on\niTunes. Just search Night Vale.\n\n \nHope you enjoyed the sample, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on March 15th with a\nbrand new episode and some huge news about the Night Vale book for\nyou.
