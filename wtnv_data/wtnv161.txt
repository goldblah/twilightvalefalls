138 - Harvest Time
b'Everything old will be new again, Except for when it\xe2\x80\x99s so old it disintegrates at your touch and scatters into oblivion.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s harvest time. A time of reaping, sowing, and rebirth. A time of turning over old soil and doing something with crops, maybe. No one really knows. \n\n All we know is that every night for the past week, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the air raid siren blasting in the town square and a (-) voice chanting: \xe2\x80\x9cBehold! Despair! Rejoice! Harvest time approaches!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n There has never been a harvest time before, so it should prove to be an exciting event. Or phenomenon. Or period of forced manual labor. No one currently has any guesses as to what exactly will be harvested. Since the land surrounding Night Vale is barren sand wastes, as noted on the new tourism billboard out on Route 800, which reads: \xe2\x80\x9cNow entering Night Vale. If you lived here, you\xe2\x80\x99d be dead by now.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer \xe2\x80\x93 remarked with pride that he\xe2\x80\x99s never encountered a single visible crop in all his years of farming. And then remarked with suspicion that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in routes, and if anyone tries to tell you different they\xe2\x80\x99re a filthy liar. He then opened a tobacco tin, pulled a wad of feathers from inside and ate them. \n\n A big congratulations to former Night Vale Community Radio intern Maureen, who has just received her heating, ventilation, and air conditioning or HVAC certification. It\xe2\x80\x99s apparently one of the only certifications one can receive from the Community College that does not require internship credits. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if she\xe2\x80\x99s passionate about the ventilation sciences yes, but it at least makes for a lucrative side hussle. Especially in this current heat wave. According to our friends at the Unavoidable Casualties Bureau, the current heat wave will statistically take eight lives by morning. Who will they be? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answers, of course, and there certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t a betting pool laying 7-to-1 odds on Susan Willman or anything like that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a fun thought experiment, right? \n\n Former intern Maureen has also expressed the need for an income boost, so she can help her girlfriend Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s store, Dark Owl Records, out of financial difficulties. Dark Owl Records has been on hard times since they took a stance against free market capitalism by ceasing use of actual currency. \n\n We have here a testimonial from one of Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied customers. Gladys R. from Old Town says: \xe2\x80\x9cOur air conditioner was making a terrible sound, and Maureen came in and installed new insulation and cooling pipes and even fixed the motor. It works great now. The insulation she used was made of premium wolf spider eggs, which she explained are particularly energy efficient, since they are made to withstand the extreme desert heat and keep all those tiny wolf spider embryos nice and cool. Millions of matured wolf spiders did begin pouring out of every vent in our house after a few weeks, but the air quality remained crisp and cool. \n\n An exterminator came in and sprayed for the spiders, which totally killed them, so that\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue anymore. But the poison that was used to kill that particular species did cause small benign tumors to form along my underarms, as well as my husband\xe2\x80\x99s. And the tumors began pulsating, and the doctors later discovered heartbeats inside the tumors, but they did stress the fact that these tumors are totally benign. The doctors advised a wait and see approach and put my husband and I on a course of prenatal vitamins. Unfortunately, the vitamins gave both of us a rash, which is slightly itchy, so we stopped taking them. There\xe2\x80\x99s no specialist in town to help us with this, and no ointment or home remedy that seems to work, that\xe2\x80\x99s a little frustrating, but the air is still very crisp and cool, and the unit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make that terrible sound anymore. Thanks Maureen, five stars! Would suffer sentient tumors again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Wow, what a nice review from Gladys. Personally, I love it when it\xe2\x80\x99s this hot out. It feels like everything is just moments away from catching fire. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating. \n\n Now the community calendar. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Um\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s all just notations in a childlike scrawl about how harvest time is coming. Oh wait, here\xe2\x80\x99s something else. Uh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a spaghetti feed tonight at the Elks Lodge. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to the spaghetti feed before, you\xe2\x80\x99re really missing out. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about folks in the community coming together and eating and eating and not knowing when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, because the spaghetti just keeps coming. It\xe2\x80\x99s about commitment and dedication. It\xe2\x80\x99s about not being a quitter. Remember when they called you a quitter growing up? \xe2\x80\x9cQuitter,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, pointing at you and your half eaten sack of pasta. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you wanna prove them wrong? Keep feeding! Feeding isn\xe2\x80\x99t about nourishment, not anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s about quantity, mass, volume, and proving you\xe2\x80\x99re no quitter. It\xe2\x80\x99s about commitment! Tonight at the Elks Lodge. This has been the community calendar.\n\n And now, traffic. When you were 12 years old, you sat in the passenger seat waiting for your mother to come out of the clothing store called Don\xe2\x80\x99s that used to be on main street. You turned the ignition to the battery-only setting so you could listen to the radio. You were reading a fictional tabloid newspaper and eating candy. The window was halfway down. A crisp breeze ruffled the newsprint in your hands. You were perfectly content, a feeling you won\xe2\x80\x99t experience again until well into your 30\xe2\x80\x99s. \n\n The car that was parked next you began to back away. You saw it from the corner of your eye, and you were overcome with the panicky vertigo sensation that your own car was moving forward, that it was picking up speed and rolling right into the Don\xe2\x80\x99s, through the display window, through the mannequins and Wrangler jeans that hung loosely around their plastic hips, and oh god your mother! She would be mangled among heaps of bloody denim and plastic body parts, and it would all be your fault somehow. Yes, you probably turned the ignition too far and somehow put the car into gear. You were only trying to listen to the radio. Your hands slammed onto the glove compartment, and you waited for the deafening impact of plate glass, and you squeezed your eyes shut. This has been traffic. \n\n Did it just get dark out suddenly? No. Wait. There\xe2\x80\x99s something covering the windows of the studio. What is that? It looks like someone has plastered flyers all over the building. Wait, let me peel one of these off. OK. Plastered all over other nearby buildings as well. They say \xe2\x80\x9cHarvest time is nigh. All will be cleansed.\xe2\x80\x9d Huh. I just got a text alert saying the same thing. Did you guys get that? Wait, is that smoke outside? Hang on a second.\n\n Yes. Um, the Night Vale fire department is assuring me now that the air is filled with black acrid smoke, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no fire to account for its origins. So the fire department says it\xe2\x80\x99s not actually smoke, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal dark air. Breathe deeply, go for a jog, let the little ones run free in the park, fire chief Ramona Incarnacian announced from insider her airtight bunker. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dark air is coming from all directions at once,\xe2\x80\x9d Incarnacian explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in avoiding any particular areas. Just go about your business, folks. Visibility is hovering right around zero, so please stick to the posted speed limits when driving. You will not be able to see the posted speed limits, so just try to remember what they are. We\xe2\x80\x99re on the honor system here, OK?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The fire department recommends trying memory games to help sharpen your skills, like \xe2\x80\x9clook look\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfruit flip\xe2\x80\x9d, or get yourself a Simon. You guys should remember Simon, the toy that flashed different colors in a certain order, and you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to correctly mimic their patterns. If you do it right, they tell you a secret. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret about someone else, maybe a stranger. Maybe someone you know. Probably your girlfriend. It\xe2\x80\x99s a secret about you, something she would never tell you, and certainly something you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. The only way to make sure that secrets stay safe is to get the pattern right.\n\n [sings] Blue blue red green, blue yellow, ochre, (-), cornflower, chartreuse, chartreuse, ecruu\xe2\x80\xa6 It helps to sing it.\xc2\xa0\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRemember if you fail at this or anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Incarnacian added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t try hard enough. Everything is a pure meritocracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Speaking of remembering, my niece Janice has been practically knocking herself out studying for the pre-SAT\xe2\x80\x99s. I know a lot of other kids at Night Vale High School are doing the same right now, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to run through a few practice questions to help them prepare. First, basic analogies.\n\n Scavenger is to carrion as love is to A) car accident, B) quitting your job, C) cooking for friends, or D) cooking friends. Wait, (that was) the answers for the verbal section, um.. Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s try math. [clears throat]\n\n How much would you have to be paid to pull out your own fingernails? The correct answer is 450 dollars. How much would you have to be paid to pull out your own fingernail sin the year 1979? The correct is 1,520 dollars, adjusting for inflation.\n\n How many box turtles would it take to eat a common raven? Hmmm. Think about that while we go to the weather. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cFriend or Foe\xe2\x80\x9d by Low Power https://soundcloud.com/lowpowermusic]\n\n Breaking news. A giant statue has been erected in the town squire. A post-minimalist anthropod the size of a suburban rent style house. It\xe2\x80\x99s made of Italian marble with tasteful touches of bronze, but also concrete, scraps of paper, chicken feet, and plastic (cub) caps from a 1979 Nissan Ultima for eyes. Scratched into the dirt around the statue are the words: \xe2\x80\x9cHarvest time is now\xe2\x80\x9d. Theories vary on what this means, but seem largely to fall in three categories.\n\n Religious leaders believe harvest time may finally signify the onset of end of times, which they can\xe2\x80\x99t deny will give them a certain smug satisfaction. There have been more than a few human sacrifices so far, which some are saying is a bit pre-emptive, but as John F. Kennedy famously said, \xe2\x80\x9csacrificers gonna sacrifice\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n Others are claiming this is all a viral marketing campaign for a new vegan restaurant. A voice was heard echoing the smoke-filled streets. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a chain, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten at one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a buffet thing,\xe2\x80\x9d the voices shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe restaurant is inside a statue.\xe2\x80\x9d Others still prepared a public demonstration by standing around holding blank signs, knowing they will feel strongly about something soon. \n\n Hm. Uh, looking at the community calendar, \xc2\xa0I no longer see the notation for harvest time. The Elks Lodge spaghetti feed is still happening though. Not too late to get down there and grab a plate. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99m headed right after this broadcast. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a report from the spaghetti feed that those in attendance felt painfully full only moments ago, or \xe2\x80\x9cabysmal with spaghetti\xe2\x80\x9d, as one feeder put it, and now fall somewhere in the spectrum between ravenously hungry and the absence of any sensation at all. Sounds delicious!\n\n OK, alright, I am getting quite a lot of reports all at once. Um, [clears throat]. It appears some things have gone missing. Citizen Jeremy Godfrey, who has been experiencing symptoms of midlife crisis for several months, reported a sudden and complete loss of the fear of death. My brother-in-law, Steve Carlsberg, reported his Christmas decorations are missing from his attic. Now this includes the life-size Santa that sits in an aluminum boat and casts a fishing pole string made of lights. My niece Janice expressed the dissenting opinion that the loss of these decorations may actually be a gain for the family. Janice also reported her PSAT practice test went completely blank, after she spent hours filling it out. Fortunately she enjoys standardized tests, so she just did it again. \n\n Professor Harrison Kip is missing two toes. Though luckily, they were his two extras. Siobhan Asdaq has reported the loss of a close acquaintance after inadvertently hurting their feelings online, but noted maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s better this way, if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be such a crybaby about little things like all caps curse-filled insults. Little league coach Betty Lucero reported all of her baseball bats are missing. She found her garage filled instead with fruit bats, which are at the time of this report drowsily eating bananas. \n\n Ah, also. Everyone in town reported their credit card numbers stolen and maxed out. Hmm. The charges on the cards originated from the same places: a building supply company, a scrap yard, and a Michael\xe2\x80\x99s craft store next to the Staples. It appears all the stolen funds have gone to building the new statue in the town square. Now there are mixed feelings about this, as it is a beautiful statue but you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s also credit fraud. \n\n And I have here and addendum to the testimonial I read earlier from former intern Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s air conditioning client, Gladys R. It reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe skin hangs loosely from our arms, where tumors once bulged with unknowing life. They hang flat and empty, with tiny open sores. Perhaps where something emerged in the night while we slept. We slept so well. I can\xe2\x80\x99t emphasize that enough. The rhythmic sensations of those little heartbeats vibrating against the fat and bones of our arms lulled us into a state of complete relaxation. A relaxation deeper than we have ever known before. We miss that. We really miss that. Wee can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep anymore. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully appreciate what we had until it was gone. We acknowledge that and we repent. We want to find whatever it was that was inside of us and put it back. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to look for or where to begin. If anyone has seen anything, please let us know.\xe2\x80\x9d Thanks, Gladys R.! Will do.\n\n Wait, are you guys hearing that? There\xe2\x80\x99s a new sound coming from the town square, it-it sounds like the trumpeting of ram\xe2\x80\x99s horns. And the smoke has started clearing up, and now there remains only a gray dusty quiet.\n\n Is it over? Did anything really happen? So many things are like that, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? Anticipation and disappointment. Loss and abundance happening at the same moment. So that you end up with only the uneasy illusion of balance or meaning. I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing now that there\xe2\x80\x99s an engraved placard on the anthropod statue, previously unseen because it was slopped over with plaster and looked hastily scratched into the back of a license plate with a nail. It says, [clears throat] \xe2\x80\x9cRipeness is perfection, and perfection is the step before decay.\xe2\x80\x9d Awww, that\xe2\x80\x99s sweet, right? Anyway, better get down to the spaghetti feed before it\xe2\x80\x99s over. Oh, and the answer is 2. 2 box turtles can completely devour a common raven.\n\n Stay tuned for the original 1972 folk rock ad jingle for the Simon memory game entitled \xe2\x80\x9cNever Forget to Remember \xe2\x80\x93 and Remember to Forget to Forget\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: If you circle the letters in the Bible just right, you get the phrase: \xe2\x80\x9clightly dressed kale\xe2\x80\x9d. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means, but it\xe2\x80\x99s direct from God.'
