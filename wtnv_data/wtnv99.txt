Episode 83 - One Normal Town
b'Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in.\nBreathe out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t breathe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbreathe.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Our neighboring town of Desert Bluffs\nis no more. It has been swept from the map. Its borders, a bad\nmemory. Its name, a forgotten joke.\n\n Oh, listeners, I have long dreamed of\nsaying these words, although the circumstances are different than I\ncould have ever foreseen.\n\n Mayor Cardinal announced today that \xe2\x80\x93\nafter months of extending loans and other budgetary aid to the\nstruggling community \xe2\x80\x93 her and Mayor Cardozo of Desert Bluffs\nagreed that the path to financial stability lay in (I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe\nI\xe2\x80\x99m saying this) merging the two towns.\n\n As of this week, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s borders\nwill extend to include the dumb buildings that used to belong to\nDesert Bluffs, and all the weirdos that for some reason chose to live\nthere.\n\n Dana said that she understood there\nwould be some adjustment needed from everyone, and then went on to\nsay some other stuff that didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter because apparently\nit\xe2\x80\x99s fine that Desert Bluffs\nis now part of Night Vale, and no one has a problem with that, and\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s OK. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\n\n Our\nnew sheriff, Sam, who has been an outspoken opponent to the monetary\naid given to Desert Bluffs because of the strain it puts on law\nenforcement budgets, reacted as expected. At a press conference, they\nexpressed their extreme\ndispleasure in this development by singing selections from Richard\nForeman\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, \xe2\x80\x9cFilm\nIs Evil: Radio Is Good\xe2\x80\x9d while weeping copiously.\n\n In\nresponse to follow-up questions from the attending journalists, Sam\nquietly said, \xe2\x80\x9cListen. I just need this right now, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d before\nvowing that they would continue their strong opposition to the\nmayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan for unification, and then softly crying a little more.\n\n And\nnow, traffic.\n\n There\nonce was a farmer who never much thought of leaving his land. He was\ncomfortable where he was, and comfortable with only ever being merely\ncomfortable.\n\n He\nhad no close friends, although a few people at the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market\nknew who he was.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nI know who he is,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them might have said, although none of\nthem ever did. None of them were ever asked.\n\n One\nnight, as he was sitting down alone to dinner, he heard a loud party\nhappening out in his field. Music, conversation, laughter. More\nconfused than annoyed, he went out to see who could have set up a\nparty in his remote field.\n\n But\nthere was no one there.\n\n Instead,\nthe party now sounded as though it were coming from his house. He ran\nback in, now afraid he was dealing with intruders.\n\n But\nthere was no one there.\n\n The\nsound of the party was again coming from outside. Not from his\nfields, but from the empty stretch of road that led from nowhere much\nto his little farm (which was also nowhere much). He went out to the\nroad.\n\n But\nthere was nothing.\n\n The\nsound of the party was now just over a gentle slope in the road. He\nfollowed it.\n\n Nothing.\n\n Then\nit was just around the corner. Then, where those trees covered the\nroad in shadow. He followed and followed the sound, each time finding\nthat he was almost but\nnot quite to its\nsource.\n\n And\nhe never came back to his farm again.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave no idea what happened to him,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the folks at the\nFarmer\xe2\x80\x99s Market might have said, although none of them ever did. None\nof them were ever asked.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n The\nRalph\xe2\x80\x99s supermarket announced a small change to their sales\nstructure, indicating that they will no longer be following the\n\xe2\x80\x9cbring food you want up to the cashier and pay for it\xe2\x80\x9d model that\nhas been played out for years now, and instead will be structuring\nthemselves as the world\xe2\x80\x99s first auction supermarket.\n\n Any\ncitizen looking to buy food from Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s will have to come to one of\ntheir daily scheduled auctions and bid on the kitchen staples and\nsnacks as they are brought up for auction one by one.\n\n For\ninstance, Lot 402 might be a banana, while Lot 403 might be a bag of\nSun Chips and a bottle of tomato juice.\n\n Charlie\nBaer, new weekday shift manager at the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe\nthis will be a more exciting and fun way for consumers to get the\nfood they need. And to pay more for it. A lot\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIn competition with others, so that if you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get that peanut butter, somebody else will. And then they\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave peanut butter and you won\xe2\x80\x99t. Better open up those wallets and\nmake sure you get the food you need.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Fortunately\nfor me, Carlos tends to do our shopping, since I personally have\xe2\x80\xa6a\nlittle trouble with auctions, due to some traumatic experiences in my\npast. I mean, I know that, as the saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9cpast performance is\nnot a predictor of future results,\xe2\x80\x9d but still\xe2\x80\xa6I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit\nthese auctions out.\n\n As\npart of the launch event for the auction system, Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s employees\nwill stand on the supermarket\xe2\x80\x99s roof, pelting passers-by with water\nballoons and expired produce, and drunkenly chanting the lyrics to\nevery Cat\nStevens song in unison, until they have run out of breath and,\neyes locked with each other, with hunched-over panting silence,\ncontinue to mouth the lyrics they no longer have the breath to say.\n\n Back\nnow to the news.\n\n The\ndissolve of Desert Bluffs into Night Vale continues. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only\nnew people, but new ways of life.\n\n Dave\nMorales Cari\xc3\xb1o, a former Desert Bluffs resident, announced the\nfounding of the first-ever Joyous Congregation of the Smiling God\nhere in Night Vale, on an old industrial stretch of the eastern\nexpressway.\n\n Night\nVale is a proud city of bloodstone worshipers, but certainly there\nare many in town who know of the\xe2\x80\xa6power of the Smiling God, and\nbelief and worship in the Smiling God is not a new thing here. In\nfact, a few long-time Night Vale residents attended the inaugural\nservice at the Joyous Congregation\xe2\x80\x99s church, located in a storefront\nthat used to sell leaf blowers and leaf blower accessories.\n\n The\nCity Council said that sales from their bloodstone factory have\nfallen by as much as one percent, and that this is totally not okay\nwith them.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\nseeing someone now,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, in a high-pitched whiny voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just not a good time for us to be losing any income! Mayor\nCardinal won\xe2\x80\x99t let us devour\nthe Joyous Congregation, but we urge you to stick to the traditional\nworship of bloodstone circles. Like your mother, and your\ngrandmother, and the lizard people before her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Paul\nBirmingham, local community activist who lives in a lean-to behind\nthe library, wanted everyone to know that he was against it.\n\n When\nquestioned what he was against, specifically, he shrugged and said \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. It. All of\nit. Or, some of it. The bad parts. Totally opposed. Not a fan at\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\n He\nwaved signs, all of which just said \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Paul\nhas a long history of political activism in Night Vale, starting with\nhis \xe2\x80\x9coregano should be legal\xe2\x80\x9d campaign that he waged ferociously\nfor the better part of the 80s, only giving it up when he found out\nthat oregano already was legal.\n\n Then\nhe shifted into environmental activism, marching every day in front\nof City Hall to draw attention to his controversial \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I see\nas red, is what you see as blue? What if color isn\xe2\x80\x99t even real?\xe2\x80\x9d\ncampaign.\n\n More\nrecently, he had joined the Air-Filled Earth Society, the group that\nbelieves the earth is a precariously inflated orb that could pop or\ndeflate at any moment.\n\n Now,\nhe seems to have dropped all of his previous specific beliefs for the\nmore general stance of negativity without target. A \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d directed\nat nothing.\n\n Reporters\nreport his breath sighed. Reporters report his shoulders sagged.\nReporters report his shouting waned, his signs drooped. Paul wiped\nhis brow.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cJust\xe2\x80\xa6something\nhas to be true, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSomewhere in all of this,\nsomething has to be\ntrue!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nsquinted at the sky before concluding, \xe2\x80\x9cI still can\xe2\x80\x99t see them. I\nwish I could. Then maybe I would understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nwandered back to his lean-to, seeming to have grown years older, his\ndefiance burned out of him.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is sponsored by a happy-looking dog that\xe2\x80\x99s woofing and wagging\nhis tail.\n\n He\njust wants you to play, or to pet him! Or maybe, just to stop feeling\nsad for a moment. He wants what\xe2\x80\x99s best for you,\neven if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that he wants it. His instincts have been\ntinkered with, made to align with your interests. And now, his\nhappiness is yours.\n\n He\xe2\x80\x99s\na big-eyed, woofing dog, and he\xe2\x80\x99s dancing from paw to paw because\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s so excited to make your life better.\n\n Are\nyou about to take him for a walk? Oh, no! Did someone say the W word?\nDid the physical needs of an animal companion force someone to also\ngo outside and move their body, both things that will chemically make\nthem feel better?\n\n What\na convenient system. What a good boy!\n\n What\na good boy.\n\n This\nhas been brought to you by a happy-looking dog that\xe2\x80\x99s woofing and\nwagging his tail.\n\n Breaking\nnews: The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police and the City Council have taken\nunilateral action to disunite Night Vale and Desert Bluffs. The\nsheriff, backed by the hulking figures of the City Council, led a\nfleet of Secret Police cars into neighborhoods that used to be Desert\nBluffs, announcing that all these buildings were now Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand that everyone living there needed to go.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\nagainst you personally,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe sheriff said as their Secret Police chased after former Desert\nBluffs citizens with what could be described as comically-sized\npotato sacks, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the grim seriousness with which the\npolice conducted their chase.\n\n The\nformer Desert Bluffs citizens started to flee, panic set pale and\nglistening on their faces. But they stopped when they saw yet another\ncar coming at them from the other direction.\n\n Black\nsedan, tinted windows, unmistakably governmental.\n\n It\npulled directly in front of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s group, bringing everyone to\na momentary confused halt.\n\n Out\nof the car stepped Mayor Cardinal. She looked around at the scene as\nit lay. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have seemed younger or more tired. She took a\nslow, deliberate breath.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cGo\nhome, Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the sheriff. \xe2\x80\x9cGo home, all of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nsheriff looked around at their police officers for support, and then\nshouted back, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t stop us, Dana. We will drive these people\nout of our town.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nSam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t. You won\xe2\x80\x99t because it\xe2\x80\x99s their\ntown too, now. You won\xe2\x80\x99t because there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere else they should go.\nYou won\xe2\x80\x99t because it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing to do and I think, somewhere in\nthere, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a bad person. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong about that, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbe the first time. But primarily, you won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nshe folded her arms, and she said nothing more.\n\n The\nSecret Police still held their potato sacks, unsure now of what they\nshould do. Their sheriff no longer ordered, or even goaded, but just\nstared thoughtfully at their mayor.\n\n The\nformer citizens of Desert Bluffs stopped fleeing, looking back at\nthis first figment of hope.\n\n And\nthen the sheriff got in their car, turned it around, and drove away.\nThe Secret Police all got in their cars and followed. The City\nCouncil roared and stomped but, without the police to back them up,\nthey too eventually retreated.\n\n And\nstill Dana stood, silent, arms folded, until the last of them was\ngone. She turned to the new citizens of Night Vale who had, moments\nbefore, been fleeing.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHi,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Dana. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to get in touch if you have any\nproblems, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\ngot back in her car. She, too, left.\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6uh\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x93\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I stand on this scene, as it just unfolded. I\nneed to think about it. While I think about it, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the\nweather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe\nSky Is Calling\xe2\x80\x9d by Kim\nBoekbinder]\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat. We all have our regionalisms. For instance, in many parts of\nthe country, there is a sandwich, known as a sub sandwich, that is in\nother places known as a hero, a hoagie, a grinder, a longburger, a\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s delight, or a bread burrito.\n\n This\nis one example of a difference in culture. There are others.\n\n It\nis in these little details that we see ourselves, that we define how\nwe are not others, and\nthus how we are\nourselves.\n\n When\nconfronted with someone whose \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d is not our\n\xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d we are forced to confront the most frightening prospect\nof all: that there is no such thing\nas \xe2\x80\x9cnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d Just the accidental cultural moment we happened to\nbe born into, a cultural happenstance that never existed before, and\nwill never exist again.\n\n Our\nidea of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d is a city built on sand. For instance, for us,\nour city is literally built on sand and this is our \xe2\x80\x9cnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d We\nresist difference because it requires we acknowledge that the culture\nwe grew up with as \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d is just a momentary accident. It\nrequires we accept that the world we were born into will never be the\nsame as the world we die in. The longer we live, the more we become\ninterlopers, even in our home towns. But, if we\xe2\x80\x99d let it happen,\nalso, the more we will learn.\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6cannot\nsay I am always happy about Desert Bluffs. It can be said that I have\nranted about them on the radio, sometimes for hours, while listeners\ncalled in to complain that they wanted me to talk about something\n(anything!) else. I\nhave thrown things at the microphone, and attempted to cast spells\nupon Desert Bluffs that would drive them into ruin.\n\n But\nmy happiness, or unhappiness, is\xe2\x80\xa6irrelevant to their existence.\nThey exist. And so do I. And now our differing \xe2\x80\x9cnormals,\xe2\x80\x9d in such\nclose proximity, perhaps will edge just slightly\ntoward each other.\n\n Night\nVale may never again be the Night Vale I knew, but it will be some\nkind of Night Vale. It will be a version of our town that someday,\nsomeone will look back on and think, \xe2\x80\x9cThose were the days! That was\nwhat was normal!\xe2\x80\x9d And that person will be wrong. And that person\nwill be right.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s winning lottery numbers, broadcast to\neveryone simultaneously, and so reducing each jackpot share to a\nsmall but fair amount.\n\n And,\nfrom a town that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the town it was before, and then won\xe2\x80\x99t be the\ntown it has become, and then will change again, and then again after\nthat, and all of them the same town, and all of them our\ntown:\n\n Goodnight,\nNight Vale.
