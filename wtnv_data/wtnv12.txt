He\xe2\x80\x99s coding an urgent message to all of us.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n First, the news.\n\n\n Old Town Night Vale residents are complaining about extremely noisy sunsets. Several agitated citizens are pushing for the City Council to do something about the solar shrieking every evening for the past few weeks.\n\n\n One homeowner described the sound as \xe2\x80\x9cthe parched cries of sad buzzards, or perhaps even the unholy voice of Old Scratch himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The City Council, speaking in unison at a televised press conference, said that the noise is just the windmill farms that litter the unfortunate wastelands of Desert Bluffs, and that the noises do not fall under Night Vale jurisdiction.\n\n\n Walton Kinkade, president of the community group Soundproof Old Town, said that the windmills can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be the source of the noise, as they are non-existent and also don\xe2\x80\x99t work, because of Desert Bluffs\xe2\x80\x99 staggering incompetence. The City Council called a second press conference, wherein they all wordlessly stared down Kinkade for fourteen uninterrupted minutes. Their dark eyes tore holes straight through the community spokesman (metaphorically speaking), until his soul was compacted into what looked like a partially chewed black-eyed pea (literally). \xc2\xa0\n\n\n To date, only Old Town residents have reported hearing these inconceivable noises every evening as the sun crosses the indifferent horizon.\n\n\n And the noises seem to be taking their toll; there have been two heart attacks, twelve cases of significant muscular atrophy, and at least two dozen claims of folks growing third eyes \xe2\x80\x93 including Kinkade himself, who had an arachnid-like eight eyes when he spoke before City Council yesterday morning.\n\n\n No other neighborhood can hear the sounds. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n I spoke to Simone Rigadeau in the Earth Sciences building at Night Vale Community College about this scientifically fascinating story, and she called it a simple case of celestial just desserts.\n\n\n Full disclosure, listeners: Rigadeau does not work in Earth Sciences. She is a transient living in the recycling closet of the Earth Sciences building, and she collects cans as pets.\n\n\n There is another hearing scheduled at 4:00 AM tomorrow, on the highest ledge overlooking Skeleton Gorge, which can only be accessed by government helicopters. All previous endeavors to scale the cliff-side by rock-climbing enthusiasts have failed in extravagantly gory fashion.\n\n\n The Council issued a statement wishing Kincaid luck in attending this mandatory meeting.\n\n\n Breaking news: we\xe2\x80\x99ve received confirmation from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police that fugitive Hiram McDaniels was finally apprehended. McDaniels has been on the lam since August.\xc2\xa0He was wanted on several counts of insurance fraud, falsifying identification papers, evading arrest, and assaulting a police vehicle with fire.\n\n\n McDaniels was spotted near his Earl Road apartment early Saturday morning by several alert neighbors. The neighbors said they were able to identify McDaniels because he matched police sketches of an 18 foot tall five-headed dragon that had been posted across Night Vale. Fingerprints later confirmed that McDaniels was definitely a dragon.\n\n\n Secret Police are still unsure of McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 motives for returning home. And, well, listeners, our station intern Stacey just handed me a photo of Hiram McDaniels. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very dynamic-looking dragon. \xc2\xa0The raw power. The intensity in those five faces, those many sets of piercing \xc2\xa0blue and red and black and green and yellow eyes. I can certainly see how he charmed his way out of an arrest. \xc2\xa0He must never get tickets.\n\n\n What a guy!\n\n\n An unsigned press release I found under my pillow this morning announces the following:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a free party this Friday at the Abandoned Missile Silo outside of town. The purpose of this party is to celebrate! There will be no sign, or music, but the party is inside the silo. This party takes place at 3:00 AM and will be over at 3:05. \xc2\xa0It will be dark, both inside and outside the silo. Grope blindly towards happiness. Keep your mouth open and your teeth together to indicate you are at a party. You will hear noises, and later, you will not. \xc2\xa0This party will feature special guest Bon Jovi, although he does not yet know it. See you there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n An interesting note on Hiram McDaniels: intern Stacey tells me that she\xe2\x80\x99s been googling the roguish dragon. Did you know that he has a blog? \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s a very smart fellow, some really groundbreaking ideas. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one post from last week:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were mayor of Night Vale, I would give incentives for small business development, and focus on youth physical fitness programs. Human youth are the human future, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Well, it seems a certain multi-headed fugitive wants to become mayor of Night Vale. You have my vote, Hiram! \xc2\xa0\n\n\n Thursday night, the City Council is voting on a new measure that would prohibit breathing as an involuntary muscular action. Historically, the human body has been able to control breathing without the brain needing to consciously activate the diaphragm. Under the new rule, all residents of Night Vale would be required to make the physical choice of whether or not \xe2\x80\x93 and when \xe2\x80\x93 to breathe.\n\n\n The City Council said that we have too long taken the receipt of oxygen for granted, and that the sense of entitlement must cease. If the vote passes, residents will have until March 1st of next year to learn to control these involuntary muscle groups during lucid sleep.\n\n\n Detractors say that it is our constitutional right to breathe how we want, and that it is not the government\xe2\x80\x99s job to legislate breathing. The Council responded by waving a brick in the air at reporters and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned to beat our own hearts! We taught ourselves to wet our own corneas! We have pulled ourselves up from nothing! It is the American dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Then, they took a deep breath all together, lowered the brick, broke it into pieces, and devoured it. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n And now a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n We all want to live forever, right?\n\n\n Wrong.\n\n\n Think about watching your family die as you selfishly carry on, your children aging and passing, your grandchildren, and so on. Think of all the friends you\xe2\x80\x99ll make, but eventually lose.\n\n\n You don\xe2\x80\x99t want that! No!\n\n\n You know the earth is eventually going to be swallowed by the sun, right? And one day, you would be present for this greatest of all apocalypses. As fascinating as this would be, scientifically speaking, this excitement would fade as the pain of thousand-degree flames engulfed your tender body, and your aged mind would be so alone in this interminable torture.\n\n\n Does this sound like something you want? We didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\n\n\n Immortality is stupid. Think before you wish.\n\n\n This message brought to you by Direct TV.\n\n\n Dear listeners, right after we reported on Hiram McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 interest in becoming Night Vale mayor, the dirty campaign tactics came into play \xe2\x80\x93 stirring up bad feelings, and slinging the old municipal mud.\xc2\xa0Incumbent Mayor Pamela Winchell issued a statement citing township bylaws that prohibit prisoners from running for public office.\n\n\n Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just like a career politician, such as Mayor Winchell, to make such unethical, ad hominem attacks on a great reptilian beast, simply because he is in jail? It sounds to me like the mayor is feeling McDaniels breathing down her neck! Breathing dragon fire, that is.\n\n\n Give \xe2\x80\x98em hell, Hiram!\n\n\n The following is a test of the Emergency Dream Broadcast System. In the event of an actual emergency, you would just now be experiencing a dream in which you were in the neighborhood where you grew up, only all the houses are now black, featureless cylinders. Just row after row of these blank dark cylinders, stretching out around you. You are home\xe2\x80\xa6but you are also somewhere from whence you will never find home again.\n\n\n There is someone waiting for you at the end of the longest street. You know that, although you do not know who. \xc2\xa0You try to run down the street and it grows longer and longer. You pass by one cylinder in particular and know that it\xe2\x80\x99s your house. You stop running. You approach the blank face of the cylinder, its surface seeming to devour light and sound. You reach out and you are inches from touching it. \xc2\xa0Just then you hear a ding. You look up to see words in the sky. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODS, they say. ALERT VALID UNTIL 3:00 PM.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Once again, this has been a test of the Emergency Dream Broadcast System. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n The Night Vale Mall is having to deal with angry calls from parents, after the Santa they hired for Christmas photos was once again a no-show. Mall public relations officials said that the missing Santa is actually a performance art piece, meant to show people how our capitalist idols are truly nonexistent, ghosts of materialistic ideas that we have embraced as replacements for true spiritual meaning.\xc2\xa0A long line of upset parents and crying children stretched from Santa\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair to just past the Hollister.\n\n\n The mall PR officials added that they have a really cool idea for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. They\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, like, moving pictures of actual beating hearts projected onto a large teddy bear? Which has been stretched open like a vivisected frog from seventh grade life science?\n\n\n Officials added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be monstrous and beautiful. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what art really is. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even know yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n They concluded by chanting and pumping their arms in unison, like a lower, Paleolithic version of the YMCA dance. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n And now\xe2\x80\xa6the weather. \xc2\xa0\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe Brightness\xe2\x80\x9d by Anais Mitchell (On the band\xe2\x80\x99s Discography page, this song is titled \xe2\x80\x9cOf a Friday Night,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is listed elsewhere as The Brightness)]\n\n\n During the break, I received a message from Mayor Winchell\xe2\x80\x99s office responding to our previous reports.\n\n\n According to the mayor, mayoral elections aren\xe2\x80\x99t for another three years, and Hiram McDaniels is ineligible to run \xe2\x80\x93 not only because of his jail stay, but also because he is neither a Night Vale resident, nor a human being. There is, she says, no precedent for a five-headed dragon as elected official.\n\n\n Mayor Winchell also pointed out that writing the throwaway phrase \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were mayor of Night Vale\xe2\x80\x9d on a blog is not an official declaration of candidacy.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere is paperwork!\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Winchell shouted into my voicemail. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just\xe2\x80\xa6argh!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, trailing off slightly at the end.\n\n\n What followed was about ninety-five seconds of loud stomping, and what sounded like wood chopping in the distance, before the message finally ended.\n\n\n Allow me a retort, dear listeners, with this brief editorial:\n\n\n With all due respect, Madame Mayor, have we not had enough dragon-bashing? Our great country once held to some terrible old customs, but we grew up. We learned. We abolished slavery. Women won the right to vote. Ghosts can now marry (but of course, not have children \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, that would be a real slippery slope).\n\n\n And our own little burg is on the verge of becoming the first city in this great nation to legalize time travel. So let\xe2\x80\x99s loosen our collars! Let\xe2\x80\x99s march into the reptilian future, not cling to the narrow past. Just because a dragon is a dragon, and has five heads, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he can\xe2\x80\x99t lead our community.\n\n\n Sure, critics will say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! But Cecil! What if his five heads don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on something? What if one\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s build this school!\xe2\x80\x99 But another\xe2\x80\x99s like, \'No more schools!\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0And the others are drunk or sleepy or something? \xc2\xa0How can we agree to elect five heads that can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with themselves?" cope="" curl="" dark.="" dear="" decorator.="" deeply="" do="" doesn&rsquo;t.="" don&rsquo;t="" drapes?="" drowsily,="" dry.="" early="" ears.="" election="" endorsement="" excepting="" fast="" few="" first,="" flinches="" follow.="" for="" free="" from="" future="" future,="" gentle="" get="" gone,="" goodnight,="" goodnight.="" great="" harm="" hearing="" heavily="" here="" here.="" hiram="" hiram!="" home."="" homes="" i="" i.="" immediate="" in="" interior="" is="" isn&rsquo;t="" it="" it&rsquo;s="" just="" know="" later.="" lead="" leader="" leave="" listener.="" listening,="" lost="" match="" mayor="" mcdaniels="" me,="" me.="" microphone,="" mind!="" mud,="" multi-headed="" my="" negative="" never="" night="" no.="" now="" now,="" now.="" of="" offer="" official="" on="" our="" past="" petition="" please="" present.="" property="og:description" protecting="" proud="" proverb:&nbsp;does="" quiet.="" quite="" rains="" rally.="" rest,="" rise.="" say="" says,="" scarlet="" settles="" shame="" silent="" sleep="" sleepy="" so="" song="" soon,="" souls="" special,="" spiders="" stay="" stereotypes="" sure,="" that="" that.="" the="" their="" think="" this="" this,="" three="" time,="" to="" today&rsquo;s="" together,="" too="" town="" traveling="" tuned="" two-hour="" under="" us="" us,="" vale.="" variations,="" voice,="" want.="" we="" what="" while="" will="" with="" world="" worst="" years,="" you="" you&'
