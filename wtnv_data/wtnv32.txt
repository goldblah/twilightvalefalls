Episode 31 - A Blinking Light up on the Mountain
b'Our God is an awesome God. Much better than that ridiculous god that Desert Bluffs has.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n There is, listeners, a Blinking Light up on the Mountain. It is red. Blinking Lights are always red.\n\n\n It is nestled among the crags and nooks of the precipitous slope. We can all see it \xe2\x80\x93 no use denying it! The City Council tried. \xe2\x80\x9cNope,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cBlinking Light? Let me think. Blinking Light...no, sorry, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ring any bells!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But then a bell started ringing \xe2\x80\x93 a signal from the watchman who lives in Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s Invisible Clock Tower, letting us know that he had seen something. And we all saw it, too. It was a Blinking Light, up on the Mountain.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Council, crawling backwards through a window into Town Hall, one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cAhh, well\xe2\x80\xa6it was worth a shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n What does this light mean? Who will dare investigate it? Will it spell our doom? Dear listeners, who knows? No one.\n\n\n And probably, more later. For now, just this. Just a Blinking Light \xe2\x80\x93 red \xe2\x80\x93 up on the Mountain.\n\n\n Harrison Kip, adjunct professor of archaeology at Night Vale Community College, announced an upcoming three-part series on Night Vale Community Television \xe2\x80\x93 defending his fringe views that the pyramids, and other ancient structures, were constructed by human beings rather than benevolent ancient aliens.\n\n\n Harrison, against decades of reasonable evidence, raved that \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible that these historical marvels could have been made using mathematics and slave labor.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to explain, shrieking like an obvious lunatic, that agriculture was probably not started on Mars, and that humanity was created through evolution, and not through selective breeding of alien DNA.\n\n\n We reached out for comment to the president of Night Vale Community College, Sarah Sultan \xe2\x80\x93 who is a smooth, fist-sized river rock \xe2\x80\x93 about the extreme beliefs expressed by a staff member. Sarah had no comment, as she is a smooth, fist-sized river rock, and unable to speak. She can write, however, and wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cNo comment,\xe2\x80\x9d before drawing an insulting caricature of your humble reporter \xe2\x80\x93 which was hurtful, and unnecessary.\n\n\n Listeners, here\xe2\x80\x99s something weird.\n\n\n I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in the studio with me at this very moment, and it is definitely something, and definitely weird. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how it got here, but\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how I got here either. Causation is difficult and confusing.\n\n\n I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried touching it\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try touching it now.\n\n\n Oh!\n\n\n I believe it likes being touched, because it started to vibrate and lean in towards my body, but\xe2\x80\xa6that could just be its way of expressing anger or immense physical suffering. When something is this weird, one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t assume to understand anything specific about it at all.\n\n\n Is it a bomb?\n\n\n Is it one of those objects that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bomb?\n\n\n Is it just a kind of dog?\n\n\n We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And we will never find out. And we will never try to find out. Ignorance may not actually be bliss, but it certainly is less work.\n\n\n So, with no new information and with nothing learned, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat what I said, gesturing at it with a hand you cannot see.\n\n\n Listeners, here\xe2\x80\x99s something weird.\n\n\n A continuation on our previous report about a Blinking Light up on the Mountain:\n\n\n As many of you noted, the very nature of our report indicated the existence of a Mountain \xe2\x80\x93 which is surprising, given that we live in vast, desert flatness. So yes, there is a Mountain. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start there.\n\n\n There is a Mountain now, rising up out of the alluvial\xc2\xa0Floodplain. It is made of rock, and height, and awe. Its peak is higher than where I am now, but lower than the Void.\n\n\n Larry Leroy, out on the edge of town, said that it was definitely a Mountain, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a Mountain if ever I seen one. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, though \xe2\x80\x93 seen one. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re like. Mountains are like that, right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Madeline LeFleur, head of the Night Vale Tourism Board, said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, great, now we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have to reprint all these brochures!\xe2\x80\x9d before taking more sips of her coffee than she needed to in a given span of time \xe2\x80\x93 because the frequency of sips was under her control, and her own life was not.\n\n\n John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard form him in a while. If anyone knows where he went, or about the Blinking Light up on the Mountain, or the Mountain rising up out of this muddy plain outside of town, please call in to the station and release the information with your mouth.\n\n\n As part of our service to our community, Night Vale Community Radio is taking this moment to allow one of the candidates for mayor to make a brief statement. The following is from the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home:\n\n\n\n\n I replaced your books with other books. The covers are the same, but the content has been altered. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you read enough, but that is not why I did it. I changed every single word of some of the books, in others only a single comma on a single page. This is a metaphor, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6not sure what it represents. That is also a metaphor.\n\n\n We all are.\n\n\n Our political system has become too complicated. I am not complicated. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a gentle old lady who lives in your home. I\xe2\x80\x99m touching your hand right now.\n\n\n No, not that one.\n\n\n Not that one either.\n\n\n Do not think you are superior because you have a face and I do not. All of your books are now different books and you did not notice. So who is a lost child in the dark howling woods of this fable?\n\n\n Anyway, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for me. One of the books is now my life story, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to know more about my background.\n\n\n No, not that one.\n\n\n Not that one either.\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99ll know it, because my life story is just like yours \xe2\x80\x93 starting with calamity and shouting, and ending with an empty room and a to-do list.\n\n\n Also, Hiram McDaniels has been exchanging emails with corn lobbyists looking to elbow in on our local imaginary corn market.\n\n\n Hiram: Bad for our community, bad for our interests, literally a five-headed dragon.\n\n\n Vote for the candidate you can trust. Vote for the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home.\n\n\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor:\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast may have been brought to you\xe2\x80\xa6by\xe2\x80\xa6uncertainty.\n\n\n And now, back to our regular programming.\n\n\n Ah-hah! We have some sharp listeners! Several of you noted that the strangeness of today does not end with the Blinking Light up on the Mountain, or the Mountain itself\xe2\x80\xa6but also, this vast, muddy plain it rises from. So yes: we are now reporting that there is a great Floodplain, strewn with bones, around our city.\xc2\xa0Its wet patches glint slightly when the Blinking Light is illuminated.\xc2\xa0At night, when all distance is darkness, it appears that the universe itself is glimmering red, and then gone. Red \xe2\x80\x93 and then gone.\n\n\n The mud ripples under the footsteps of the approaching Masked Army, and this warps the reflections in interesting ways.\n\n\n Carlos says he would like to study it, but that he promised to make a certain person dinner, and he has to learn how to put other things besides science first. Some of this realization might have come with help from those around him.\n\n\n Mayor Pamela Winchell was seen holding her official mayoral bloodstone aloft towards the Mountain, and the Blinking Light upon it. She was standing on that plain \xe2\x80\x93 the plain that exists now, which we should have mentioned earlier.\n\n\n In other news, a Man in a Tan Jacket, carrying a deerskin suitcase, was seen outside of one of the currently-closed subway entrances, passing out flyers explaining the benefits of a mass-transit system, and encouraging citizens to push for the reopening of the subway as soon as possible.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cTransit is the opposite of traffic!\xe2\x80\x9d the flyer reportedly said, and \xe2\x80\x9cSubway? More like WOWZA!\xe2\x80\x9d Some citizens reported that the flyer went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cTransverse the navel of the world, that secret buried point. It is my home. Help me get home. It is already too late to be early, but not too late to be on time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Here at the station, we can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm any of this, as those holding the flyer soon found that it had vanished from their hands. That they could barely remember their interaction with the man. And that, looking back, all they saw was a haze of dust and heat \xe2\x80\x93 distant, and indecipherable \xe2\x80\x93 like a country they\xe2\x80\x99d never live to visit. Like the landscape of a fading dream. Like fiction.\n\n\n Like fiction.\n\n\n All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re really gonna get it right this time. We have been focusing too narrowly, and we realize that. As many of you pointed out, we should have spent less time on the blinking light, and more time expanding on the bit about the approaching Masked Army.\n\n\n So: there is now a great Masked Army coming towards us across the bone-covered plain. We have no specific information about them, other than that they look small when far away, and then appear to grow as they come closer, which they are \xe2\x80\x93 coming closer.\n\n\n They also might actually be growing. They are quite large now.\n\n\n The Blinking Light up on the Mountain has not changed its pace. There is a noise like growling, only less organic \xe2\x80\x93 like wind howling through a canyon, only more\xe2\x80\xa6growl-y.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, here is what we know:\n\n\n \n There is a Blinking Light up on the Mountain.\n\n\n There is a Mountain on the Floodplain.\n\n\n There is a Floodplain under the Imminent Army.\n\n\n There is an Imminent Army maybe a couple of hours\xe2\x80\x99 march from here.\n\n\n\n I do not believe, now, that we are leaving anything out.\n\n\n If you have homes, I suggest you flee them. If you have friends, I suggest you warn them. If you have children\xe2\x80\xa6did you not know how dangerous and unpredictable the world was when you created a defenseless, tiny human within it?\n\n\n And, much like\xc2\xa0Madeline LeFleur, head of Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s Tourism Board, I will now control the one part of my life that is under my control \xe2\x80\x93 let us go now (and I do hope we come back), to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cNever Be Famous\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0Hussalonia]\n\n\n Well, we did come back. Here we are, post-weather.\n\n\n Carlos finally took a look at the situation: the Blinking Light up on the Mountain, and all that came with it \xe2\x80\x93 horrific Invading Army, et cetera.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gesturing with a spatula he had, until moments before, been using to cook. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mirage. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that one before. When you get the clouds a certain way, and the temperature is where it\xe2\x80\x99s at, you can sometimes get this\xe2\x80\xa6blinking-light-mountain-floodplain-masked-army mirage. Wow! This is a pretty strong one! It should disappear in an hour or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And it did! Completely gone! Well\xe2\x80\xa6the mountain and the blinking light and the floodplain disappeared. The Masked Army turned out to be real. But they weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming to attack us, just passing through on their way to attacking someone else.\xc2\xa0And they provided some\xc2\xa0valuable\xc2\xa0traffic for local business. A few of them even took a bus tour of Radon Canyon.\n\n\n Madeline LeFleur was both relieved and pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m relieved,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m also pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d She was still sipping her coffee too often. Perhaps her feeling of lack of control stems from a personal issue, rather than the impending doom we imagined. Stress from her failure to live up to her own self-imposed life goals, for instance. Or a relationship that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the relationship she had envisioned it would be.\n\n\n But who knows? No one. No one has ever known anything, not really.\n\n\n Still,\xc2\xa0nonetheless, we have come to another end. We have come to it as we always do: blind, ignorant, groping\xe2\x80\xa6I take comfort in that consistency.\n\n\n There is no blinking light up on the mountain, there is no mountain towering over a muddy plain, there is no muddy plain under an Invading Army.\n\n\n There was an Invading Army, but they\xe2\x80\x99re gone now.\n\n\n What is left? Well, what is always left?\n\n\n Night Vale. Our little city. our tiny town, our Night Vale. Proud. Safe. Existent.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for the background hum of the universe \xe2\x80\x93 amplified, and with live color commentary.\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Throw your hands in the air. Now your arms. Keep detaching limbs and throwing them in the air. Hopefully the birds will be sated, and leave.'
