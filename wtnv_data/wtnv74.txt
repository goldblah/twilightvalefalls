64 - WE MUST GIVE PRAISE
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge a book by its cover. Judge it by the harmful messages it\ncontains.\n\n \nWelcome to Night Vale.\n\n \nThe enormous glowing cloud that serves as president of the Night Vale\nSchool Board announced a five-year strategic plan for the school\ndistrict. The plan, put together over the past year by the\ntwelve-member board, lays out new curriculum goals, organizational\nrestructuring, and a comprehensive outline for eternal penitence\nbefore the Mighty Glow Cloud.\n\n \nEveryone present at the press conference fell to their knees and\npraised the Glow Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 their eyes solid white, gray smoky wisps\nswirling from their chanting mouths, hands clapping loudly in unison\n\xe2\x80\x93 as miniature glowing colorful clouds swept about them.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cCHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE!\xe2\x80\x9d the Glow Cloud said. \xe2\x80\x9cWE\nMUST GIVE PRAISE! GIVE OUR LIVES! GIVE OUR ALL TO THE CHILD OF THE\nGLOWING CLOUD! TO THE SCION OF INCORPOREAL RULE! ALL HAIL! ALL HAIL!\nALL HAIL!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nThe crowd chanted along in worship of the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s child, who is\ncurrently a freshman at Night Vale High School. The young cloud is an\nactive member of both Show Choir and the Speechless Debate team.\nTheir education has long been an important part of the adult Glow\nCloud\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in the education community.\n\n \nThe Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police, in conjunction with several Vague, Yet\nMenacing, Government Agencies, are calling on all citizens to be on\nthe lookout for two fugitives. Both Hiram McDaniels and the Faceless\nOld Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home are wanted by authorities\nfor their recent attempts to usurp mayoral control of Night Vale.\n\n \nHiram is described as literally a five-headed dragon. He is 18\nfeet tall, and his heads are colored blue, green, gold, gray, and\npurple. They each have their own personality, sentience, memory, and\ndistinct markings and features.\n\n \nThe gray head often feels blue, and wears a green nose ring. The blue\nhead considers logic the gold standard of intellect, and has purple\neyes. The gold head is actually more of a sable, and will talk \xe2\x80\x98til\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s blue in the face. The purple head has grown gray with paranoid\nfantasies and wears a gold neck chain that has a pendant with the\nword \xe2\x80\x9cViolet\xe2\x80\x9d written in green gemstones. And the green head is\nthe real shouty one that wants to set everyone on fire, all the time.\n\n \nThe Secret Police are also on the hunt for the Faceless Old Woman,\nwhom they describe as \xe2\x80\x9can elderly female without a face \xe2\x80\x93\nalthough, no one has ever actually seen her, so we\xe2\x80\x99re all just\nguessing. But, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know you\xe2\x80\x99re near her if you\xe2\x80\x99re at home.\nParticularly if you\xe2\x80\x99re home alone and it\xe2\x80\x99s dark, and you think you\nhear breathing and creaking steps in another room. Under no\ncircumstances should you look. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look. You will not at all\nlike what you see,\xe2\x80\x9d the Secret Police said.\n\n \nThere is a reward for information leading to the arrest of either of\nthese fugitives. That reward is a gift card to Pier 1, a lifetime of\ngratitude, and a couple of handwritten coupons for things like\nwashing the dishes, or a ten-minute back rub.\n\n Um,\na couple of listeners have asked how my boyfriend Carlos is doing.\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s still working on lots of interesting science projects in that\ndesert otherworld. It\xe2\x80\x99s been almost a year since I last saw him in\nperson, and I miss him a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to hear back from Station\nManagement about getting vacation time so I can go visit him. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nnearly impossible to get approved for vacation and, even if you do,\nyou never know when or how you will find out.\n\n At\nmost businesses, you just file some simple paperwork or ask your\ndirect supervisor, and after a few days they have someone from Human\nResources hide in the back seat of your car, and when you\xe2\x80\x99re halfway\nhome they grab your face from behind, covering your eyes with one\nhand and mouth with the other and shout \xe2\x80\x9cYour vacation has been\napproved, congratulations!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, in your excitement, you take\nthem out for ice cream.\n\n But\nnot in community radio. You can wait weeks, or months, to hear back.\nIn the meantime, though, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking up watercolors again, and I\ndid something I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done for anyone else I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been with. I\npainted a picture of Carlos. He\xe2\x80\x99s in profile, looking across his\ndesert otherworld, he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing his Karl Lagerfeld-designed lab coat,\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s a car-sized Bichon Fris\xc3\xa9 atop a dune behind him.\n\n And\nit might be the best painting I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever made. I had long given up\nthis old hobby, and lately I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown so\xe2\x80\xa6oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6out of\ntouch? Lost? Disconnected? I just needed something to occupy my time.\n\n Anyway,\nI hung it above my desk, near the window, and I tell you, it really\ngets me through the days, seeing my pastel Carlos in his brush-swept\notherworld paradise.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\ntake a look now at the Community Calendar.\n\n Thursday\nnight, Dark Owl Records will be holding an open mic for anyone who\npromises not to play any music, perform any poetry or comedy, or\nproduce any kind of art at all. Dark Owl owner Michelle Nguyen says\nshe hopes to not have to listen to or see any more art for as long as\nshe lives, which she is sure will be for a really long time.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\ntaking forever,\nthis life!\xe2\x80\x9d Nguyen said, before inserting an AOL Free Internet for\n30 Days disc into her antique CD player. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the only thing I\ncan listen to anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Nguyen added.\n\n Friday\nmorning, the Society for a Blood Space War will be traveling back in\ntime and eliminating several future enemies before they gain training\nand grow powerful. According to the group\xe2\x80\x99s press kit, Friday is the\nofficial day of the event, but since they\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling back in\ntime, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of moot because they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\nthat they recently hired a new PR manager, and he\xe2\x80\x99s being all, like,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t announce an event without a date.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Anyway,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll have preemptively assassinated all future enemy leaders by\nFriday morning.\n\n Well,\nthis certainly explains the people in space suits who broke into our\nbreak room here at the station last week and started a laser knife\nbattle with two folks from finance and our new intern, Hannah Reff \xe2\x80\x93\nwho, it turns out, had some pretty sick laser knife fighting skills.\nThe finance folks went down easy, but Hannah managed to fight two of\nher attackers off before the three remaining intruders grabbed her\nand jumped en sacrificial masse into the temporary black hole they\nhad created near the coffee maker, thus ending Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s future reign\nof space terror.\n\n To\nthe family of intern Hannah, she was a very good intern. Very\nfocused, and always a friendly presence here in the office. She was\nalso a future warlord in the Blood Space War, but\xe2\x80\xa6you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nknown that. Only Hannah could have. She will be missed.\n\n Where\nwas I? Oh. *Ahem*\n\n Saturday\nafternoon on the Great Lawn is the Ennui Fair, sponsored by the Last\nBank of Night Vale. There will be some pouty clowns, indifferent to\nsimplistic balloon shapes of dogs. There will be local merchants and\nartisans, standing hopelessly in small lots where they should be\nsetting up booths to showcase their wares, but can\xe2\x80\x99t bring themselves\nto do so because they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the thread\xe2\x80\xa6not just of the fair, but\nof their careers and lives.\n\n Organizers\nsay they expect cold rain that day, so you should\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n And\nthen their press release just trails off.\n\n Sunday,\nall day, is the First Annual Ultimate Frisbee Tournament at the\nSoftball and Field Hockey Grounds, which were discovered last fall by\narchaeologists over near the Olive Garden in the Problematic Birds\nDistrict. The archaeologists determined this ancient site was built\nover four years ago by natives of this town, who enjoyed outdoor\nactivities like amateur softball and field hockey.\n\n Tuesday\nAfternoon is a pretty decent classic rock song.\n\n It\nhas just been reported to me that the Night Vale PTA is upset about\nthe strategic plan created by the Night Vale School Board. Gordon\nMoreno, president of the PTA, issued a statement criticizing the\nSchool Board for not consulting parents and teachers when crafting\nthese changes.\n\n Joined\nby treasurer Diane Creighton, whose son Josh is a 9th grader at NVHS,\nand secretary\xe2\x80\xa6Steve Carlsberg\xe2\x80\xa6whose stepdaughter Janice is in 2nd\ngrade, Moreno said the school board once again showed its lack of\ncare for parental input into the education and development of its\nstudents.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cParent\xe2\x80\x99s\nvoices must be heard,\xe2\x80\x9d Moreno shouted from atop the statue of\nimmortal film actor Lee Marvin. Sitting on Marvin\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, legs\ndangling like a denim-wrapped flesh scarf from the bronze sculptures\nmuscular neck, Moreno called for more transparency in education\nplanning.\n\n Moreno\nthen clenched his teeth and lips and eyes as he kicked his legs back\nand forth in a groaning, full body tantrum.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\ntake a look at financial news.\n\n 2,921\nis a number. Which is up from many other numbers, definitely up, so\nyou should get really excited\xe2\x80\xa6or, perhaps, really upset over this.\n\n Also,\nthe following words: Crime, debt, capital, offering, and portfolio.\nWrite those down and learn what they mean. Do not remember anything\nthat you learn, but seek the memory of what you learn in dreams.\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s\nanother number: 9.8 billion. That\xe2\x80\x99s a very large number, one of the\nlargest\nnumbers. Loosen your jaw and breathe in slowly through your nose when\nyou hear a number like that. 9.8 billion. That\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbillion,\xe2\x80\x9d with\ntwo Ls. Billion.\nWow!\n\n This\nhas been financial news.\n\n John\nPeters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 called today to say he noticed\nthat Frank Chen has returned to town.\n\n Some\nof you recall that Frank went missing a while back, and a little over\ntwo years ago his body was found by four kids who followed a railroad\ntrack. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s body was covered in extensive claw marks and burns,\nmost likely caused \xe2\x80\x93 according to the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s report \xe2\x80\x93 by a\nlarge dragon.\n\n Anyway,\nJohn said he\xe2\x80\x99s seen Frank driving around town in his pickup truck,\ndoing some freelance construction work with a focus on carpentry and\nrestoration, just like he always did when he was alive. John said\nFrank looks good.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\nreal tall now. And rotund,\xe2\x80\x9d John said from atop a telephone pole,\nwhere he\xe2\x80\x99d jimmied up a phone directly into the active lines. \xe2\x80\x9cGot\na tail and bunch of colorful heads now. Also he got one of them\ncrossover toolboxes and a class 4 adjustable hitch for his truck,\xe2\x80\x9d\nJohn said, sounding impressed.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nguess death isn\xe2\x80\x99t the end,\xe2\x80\x9d John added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all have to live on\nin some way. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the legacy we leave, or the memories other\npeople keep of us, or the feeling they have when they hear our names\nor a stolen identity taken by someone still alive. Or just actual\nphysical immortality. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a shame. Whatever it is. Such a damn\nshame, everything is, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen there was a loud buzz, and a staticy pop, and a dial tone. And\nthen a different voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can hang up the phone now,\nCecil.\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOK, Lacy. Fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve\njust received word that the School Board has rejected the PTA\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest for more transparency in long term strategic planning. The\npresident of the School Board and enormous glowing cloud cited School\nDistrict Code 25.3b-2, which states \xe2\x80\x9cALL\nHAIL! ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY GLOW CLOUD! YOU ARE WEAK! YOU ARE NOTHING!\nYOU MUST BOW DOWN AND GIVE PRAISE TO THE GLOW CLOUD!\xe2\x80\x9d\nas well as Code 17.2a, which explicitly defines the powers of the\nSchool Board President as \xe2\x80\x9cOMNIPOTENT!\nOMNISCIENT! OBSTREPEROUS! INFINITE!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what it says. It even has that reverb effect\nwhen you read it.\n\n PTA\npresident Moreno, knowing he had very little leverage in his request\nfor power of legislative review, decided to change his strategy into\na request for forgiveness from the angry pulsing cloud. Animals began\nfalling from the sky with heavy thumps and splats and splashes. The\nGreat Lawn has grown dark with carcasses and shadows as PTA officers\nrun in search of cover.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nheard from my friend, Diane Creighton, that she huddled underneath\nthe Lee Marvin statue, and that the lifelike bronze form of our\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest living actor has done a tremendous job of blocking\nthe various black bears and nurse sharks and ostriches falling so\nviolently to Earth.\n\n The\nGlow Cloud has spread wide across the sky, blotting out important\nthings like spy satellites and helicopters, as well as unimportant\nthings like the moon and the illusions of mountains near the horizon.\nFrom right here in the studio, I can see the darkness spreading. It\nlooks like this is as good a time as any to take you to the weath\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n What\nwas that? What the\xe2\x80\xa6was that?\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\nTrans Soul Rebel\xe2\x80\x9d by Against\nMe!]\n\n The\nSchool Board and the PTA have reached a compromise. The PTA\xe2\x80\x99s earlier\ngrievance that long-term curriculum and school district planning\nlacked transparency has been heard. And while the Glow Cloud and the\nSchool Board could not offer complete openness and inclusion in all\nschool district decisions for the PTA, they could offer to stop\ndropping dead animals on everyone, if the PTA never mentioned\ntransparency or questioned authority again.\n\n PTA\npresident Moreno agreed to these terms, panting, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah. Oh, yeah,\nsure. Never again. Please, just let us be. Please!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nhe breathlessly repeated \xe2\x80\x9cALL HAIL, ALL HAIL, ALL HAIL,\xe2\x80\x9d as thick\nresidue of some fallen beast dripped slowly off his swollen face and\nonto his torn shirt.\n\n Diane\nCreighton, safe beneath the Lee Marvin statue, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps a\nPTA liaison on the School Board would be\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d but Moreno jumped in.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\nNo liaison. We are fine, Diane, we must give praise!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nDiane didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. But she said a lot. Moreno did not\nacknowledge the look in Diane\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n Steve\nCarlsberg then added\xe2\x80\xa6oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\nhe added something.\nSteve always does.\n\n I\nhope you are all safe, dear listeners. I hope you are all OK. I know\nI am safe.\n\n Sadly,\nthough, I am not OK. The falling animal carcasses collapsed a small\nsection of the outer wall around our radio station. No one was\ninjured, but it was the wall where my desk was. My new painting. I\nhad spent so long on it. I mean, I can replace it, but\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just\nthat. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6just that it brought me such happiness, such a reason to\nget up, such little joys.\n\n Like,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to find images of Carlos, we have science,\nwith its phones and screens and psychic projections, and\xe2\x80\xa6but that\npicture [exasperated\nsigh]\nit was art. Creation. Destroyed. I mean, I can paint another. I can.\nI can just paint another.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe fine. Just an excuse to do some fun painting. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re all\nOK. Diane\xe2\x80\x99s OK, even Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad he\xe2\x80\x99s OK too, I can just paint\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nfine.\n\n Yup.\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the quiz show Ask Me Another But I\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Talk, You\nFiend, I\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Talk. It\xe2\x80\x99s our most popular new program.\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring a gun to a knife fight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring a knife\nto a knife fight, either. Stop going to knife fights altogether.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your deal with knife fights?'
