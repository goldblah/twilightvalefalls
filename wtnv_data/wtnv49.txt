Episode 45 - A Story About Them
b"\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a story about them,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man on the radio. And you are concerned, because this is not a story you were ever supposed to hear.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n This is a story about them.\n\n\n They sit in a car, much like your own, perhaps. Do you drive a black sedan with tinted windows, into which innocent people disappear forever? Then it is very, very much like your own.\n\n\n There are two men in the car. The man who is not tall watches a house through the window. He makes no attempt to hide what he is doing.\n\n\n The car is similarly clear about its existence.\n\n\n What they do is secret, but there is no need to hide it. Not in this town.\n\n\n For instance: this day, the radio has just started narrating what they do as they do it, for all to hear.\n\n\n The man who is not tall glances down at the radio. Not annoyed, or concerned, or afraid. He just looks at it, because that is what his eyes do right then. And then he looks back at the house, as the man on the radio says that he looks back at the house.\n\n\n The one who is not short is supposed to be watching the house as well. Four eyes are better than two, seven eyes are better than three, and so on. But he is not watching the house. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking down at a crossword puzzle, on which he has just written, \xe2\x80\x9cTEETH\xe2\x80\x9d for the fifth time. This iteration fits neatly into the horizontal of another.\n\n\n He considers the crossword for a long moment. His partner only considers the house.\n\n\n He, the one with the crossword, turns to the other and begins to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a five letter word for the discreet bone structures attached\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But he is cut off.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d says the one who is not tall.\n\n\n They exit the car and approach a man who is leaving his house. The man does not appear surprised to see them. People rarely are.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this.\xe2\x80\x9d He says, but he leaves a period at the end of the sentence, not a question mark.\n\n\n They take the man and put a blindfold over his eyes, and they put him in the car.\n\n\n This is not a story about the man. You don\xe2\x80\x99t care about him.\n\n\n The two men and the car, along with the other blindfolded man, leave Coyote Corners \xe2\x80\x93 a quiet development of old tract homes \xe2\x80\x93 the same way they had come: openly, not-thought-about, feared, secret.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of inviting you to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d says the one who is not short.\n\n\n He often voices what he is thinking of doing, and rarely does any of those things.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThat would have been nice,\xe2\x80\x9d says the one who is not tall.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it would have been,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, a tad dreamily perhaps. That is not an adverb that is supposed to crop up in a car of this description. Few adverbs are.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmMMMmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man with the hood over his head.\n\n\n Forget him. This is a story about them.\n\n\n That part of their work done, they drive to the Moonlite All-Nite Diner. It is not night, but the neon is on \xe2\x80\x93 an insubstantial wisp of green in a larger insubstantial wisp of blue.\n\n\n They are narrated along by the radio, until the man who is not tall turns it off.\n\n\n In the parking lot, the man who is not short looks up.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey, what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he says, indicating the clear nothing of the sky.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is what?\xe2\x80\x9d says the other.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI saw something,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a moment. Just there, for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n He points again. Again, there is nothing. There couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been less.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d continues the man who is not short, but he does not say what he is sure it was.\xc2\xa0The man who is not tall considers his partner for a moment, and shakes his head.\n\n\n Inside the diner, inside a booth, after menus and waters, they dig into matching turkey clubs.\n\n\n The diner smells like rubber and bread. The man on the radio tells them this quietly, from staticky speakers set into a foam tile ceiling.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRead any good books lately?\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d says the other.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d says the first.\n\n\n Bites of sandwich, bits of time.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done the living room in a different color,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, who is not short. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one color, it is now different. I hope that I will feel differently as a result.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHmm,\xe2\x80\x9d says the first. He never knows what to say to things like that. He wishes he did. He offers the man who is not short some fries instead, to indicate what he feels about their friendship, but cannot say.\n\n\n The man who is not short eats a couple. He knows what the man who is not tall means by offering the fries, because they have worked together a long time. And also because the radio explained it to him, just then.\n\n\n Outside, the blindfolded man sits in the car, the desert heat trapped within by the glass.\n\n\n Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\n\n\n After lunch, the three men drive to the industrial part of town, which was set aside by the City Council to be the industrial part of town some time ago.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Council said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis area around here will be pretty industrial. Warehouses, and factories, and things like that. Some graffiti, and chain-link fences.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n They cut a ribbon that they were carrying with them. The Council always carries a ribbon for that purpose.\n\n\n The car pulls into a warehouse. The radio is back on, and still talking about them.\n\n\n The warehouse is cavernous, and full of crates. Some of them tick, others do not. They form an angled hillscape of corners and flats, up and away in every direction.\n\n\n The warehouse smells like rotting wood and dryer sheets.\n\n\n Their supervisor waits for them, with crossed arms and a cross expression.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cA disgrace!\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you something,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, and says nothing more.\n\n\n The two men indicate the blindfolded man in the back seat of the car.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAhh! Ahhhh,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, waving vaguely at the blindfolded man. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone has to be to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, pointing at everything but herself.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe take buildings from the miniature city we discovered under the bowling alley, we put them in crates, we ship the crates out to various warehouses in the desert, and, as a result, our interests are furthered. It could not be more simple!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The man who is not short is not paying attention. Something has caught his eye. It is so dark and distant, what he sees. It seems like it cannot possibly be real.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey, look at that!\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pointing at what he sees.\n\n\n The man who is not tall and their supervisor look where he is pointing. There is nothing but the ceiling of the warehouse, with some dust and light in between.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d says the supervisor.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Good,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\n\n\n They turn back to each other.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short. He squints up at what he sees. \xe2\x80\x9cI was worried that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good, at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAaaanyway,\xe2\x80\x9d says the supervisor, \xe2\x80\x9cnow the city has declared war in revenge. Although they haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet figured out it was us stealing the buildings \xe2\x80\x93 they just declared a general war, in the name of their god, Huntokhar, on everyone from the \xe2\x80\x98upper world,\xe2\x80\x99 as they call us.\xc2\xa0This war has been raging for almost a year now. People have died, yes, but listen \xe2\x80\x93 people die all the time, for all different kinds of reasons. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry, if I were you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d says the supervisor. She mumbles instructions into a walkie talkie, and a series of 'yes sirs\xe2\x80\x99 and 'no sirs\xe2\x80\x99 and hawk shrieking sounds come in response.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she says when she is done. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that now, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t urgent at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\xc2\xa0He understands the second-most of the three people in the room.\n\n\n And then the voice on the radio coming from the car changes its story. They all notice. They are told by the radio that they are noticing before they notice, because that part of the narration happens before the story changes.\n\n\n Even the man on the radio does not know why he changes the story, or where this other story comes from. He does not always understand everything he does. Sometimes he does understand, but he hides it from you.\n\n\n In any case, here is a new story, one he tells without regard for why he is telling it:\n\n\n Somewhere else, not here, there is a woman wandering a desert \xe2\x80\x93 a desert not unlike this one, but not like this one either \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same desert, I need to clarify that.\n\n\n Also, with her, are great masked warriors \xe2\x80\x93 women and men of enormous size who listen as she speaks, and follow her as she walks. She is winning them over because she has survived so much. She is young, but in her experience she is as lost and scared and ancient as the rest of them.\n\n\n Her feet hurt. They hurt. She keeps walking, and they keep following.\n\n\n Beyond her, no longer just on the horizon, much closer than that, is a light spreading across the desert. The light is alive, and malicious, and vast, and encroaching. It buzzes and shines and everything about it hurts those who are close to it, and destroys those who are within it. It spreads \xe2\x80\x93 not just in the desert I am talking about \xe2\x80\x93 it spreads in different forms, in deserts not unlike it. In deserts very similar to the one I am talking about now. Not always in the same form, not always as light at all, but with the same intent: to devour everything until there is nothing left. It is a Smiling God of terrible power and ceaseless appetite.\n\n\n The woman wanders the desert, followed by the masked warriors. They look back at the light on the horizon, and they know that the time when it will reach their little patch of land is coming, and so many other little patches of land as well.\n\n\n Soon, they will have to turn.\xc2\xa0Soon, they will have to face it head-on.\xc2\xa0And not just that woman and her desert. Not just her at all.\n\n\n The man on the radio returns to the story about them. He does not know how he knew what he just said, or why he would tell it to you. He is innocent, and kind.\n\n\n But anyway, this is a story about them. And so you do not care about anyone but them.\n\n\n They, and their supervisor, are listening with interest to what just happened on the radio. The man who is not tall has taken notes.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll look into that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is exactly as we suspected,\xe2\x80\x9d he does not say. He did not suspect any of that.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone has to be to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d the supervisor says again, gesturing this time directly at the blindfolded man.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI understand completely,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMe too,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short, although he does not understand. He usually does not. His partner understands for him, and it all works out OK.\n\n\n As they leave the warehouse and the supervisor and the piles of wooden crates, the voice on the radio says something about the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPretty Little Head\xe2\x80\x9d by Eliza Rickman]\n\n\n By the time they leave the warehouse, it is night. Or maybe the sun has just set early. The sunrise that morning had been particularly loud and strenuous.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short, looking down at his crossword, \xe2\x80\x9cI worry every time that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to finish these when I start them. The future, where I have finished, seems so distant from the present, where I have started.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you would. I know. I know you would worry about so many things. I do worry about that. About you worrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think everything will turn out all right?\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says to clarify. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says as further clarification.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n He does not.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6do!\xe2\x80\x9d he says again.\n\n\n He does not.\n\n\n He glares at the radio.\n\n\n They drive past the Moonlite All-Nite, a glass box of bad food and good people.\xc2\xa0They pass Teddy Williams\xe2\x80\x99 Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex, badly damaged by the war, but still running its weekly bowling league.\xc2\xa0They pass by City Hall, which is covered in a yellow tarp, stamped with an orange triangle.\xc2\xa0Moving farther out, with absolute purpose, they pass by the Used Car Lot \xe2\x80\x93 alive with the wolves that populate all car lots at night \xe2\x80\x93 and Old Woman Josie\xe2\x80\x99s house, silent and empty for months now.\n\n\n Then the town is behind them, and they are in the Scrub Lands and the Sand Wastes.\n\n\n They stop the car and get out.\xc2\xa0Pebbles crunch in the sand in response to their movement.\xc2\xa0The radio murmurs behind the closed doors of the car.\xc2\xa0The headlights illuminate only a few stray plants and the wide, dumb eyes of some nocturnal animal.\n\n\n The two men don\xe2\x80\x99t look back at Night Vale. They look forward, at the darkness that stretches out as far as anyone here can imagine. Most anyone here tries to imagine as little as possible. There is no need to imagine here.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell, get him out,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall, and the man who is not short opens the rear door of the car and guides the blindfolded man out.\n\n\n The blindfolded man stumbles a little, but not much, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything specific he stumbles on. He stumbles like a stage direction \xe2\x80\x93 like the next in a bulleted list of items.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cPut him over there,\xe2\x80\x9d the man who is not tall says unnecessarily.\n\n\n We all know the drill. We all know how this, and everything else, ends.\n\n\n The blindfolded man walks 15 feet or so in the direction of the darkness, so that the men and the car are between him and the distant dome of light that is Night Vale. He walks to a certain point in the cool sand, and then stops \xe2\x80\x93 partly because the man who is not short guided him there, but mostly because he has taken himself there, as we all eventually take ourselves to that point where we will not be able to take ourselves any farther.\n\n\n The man who is not tall, still by the car, pulls out a knife. It is not stained, does not look used, but he speaks its brutal history in his posture \xe2\x80\x93 in the way he holds it.\n\n\n The blindfolded man breathes normally, his shoulders loose, his covered face slightly down. His feet sink a little in the sand. Behind him, in practical terms as far away as anything has ever been, is the town he is from.\n\n\n The man who is not short, standing next to the blindfolded man, looks up at the sky.\n\n\n The man who is not tall walks up to join them with the knife.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short, pointing at the sky.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is what?\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall, from just behind him.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThat planet up there!\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so dark, and so close! It\xe2\x80\x99s looming! It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6so close! I wonder if I could\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n He reaches up.\n\n\n The man who is not tall makes a gesture with the hand that holds the knife.\n\n\n The man who is not short is no longer reaching up. He is no longer standing up.\n\n\n In many ways, he no longer exists at all.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone has to be to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\n\n\n Or no, he sighs this.\n\n\n Or no, he thinks it out loud, but it comes out more thought than speech.\n\n\n He looks up at a night sky that is absolutely clear of anything but void, and stars, and the occasional meteor, and mysterious lights moving at impossible speeds, and the faint glimmer of spy satellites looking back down from the nothing to the something.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, although not to anyone that still exists and can hear him. He just says it, leaves some undirected words in the hot night air, and then returns to the car.\n\n\n He may be crying. I know if he is or not, but I am choosing not to tell you, because this is private information and you have no real need to know it.\n\n\n The blindfolded man removes his blindfold, and looks down at the man who once was not short, and now is not anything at all.\n\n\n He, the man who can see, is also not short. He follows the man who is not tall to the car. The man, not short, not blindfolded, gets in the passenger seat.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAlways an unpleasant business,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He does not comment further. He does not need to.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLooking forward to working with you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not tall.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe same to you,\xe2\x80\x9d says the man who is not short. \xe2\x80\x9cAhh, the same as well to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n This has been a story about them.\n\n\n The radio moves on \xe2\x80\x93 news, traffic, political opinions, and corrections to political opinions \xe2\x80\x93 but somewhere in the desert there is one person who does not move on. This was also a story about him.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for as long as you can, until you cannot stay tuned anymore.\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Knock, knock. Who\xe2\x80\x99s there? Orange. Orange who? Orange you glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say your mother\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital? I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. Is there anything I can do? Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive you over there. We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave right now. Grab a coat, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little cold out. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry."
