b'Trumpets playing soft jazz from out of the dark desert distance. They come tomorrow. It is too late for us.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Did you know there\xe2\x80\x99s a Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home? It\xe2\x80\x99s true! She\xe2\x80\x99s there now. She\xe2\x80\x99s always there, just out of your sight. Always just out of your sight.\n\n\n Because you cannot see her, you were probably completely unaware that this woman likes to sift through photos of you and your loved ones. She softly touches each face, as if wishing it were her own. Or perhaps claiming it as her own. Or perhaps simply cursing that person. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen her doing this.\n\n\n The Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home does lots of things.\n\n\n Ever wonder why your web browser\xe2\x80\x99s history is filled with Bing searches for \xe2\x80\x93 quote \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cpictures of dead wolves,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x93 quote \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cthe melting point of birds?'
