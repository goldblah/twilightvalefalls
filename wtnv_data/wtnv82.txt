Episode 70B - Review
b"If\nyou love something, set it free. If\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back, it probably died of sadness because it thought\nyou loved it.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\ndifficult to say goodbye to your hometown. Difficult indeed. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\nget to all of that soon, but first we bring you the item of, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsure, most interest to all of you: a review of last night\xe2\x80\x99s opera.\nThe inaugural performance of the New Old Night Vale Opera House, a\ntribute to the building which once stood proudly in this town for\ndecades before succumbing, 20 years ago, to an unchecked puppy\ninfestation.\n\n The\nNew Old Opera House is luxurious and stylish. I had no idea what\nopera was until last night, so my expectations for the building were\npretty low. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\nthink opera is; I was expecting something like fenced-in yards\noccupied full of filthy straw, occupied by hundreds of heavily\ndrugged wolves.\n\n But it\nturns out that opera houses look nothing like petting zoos. This\nplace had a chandelier, and velvet seats, and lush red curtains, and\na snack bar, and\npeople wearing just the fanciest clothes you could imagine. Tuxedos,\nand ball gowns, and balaclavas, and shin guards.\n\n Old\nWoman Josie and all of her tall winged friends who go by the name\nErika and who claim to\nbe angels, were there. They were the driving force behind the\nbuilding of the New Old Opera House. It was only fitting, then, that\nbefore the performance, Josie gave a toast from the stage. She\ntoasted opera, and Night Vale, and all of the donors who made the\nOpera House possible.\n\n Finally,\nshe toasted old friends. And when she did, she looked at me and\ngrinned.\n\n I\nblushed, and looked down at my shoes \xe2\x80\x93 which were tasteful sponge\nclogs that matched my tights perfectly.\n\n OK,\nso, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re asking the same question I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking for\nyears: what even is\nopera? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any training in opera, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to\ndescribe it. Basically, opera is kind of like theater, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t\nraise the curtain all the way up. So you only can see feet shuffling\nabout while you hear high pitched wailing and combustion engines.\n\n This\nparticular opera was called \xe2\x80\x9cAmara.\xe2\x80\x9d It was composed and\nconducted and mostly\nperformed by acting legend Lee Marvin. It was about a young girl who\ngoes on some kind of\xe2\x80\xa6adventure? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear, because opera is\nsuper-interactive and entirely nonlinear. Sometimes people from the\naudience throw old fruit at the stage, and then the actors jump into\nthe audience to wrestle these people. Audience members are encouraged\nto yell out things they think the performers should do, and\nperformers often vocalize their distaste for the audience.\n\n At one\npoint in the first act I shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cSing a song about old love and\nnew horizons, about wanderlust and uncertainty!\xe2\x80\x9d and then a member\nof the chorus spat at me. And moments later I found someone\nhandcuffed me to my armrest. It was super fun!\n\n They\ndid raise the curtain all the way once, revealing a detailed set of a\nstorm-tossed ocean, upon which a great ship lurched skyward atop a\ncurling monstrous wave. The details of the painting and the carpentry\nwere flawless. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in such awe of a stage set as I was\nthen. But I think the stage manager recognized the error in allowing\nthe audience to see this, and quickly lowered the curtain to just a\ncouple of feet off the floor.\n\n I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize most of the performers because they kept the curtain\nso low, and the stage lights so dim, but I did note that Frank Chen\nwas in the cast, looking every inch the normal human with \xe2\x80\x93 I can\nonly assume \xe2\x80\x93 a normal number of heads.\n\n At the\nstart of the second act, I sensed a blurry motion in my periphery. I\nfelt a cold touch on my chained hand.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNice\nhandcuffs,\xe2\x80\x9d a whisper said. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to save\nyour friend Dana tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I was\nterrified, yes, but like everyone I\xe2\x80\x99m usually\nterrified. I also felt rage. Rage at the Faceless Old Woman\nwhispering behind me. Had she handcuffed me so that I could not save\nmy former intern, my former friend, my current mayor, Dana Cardinal\nfrom whatever evil deeds were coming her way?\n\n I\nlooked up at Mayor Cardinal in her loge box. She was staring straight\nat the stage, focused and stony. And despite all my anger at my old\nfriend \xe2\x80\x93 that she had presumably bought me at a Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nPolice auction last year, and had been using me for the last several\nmonths against my will to protect herself against the five-headed\ndragon Hiram McDaniels and the Faceless Old Woman \xe2\x80\x93 despite all\nthat, I looked at Dana\xe2\x80\x99s face, hoping she would see me pleading for\nher safety.\n\n I want\nto trust and love my friend, and for that moment, I did. And I was\nsorry that the Faceless Old Woman had restrained me so that I could\nnot help her\xe2\x80\xa6even if, this time, I had wanted to.\n\n I\nfollowed the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s gaze toward the stage. The house lights dimmed,\nand the curtain split open. I saw normal human Frank Chen center\nstage, each of his heads huffing and snarling, preparing for his\naria.\n\n As an\naside, I am told this was to be opera\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever quintet aria, but\nhonestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what either of those words even mean.\n\n Actually,\nonly four of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s\nheads were snarling: the gold, green, gray, and blue ones. But his\npurple head was looking right at me. And I felt something familiar,\nbut\xe2\x80\xa6at the same time, something that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. My hand\nstrained against its chain, but there was nothing I could do.\n\n As the\norchestra \xe2\x80\x93 led by and comprised entirely of Lee Marvin and a slide\nwhistle \xe2\x80\x93 swelled, and Frank Chen continued to belch fire and hiss,\nwe all knew something was wrong. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that an aria\nis just a bunch of roars and flames \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert \xe2\x80\x93 but it\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely. Frank Chen then tore off his bow tie, and in\ndoing so revealed he was not five foot, eight inch middle-aged human\nFrank Chen at all, but\nHiram McDaniels, an 18 foot tall five-headed dragon!\n\n Hiram\nleapt into the air above the orchestra seats. I heard a muffled\nscream from above. I looked to the mezzanine and saw Trish Hidge,\ndeputy assistant to Mayor Cardinal, trying to quickly escort the\nmayor away\xe2\x80\xa6but it was too late. I caught a brief glimpse of someone\nI had never seen before. Or, had never seen in my waking life. She\nwas standing just behind Trish and Mayor Cardinal. It was a woman I\nhad once seen in a dream. In my dream she had been underwater, among\ncoral, young and whispering and faceless. And now, in this\nworld, that is very likely not\njust a dream, I saw this same woman. She was old, and shouting, and\nfaceless.\n\n Hiram\nflew up, past the chandelier, toward Dana in the mezzanine, all of\nhis heads focused on their target, teeth bared and angry\xe2\x80\xa6except the\npurple head, which was twisted away, as though trying \xe2\x80\x93 with just\nits neck \xe2\x80\x93 to deflect the course of its body.\n\n At\nthat moment, I felt myself rising against my will. There I was, lot\nnumber 37, being pulled into use once more. I looked up at Dana, but\nshe was not looking back at me at all. She was preparing to defend\nherself, alone.\n\n And\nthen everything went black.\n\n I saw\nnothing. Felt nothing. I was nowhere.\n\n I\nheard a voice. It was\xe2\x80\xa6whiny, and panicked. It told me it was sorry\nto keep using me, that it had bought me at an auction two years back\njust in case.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nnever know what could happen. Nothing can be trusted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nvoice told me it especially didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the other heads it shares a\nbody with, who are always scheming,\nalways making new plans.\nPlus, it was tired of having to commit violent crimes, and\nconsistently living life on the run.\n\n The\nvoice just wanted to settle down. Maybe start a family.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNight\nVale\xe2\x80\x99s such a nice town, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d the voice asked me.\n\n And I\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cHiram? Is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthe voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot all\nof Hiram. Most people call me Purple Head, but I prefer Violet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n Violet\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cOne head couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work against four. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known that a long\ntime. I needed another body. Lot 37 was put up for sale, and the\nother heads were distracted by Lot 38 (a normal human disguise), so I\nbought you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Now, I\nwas furious, of course. I told Violet that I thought Dana had been\ndoing this the whole time. I blamed\nher over and over! \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost a friend because of you,\nViolet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand do you have any idea what it\xe2\x80\x99s like, to\nhave you control me in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nViolet said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only have one-fifth control over my own body. This\nis my life all of the time, carried along against my will by the\nfoolish plans of those closest to me, betrayed by my own limbs, by\nthe beating of my own heart. But\xe2\x80\xa6I am\nsorry. I really am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nneed to fight your own fights,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d Violet said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am giving you back Lot 37. I\ntransfer ownership back to you. You are yours once again. And\nwhatever else happens tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nyou should be,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d\nViolet said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t blame me for losing your friendship with Dana.\nYou were the one who didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust her. That was you, and only you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nhis voice was gone.\n\n I woke\nup on the floor of the opera house, which was dark and empty. I was\nstill handcuffed to a scorched armrest that had been completely\nburned off of the chair itself. Most seats and wall sconces had been\nheavily scorched and destroyed. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if it was Hiram who did\nthat, or\xe2\x80\xa6maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s just the standard aftermath of opera.\n\n I\nwalked outside to the curb, watching the rain in the streetlights. I\nsaw the drops flickering in a puddle below.\n\n I do\nnot like reflections that flicker.\n\n I\nthought of my mother for the first time in a long time. Missed her.\nAnd, same word, different meaning, I missed the opera. And the after\nparty, too. And, same word, both\nmeanings: I miss my friend Dana. I wish I could have\xe2\x80\xa6saved her.\n\n She\nwas gone, and I failed her. No one was around to help with the weight\nof my guilt, or to unchain me from the armrest.\n\n A huge\nstorm was coming through. A rare weather event for the desert. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a report on that night\xe2\x80\x99s weather now.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cAlign\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Aby Wolf]\n\n The\nstorm passed and I began my walk home \xe2\x80\x93 my clothes soaked, my clogs\nnow several sizes larger. The streets were quiet. And I took it all\nin, knowing these were my final days in Night Vale, certain I had\nmade the right decision.\n\n Then I\nsmelled the sandy earth, wet from the storm, and saw the buildings of\nwhat would soon no longer be my town washed clean by the driven rain,\nand I wavered in my certainty.\n\n Lost\nin thought, I failed to hear the car tires on the slick concrete, or\nsee the headlights swinging my shadow across the sidewalk. I heard,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCecil, get in!\xe2\x80\x9d and, like any citizen of Night Vale when ordered\nto get into an ominous unmarked car, I obeyed without thinking.\n\n Inside\nthe black stretch limo, impossibly large inside, were dozens of opera\nsupporters and local celebrities. Old Woman Josie and her tall winged\nfriends named Erika were there. Waiters passed around hors d'oeuvres\nand champagne. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t missed the after party after all.\n\n My\nsister Abby and her husband Steve and my niece Janice were there.\n\n Janice\nthrew her arms around my waist and said, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Cecil, I love the\nopera so much, thanks for the tickets! I love the part where the\ndragon flew out over the audience like whoosh!\nand then it started fighting itself, and the purple head starting\nbiting the other heads, and it was really funny! Then, it flew away,\nout of the theater, and there was a lot of fire, and I thought I saw\nan old lady with no face ran out too, and\xe2\x80\x93 and the mayor was saved,\nand Mr. Lee Marvin sang a beautiful song about all the animals we can\nsee using mirrors, and then it was over! And everyone cheered! And\nopera is so cool! Mom\nsaid you were moving away. Why are you moving away, Uncle Cecil?\nUncle Carlos says you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to move if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to! Will\nyou still come to my birthday party?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Janice\ncontinued chattering, but\xe2\x80\xa6I was dizzy at the name she had just\nsaid. I interrupted her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCarlos?\nJanice, did you say Carlos?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDuh!\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s right over there, Uncle Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n I\nturned, and I saw him. And he was already looking at me.\n\n And I\nstarted to say, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And he\nstarted to say, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen we just hugged. So tightly.\n\n And in\nmy ear, Carlos said, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry I missed the opera. I had to let Kevin\nknow I was returning home, and staying there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And I\njerked my head back and said, \xe2\x80\x9cStaying here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nCarlos said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your home. You belong here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is also my\nhome. I belong here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCarlos,\nanywhere we\xe2\x80\x99re together is home,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. And I repeated it. And\nrepeated it. And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut Carlos, is Night Vale where we should\nlive? Is Night Vale even worth living in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Carlos\nheld my shoulder and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNight Vale is just a name, Cecil. Night\nVale is just the name for an area where everyone you love lives,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about the name. Worry about the everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n Over\nCarlos\xe2\x80\x99 shoulder I saw Dana, my old intern and current mayor in the\ncrowd. She looked at me, but did not smile. I\xe2\x80\xa6struggled to meet her\neyes, which were wary and gracious. Her deputy Trish Hidge circled\nbehind me and removed the handcuff from my wrist with a small key she\nhad pulled from her jacket pocket.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSorry\nwe had to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d Trish said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we wanted you to be safe, to\nnot have your body willed by some other force into a fight you were\nvery clear you wanted no part in. We had to physically hold you out\nof the way so that we could fight this fight on our own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n From\nacross the impossibly large car, Dana winked and finally smiled.\n\n I\nmouthed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand she did not respond, but, still winking a slow strange wink, she\nreceded into the crowd like a distant walker into mist.\n\n At the\nend of the night, the car dropped Carlos and me back home and\xe2\x80\xa6I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think we slept the whole night! Talking about our new old life\ntogether, all these memories and plans! We are back together in our\nhome, and I am back with you in my studio.\n\n My\nfinal show as host of Night Vale Community Radio was to be a review\nof an opera. And that\xe2\x80\x99s still true\xe2\x80\xa6someday. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be this\nopera.\n\n Carlos\nand I are staying in Night Vale for now. I will be back on the air\nwith you again very soon with more news, and more stories\xe2\x80\xa6with more\nopera.\n\n I\nthink Carlos is right. Night Vale isn\xe2\x80\x99t a single unified thing\nthat can love, or be loved. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the name, slapped onto a set of\nborders and rules that some old bureaucrats wearing soft meat crowns\ndevised centuries ago. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t live here anymore! We\ndo!\n\n I\ndo.\n\n And I\ncan make it worth it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just leave it, I have to live\nit! Live it, and make it better! For myself, for Carlos! For my\nfriends. For Abby, and Steve, and Janice, for Old Woman Josie and all\nof the Erikas. For Dana. And for you, listeners.\n\n We\nwill, together, celebrate another homecoming game. We will, together,\nsurvive another street cleaning. We will, together\xe2\x80\xa6well, we will\nsee.\n\n I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t promise I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\nleave you. No one can promise that. But until that moment, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep\nworking on this town, this collective idea, this Night Vale. Whatever\nwe want that name to mean, we can always start over if we have to.\nRededicate ourselves. Do it right.\n\n To\nstart with, the Secret Police have, once again, jailed Hiram\nMcDaniels for his numerous crimes against his fellow citizens.\nAlthough, in recognition of the Violet Head\xe2\x80\x99s valiant struggle\nagainst the other heads and his own contested body, they\xe2\x80\x99ve put a\nsmall hole in the wall that Violet can stick through and be outside\nof the jail walls, since technically he is not under arrest.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for happenstance reconstructed into narrative, and falsely\ninterpreted as having significance.\n\n And as\nalways, goodnight,\nNight Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: You say potato, I\nsay potato. Potato. Potato. Potato. Potato. Potato. Yes, this is very\ngood. Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep going. Potato. Potato. Potato."
