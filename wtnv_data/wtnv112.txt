Episode 93 - Big Sister
b'Find it in your heart. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to\nbreak past the ribs, and then scoop it out. But it\xe2\x80\x99s in there, and\nyou need to find it. Quickly.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n To\nstart the news today, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bake sale this Saturday afternoon at\nNight Vale Elementary. This is to raise money for a new sculpture to\nhonor the great contributions made by the current School Board\npresident, the Glow Cloud.\n\n The\nGlow Cloud is mighty and magnificent! All hail the powerful Gowing\nCloud which rules our every desire, our every action, our very\nexistence! All hail that which did not create us, but can certainly\ndestroy us.\n\n The\nsculpture will serve as a physical manifestation of our fealty to the\nbenevolent (yet oppressive) Cloud, who has helped increase\nstandardized test scores at every school, as well as graduation rates\nat Night Vale High. The Glow Cloud (ALL\nHAIL!) also helped to\nbuild a brand new Fine Arts Center and rehearsal studios for music\nprograms at the junior high, so good work! Well deserved.\n\n In\nunrelated news, several five-headed dragons have been seen around\nNight Vale. Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s most famous five-headed dragon (really the\nonly dragon we know in\nNight Vale) is Hiram McDaniels, who is currently in prison, slated\nfor execution for his attempt to kill Mayor Dana Cardinal.\n\n None\nof these new dragons are Hiram, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all five-headed and quite\nlarge.\n\n My\nintern Kareem reports that the apparent leader of these new dragons\nis Hadassah McDaniels, Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Not sure what their intentions\nare, but\xe2\x80\xa6I bet they\xe2\x80\x99re innocuous. Just some dragons passing\nthrough!\n\n Kareem\nargues that their intentions seem rather sinister. For instance, they\nnearly burned down the Pinkberry by the mall.\n\n You\nknow, a few weeks ago I asked for mochi on my order at that\nPinkberry, and they put crushed peanuts on\nit, as if anybody likes that garbage? So, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Innocuous,\nsinister\xe2\x80\xa6six one way, half a dozen the other, 1.5 times 4 another\nway.\n\n Listeners,\ncan I just take a moment to thank our intrepid intern Kareem? He\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeen at the station for a long time, a dedication few of our interns\nhave ever shown. In fact, most radio interns leave in the first few\nweeks, never to be heard from again. Not Kareem! He\xe2\x80\x99s truly loyal to\nthis station and to his radio dreams. I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a long\ncareer ahead of him.\n\n Haha!\nKareem is cocking his head and raising one eyebrow at me. Kind of a\nface-based thumbs-up, I suppose.\n\n Ha!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Kareem!\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a look now at sports.\n\n The\nNight Vale High School Scorpions kick off their season this Friday\nnight at Memorial Stadium against the Pine Cliff Lizard Monitors.\nNight Vale\xe2\x80\x99s new quarterback, sophomore Mallory Willingham, won the\nstarting job over junior Henry Lexington, who really struggled last\nyear with some of the basic concepts of throwing\xe2\x80\xa6like which arm to\nuse.\n\n In\nthe season finale last December, Lexington brought a third arm he\nfound in the vacant lot out back of the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s. He used that arm to\nthrow for five touchdowns in a victory over the Stone Meadow Shark\nNurses. But even with this impressive finale, coach Nazr al-Mujaheed\nsaid he preferred the consistency Willingham brought to the position.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWillingham\nhas great vision!\xe2\x80\x9d coach al-Mujaheed said, while crouching behind a\nlarge cardboard box in the corner of his office. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can see\nthings no one else can!\xe2\x80\x9d the coach screamed, his body quivering.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can see your soul, right into it!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe whispered, while still screaming.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoming! Hide! She\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly, as he barricaded\nhis office by hammering wood planks over the door.\n\n Willingham\nsounds like just what this team needs to make the playoff once again.\n\n Tim\nLangley, head of the Night Vale chapter of the NRA, announced today\nsome changes to their charter, saying that, from now on, the NRA will\nno longer use the words gun, rifle, pistol, semi-automatic, or\nrevolver. Instead, those words (and related words) will be replaced\nby the word \xe2\x80\x9ckitten.\xe2\x80\x9d As in \xe2\x80\x9cKittens don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, people\nkill people\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGoing down, kittens a-blazing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwell,\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re holding a kitten to my head\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Langley\nsaid the word \xe2\x80\x9cgun\xe2\x80\x9d carries too many negative connotations, while\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9ckitten\xe2\x80\x9d does not. Langley stressed the importance of\npositive language when attempting to rally a public behind an\norganization with such monstrous political beliefs.\n\n Langley\nand the NRA then distributed flyers across town that read, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nlet the government take our kittens!\xe2\x80\x9d which caused several excited\nresidents to call City Hall. They demanded to know whether the\ngovernment truly planned to come to their homes and take away their\nkittens. Because, the residents said, their cat just had a bunch of\nkittens, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble finding homes for them. So, if\nthe government wants to take some kittens, please,\nby all means, come to our house and take them!\n\n This\nthen excited the members of the City Council, who apparently eat\nkittens. They ruched out, answering every call for kittens. But then,\nupon seeing that many of the residents who had kittens also had guns\nin their homes, well the City Council ordered the guns removed.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve lost our appetite for kittens,\xe2\x80\x9d the Council snarled in\nunison. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re now entering every home in Night Vale and taking\naway your guns.\n\n An\nupdate on the dragons:\n\n Kareem\nscored a prison interview with Hiram McDaniels. Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold, green,\nblue, and gray heads have been sentenced to death for trying to kill\nMayor Cardinal. According to Kareem, Hiram has been shackled inside a\nlarge stone room. Just outside his barred window, Hiram can see\nprison guards inflating colorful mylar balloons that read, \xe2\x80\x9cExecution\nDay\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCongrats\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLordy, Lordy, Guess Who\xe2\x80\x99s 40?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x93 but \xe2\x80\x9c40?\xe2\x80\x9d has been crossed out and replaced with a\nhand-written \xe2\x80\x9cBeing Terminated!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n His\nviolet head will be spared, since he did not participate in the\nattack on the mayor \xe2\x80\x93 and, in fact, thwarted the assassination\nattempt. Just last month, Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head received the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s\nBlack Heart Medal for Bravery and Service to the Community. Sheriff\nSam themself pinned it right onto Violet\xe2\x80\x99s thick scaly skin.\n\n Kareem\nreports that in spite of his pending execution, Hiram is in good\nspirits. Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head told Kareem, \xe2\x80\x9cSon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot some plans in the works. Some really smart plans.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Hiram\nwinked four times, with one eye on each of his hour heads up for\nexecution.\n\n Violet\ndid not wink, only glowered, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll never work!\nThe government will find out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head snarled, \xe2\x80\x9cComplaining is not a strategy! We need\nsolution-based contributions!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Kareem\nasked Hiram if these plans involved inviting his sister and all the\nother dragons into town. Hiram went silent.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\xa6now,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it at all!\xe2\x80\x9d his gold head replied.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot logical! It makes no sense for her to be here,\xe2\x80\x9d Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s blue\nhead stated.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNight\nVale is doomed, but I am too, so who cares?\xe2\x80\x9d his gray head\nconcluded.\n\n More\non this as it develops. But first, a word from our sponsor.\n\n Draw\na rectangle on your wall. Make it a big rectangle, wider than it is\ntall. Put it at eye level, across from your sofa. Then color it in,\nall black. A big, black rectangle on your wall.\n\n Now\nerase the black coloring and then draw a picture \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s say, of\nNathan Fillion from the TV show Castle.\nNext to him, draw the actor Molly Quinn, who plays his daughter\nAlexis on the show.\n\n You\nlike Castle. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\ngood show. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say it\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite scene from Castle where Rick\nand Alexis reconcile their differences after an important court case.\n\n So,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re talking to each other. Rick is about to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Okay.\nGot that? Now, erase that and draw the same scene again, only they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nmoved ever-so-slightly Rick is just beginning to open his mouth now.\n\n Got\nit? Good.\n\n No\nerase that and do it again, Rick\xe2\x80\x99s mouth slightly more open as he\nbegins the first sound of the word \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe draw Alexis\ngently lowering her eyes to receive his statement, still a bit unsure\nabout what is to come.\n\n Keep\ndoing that: erasing and redrawing frame by frame, each fraction of a\nsecond, until you have fully animated the scene.\n\n Time\nconsuming, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Perhaps you should get a Samsung smart TV. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\nflicker all these images and stories at you without you even having\nto move! No offense, but we\xe2\x80\x99re much faster at it than you are. Also,\nNathan Fillion looks nothing like that. Did you think we said Nathan\nLane? I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a talented actor too, but he was never\non Castle. Were you thinking of Modern Family? We bet you were\nthinking of Modern Family\n\n Samsung.\nStop drawing on your wall!\n\n Intern\nKareem says he has seen Hadassah in downtown near City Hall,\naccompanied by several other multi-headed dragons. She\xe2\x80\x99s a full ten\nfeet taller than Hiram, and like Hiram, Hadassah has exactly five\nheads. But instead of being several different colors, each are green.\nEach one shouts simultaneously (overlapping, though; not in unison),\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me my brother!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI will crush your human skulls in\nmy claws!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a knife, this\nis a knife!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, arcing toward the sky, a great breath of\nfire \xe2\x80\x93 which Kareen said did not resemble a knife at all.\n\n Just\nan aside, listeners, Kareem has always been a bit of a cynic. He used\nto say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think Hiram McDaniels wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a five-headed\ndragon, but an elaborate metaphor I made up for a dangerous man. A\nstrange point of view for a young man who openly acknowledges the\nexistence of angels, so\xe2\x80\xa6I hope he understands now\nthat Hadassah\xe2\x80\x99s knife comment was a metaphor. The dragons themselves\nare a literality.\n\n Anyway,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s good that these young interns get a chance to see the world for\nthemselves, rather than just in textbooks and classrooms. I do hope\nthat Kareem is getting a lot lot out of the\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6And\nI just got word from Kareem that he thinks he broke his ankle diving\nout of the way of Hadassahs\xe2\x80\x99s flaming breath as she stormed towards\nCity Hall.\n\n I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t use metaphors lightly, Kareem. Dragons are real,\nyoung man!\n\n Mayor\ncardinal and Sheriff Sam have appeared on the steps of City Hall.\n\n Kareem,\nwho is trying ti maintain consciousness in the face of crippling\npain, says they are confronting Hadassah directly. Dana is extending\nan open palm as a welcoming show of peace. Sam is clenching their\nshotgun and shouting at the dragons, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your wig on, you\novergrown salamanders!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Behind\nthem, a large cloud \xe2\x80\x93 glowing and rumbling, dropping dead animals.\nALL HAIL! a few of the dragons are whispering upon seeing the cloud\napproach.\n\n But\nnot Hadassah.\n\n Dana\nis waving a hand to both Sam and the Glow Cloud to stand down, bu the\ndragons are closing in on her.\n\n Listeners,\nhas Hadassah come to finish what Hiram started? I told Kareem to get\nout of there (but also to get closer to the action \xe2\x80\x93 really try to\nget that story) but also to gt very far away.\n\n As\nwe wait to learn Dana\xe2\x80\x99s fate, let me take you know to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cMary\nOn a Wave\xe2\x80\x9d by Okkervil River]\n\n Kareem\nhas gotten himself to the hospital to get his ankle looked at. Seems\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be in a cast for a few weeks, but fortunately, before\nhe passed out from the pain, he managed to get a report of what\nhappened at City Hall.\n\n Mayor\nCardinal stepped toward Hadassah and welcomed her to the city. Dana\nwas cautious, and graceful.\n\n Hadassah\nsneered at Sam and their shotgun, until Dana told Sam to lower the\nweapon. Hadassah screamed at Dana, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not come in peace. We com\nwith lawyers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nseveral of the dragons behind her retched fire into the\nsky\xe2\x80\xa6apparently in agreement? Or to signal that they were the\nlawyers? Or perhaps they saw some idiot bird fly too close to them?\n\n Hadassah\nintroduced her cousin, Miriam Adleman, and two of her close friends,\nTara Partridge and George Andrews, who are all lawyers brought here\nto discuss the imprisonment and threatened execution of the citizen\nof their world.\n\n Sam\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not welcome here,\xe2\x80\x9d and then, to empathize their\npoint, crafted a papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 horn-of-plenty filled with\nartichokes.\n\n Hours\nlater, after Sam finished the sculpture, Dana said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are\nwelcome here! We welcome all\npeople!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hadassah\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not people!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Dana\ndisagreed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are sentient, you have cares, you have families and\ncareers, and community. You love and you fear others. I respect you\nand you respect me, because we are all people, even if we are not all\nhuman or dragon. Respect does not need to include \xe2\x80\x9cgetting along\nwith\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfully understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d but simply acknowledging that\nthose things are possible. Because of sovereignty and sentience.\nBecause we respect people as people, you are welcome in Night Vale.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n There\nwas a long silence. Then, Sheriff Sam slapped their forehead and\ngroaned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, mayor? This is a blinking disaster!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nGlow Cloud shrunk away, disappointed (or scared\xe2\x80\xa6or possibly bored,\nor something). It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell exactly how clouds feel just by\nlooking at them.\n\n Dana\nand Sam argued over how welcome the dragons were until Hadassah\nroared, \xe2\x80\x9cTHANK YOU MAYOR!\xe2\x80\x9d and Miriam agreed. Her beige head\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis will do nicely. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find ourselves a suitable\nextended-stay Hotel.\n\n Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\nmaroon head said, \xe2\x80\x9cI normally don\xe2\x80\x99t trust humans, but\xe2\x80\xa6she seems\nkind.\n\n Miriams\xe2\x80\x99s\npurple head uttred, \xe2\x80\x9cKindness and trust are not related.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Dana\nand the dragons shook hands/claws, as did Sam (although reluctantly).\n\n Hadassah\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cWe begin negotiations next week!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n So\nit looks like we have some new residents in Night Vale! I really\nappreciate Dana and her openness to people from all backgrounds.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s one of the kindest and most fair people I know. I cannot think\nof a better mayor.\n\n But,\ngiven what happened to Kareem today, I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about the violent\nnature of dragons. Not that they\xe2\x80\x99ll intentionally destroy us,\nnecessarily, but just the physical destruction that comes with beings\na dozen times your size.\n\n Oh,\nKareem just texted me, by the way. I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s listening to the show\nright now from the hospital. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen elephants dance, the\ngrass gets trampled.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hmm.\nKareem sounds confused. There are no elephants in town, and every\nlittle grass, so\xe2\x80\xa6you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to text Kareem back and\nexplain to him what an elephant is. I mean, he may not know.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the sound of distant drums and cannons.\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Drive it like you\nstole it, but you stole it because you really loved it, and you would\nnot like to see it damaged. Basically, drive carefully.'
