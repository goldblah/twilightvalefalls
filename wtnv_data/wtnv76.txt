Episode 65 - Voicemail
b"Cecil, recorded: You have\nreached the voicemail of Cecil Gershwin Palmer. That might seem like\nan easy thing to do, but think about how long you had to stay alive\njust to learn how a phone works and who I am. Congratulate yourself\non that. Give yourself a vigorous pat on the back, and\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\nto leave a message after the heavily distorted sample of a man saying\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat another bite.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\n I\xcc\xb1\xcc\xba\xcc\xad\xcd\x95\xcc\x9c\n\xcc\x90\xcd\x82\xcd\x86\xcc\x8b\xcc\xa5j\xcc\x94\xcc\x92\xcd\xac\xcc\x90\xcd\x86\xcd\x8a\xcd\xae\xcc\xb0\xcc\xa5\xcd\x94u\xcd\x84\xcc\x91\xcd\x85\xcd\x93\xcc\xba\xcc\xb3\xcc\xb0s\xcc\x8f\xcd\x95\xcc\x9d\xcd\x8e\xcc\xbc\xcc\x9et\xcc\x8b\xcd\x9a\n\xcd\x82\xcd\xa7\xcc\x91\xcc\x9f\xcc\xa5c\xcc\x93\xcd\xac\xcc\x81\xcd\x90\xcc\x8c\xcc\x80o\xcd\xa9\xcc\x8b\xcc\x84\xcc\x8a\xcc\xbd\xcd\xac\xcd\x87\xcd\x96u\xcd\xa6\xcc\x8e\xcd\x88\xcc\xb2\xcd\x89\xcd\x8d\xcc\xa9l\xcd\x8a\xcc\xbd\xcc\x89\xcd\x9b\xcc\x85\xcd\xa5\xcc\xa9\xcc\x9cd\xcd\x8c\xcd\x91\xcc\x90\xcd\x97\xcd\x86\xcc\x99\xcc\x9dn\xcc\xac'\xcc\x92\xcd\x97\xcd\x90\xcd\x9b\xcc\x9f\xcc\xb9\xcc\xa6\xcd\x96t\xcd\x8c\xcd\xa8\xcd\x86\xcd\xac\xcc\xb0\xcc\xa0\xcc\x99\xcd\x96\xcc\xb1\xcc\xb9\xcc\xb0\n\xcd\xaa\xcc\x84\xcd\xaf\xcc\x81\xcd\xaf\xcd\x8a\xcc\x8d\xcc\xa4\xcc\xad\xcc\xb2\xcc\xad\xcc\xaa\xcd\x85\xcd\x87e\xcc\x82\xcd\xa9\xcd\x86\xcc\x82\xcd\xa9\xcd\x95\xcd\x88\xcc\xa3a\xcc\xbe\xcc\xaf\xcc\xa0\xcd\x8d\xcc\xaet\xcc\x8a\xcd\x89\xcd\x88\n\xcd\x82\xcd\x90\xcd\x8a\xcc\x8c\xcc\x8c\xcc\x8d\xcd\x85\xcc\x9f\xcc\xafa\xcd\x9b\xcc\xba\xcc\xae\xcc\xbb\xcc\xae\xcc\xb1\xcd\x9a\xcc\xa9n\xcc\x82\xcd\xab\xcc\x8f\xcd\x84\xcc\x9f\xcc\x9d\xcd\x87\xcd\x8e\xcc\xa5o\xcd\x8a\xcc\x8d\xcc\xba\xcc\xb0\xcd\x87\xcd\x94\xcc\xb9\xcd\x93\xcc\xa9t\xcc\x87\xcd\xa6\xcd\x87\xcc\xa0\xcc\xad\xcc\xbbh\xcc\x8a\xcd\x92\xcc\x82\xcd\x9b\xcd\x89\xcc\xb9\xcc\xbc\xcd\x99\xcc\xafe\xcd\x97\xcc\x84\xcd\xa9\xcd\x96\xcc\x97\xcd\x89\xcc\xa6r\xcd\x86\xcd\x84\xcc\x93\xcd\x84\xcc\x96\xcc\xba\xcd\x8d\xcc\xa9\n\xcd\xa4\xcd\xa3\xcd\xa7\xcc\xab\xcd\x88\xcc\x9f\xcc\x97\xcd\x85\xcc\x9eb\xcd\xae\xcd\xa4\xcd\x97\xcd\x8a\xcd\xac\xcd\xa7\xcc\xb0i\xcc\x8d\xcc\xa0\xcc\xba\xcc\x99t\xcc\x86\xcd\x9a\xcd\x99e\xcc\x83\xcd\x90\xcc\x8c\xcc\x9c\xcd\x88\xcc\x9e.\xcd\xa7\xcc\x8d\xcc\x8f\xcd\xaf\xcc\x8b\xcd\x92\xcc\xae\n\n\n Carlos, with wind in the\nbackground: Hey, sweetie, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nCarlos. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re probably busy talking, or not talking. It seems\nlike you\xe2\x80\x99re always talking, or not talking, you know? \n\n So,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll try again in a bit, but I just wanted to let you know what\xe2\x80\x99s up\nhere. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? The sky!\n\n OK,\nOK, that is a funny joke, but it is also a scientifically accurate\none. I only tell scientifically accurate jokes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get how\npeople can find inaccurate jokes funny.\n\n Like,\nOK, so a horse walks into a bar, and says \xe2\x80\x9cI feel used. As a\nspecies, even, I feel used.\xe2\x80\x9d And so then the bartender, who is also\na horse, \xe2\x80\x98cause, you know, this is the Horse District where the\nhorses live when they\xe2\x80\x99re not being used by the humans, and the horse\nbartender says, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I know it, buddy!\xe2\x80\x9d and the first horse\nsays \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not your buddy!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he says, \xe2\x80\x9cMan, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. That was awful of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s the anger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n So,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s another example of a scientifically accurate joke.\n\n Things\nare going really well here. With the help of Doug and Alicia and the\nother members of the masked army who live in this strange desert\nother world, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been starting to build out an infrastructure. Of\ncourse, I had already set up a temporary lab, but now we\xe2\x80\x99ve dug up\nthe stones that were used in the old settlements up on the mountain\nand have been building important basics of life, like shelter and\nroads and blood stone circles. It\xe2\x80\x99s starting to look downright homey\naround here\xe2\x80\xa6if you ignore the disquieting wasteland beyond. So it\xe2\x80\x99s\njust like the rest of the world, really.\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s\nlots of material to work with, because \xe2\x80\x93 get this \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve been\njust finding stuff lately. Microwaves, toolboxes, old tennis balls.\nThey look like they\xe2\x80\x99ve been here a while. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how this stuff\nended up here, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find out.\n\n Ooh!\nThat reminds me. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of getting a tattoo with the definition\nof science straight out of Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary. So it\xe2\x80\x99ll say, quote,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out, OK?\xe2\x80\x9d end quote, and\nthen it\xe2\x80\x99ll have a skull and some roses. Ooh, maybe an anchor, to make\nit look old-timey.\n\n Hmm.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nstill working on how to get you here, but I will. How? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out, OK?\n\n OK?\n\n OK.\n\n I\nlove you. Talk again soon.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Michelle Nguyen:\nHey, Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s Michelle from Dark Owl Records calling. The\nnew\xe2\x80\xa6ugh\xe2\x80\xa6Woody Guthrie album is in for you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re\nstill listening to that stuff! He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been cool since his\nelectro-punk period. We\xe2\x80\x99re all listening to archival recordings of\nbees now.\n\n Come\nin for your stupid album and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the bee sounds while\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re here. And maybe you could hang out for a while, because I\xe2\x80\x99m\nlonely and I need more human contact. Ugh. Woody Guthrie?\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Steve Carlsberg, with \xe2\x80\x9cA\nWandering Star\xe2\x80\x9d from Paint\nYour Wagon playing in the background:\nHey, Cecil! I know you said that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to leave any\nvoicemails on your phone, and you marched around the room waving your\narms and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Steve Carlsberg, no voicemails!\xe2\x80\x9d then you\ntried to convince me that voicemails aren\xe2\x80\x99t real, but you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\nbecause I know what is what around here.\n\n I\nknow what is what.\n\n But\nanyways, I just wanted to make a quick call to see if Janice could\nstay with you in a few months. Abby and I are looking at doing a nice\nlittle vacation. You know, just the two of us. Somewhere romantic,\nlike the Warehouse District, or the Sand Wastes, or Arby\xe2\x80\x99s. You of\nall people know how romantic a long weekend at Arby\xe2\x80\x99s can be!\n\n Which\n\xe2\x80\x93 listen. By the way, I meant it as just a nice gift when I printed\nup all those T-shirts of you and Carlos there, looking up at the\nlights. And you got all weird about it, but\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Sorry I\nmade you upset again.\n\n Just\nget back to me about the Janice thing, or answer me on your radio\nshow while ranting about me. Either way is fine.\n\n Hope\neverything\xe2\x80\x99s going well with Carlos. Hope everything is just\xe2\x80\xa6going.\nHope everything goes. Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. We all do.\n\n Okie\ndokie!\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Tamika Flynn:\nCecil, Tamika Flynn here. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling to let you know that me and the\nrest of the missing children are having a book drive. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking\nbooks and herding them out on the long trail. Sleepless nights on our\nhorses, books clear from our feet out to a horizon gone dusty, with\nthe dreary stomp of spine and page upon Earth, the sad yelp of books\ntaken in the night by coyotes or librarians\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone, but when my horse is neck deep in the Colorado, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99m watching the drowned carcass of some book that will never find a\nreader again float away on that relentless current, I\xe2\x80\x99ll think about\nyou.\n\n Also,\nit will probably be Thursday. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back Thursday. We\xe2\x80\x99re not\ntaking the books that far. They can\xe2\x80\x99t walk, and\xe2\x80\xa6they\xe2\x80\x99re not even\nsentient, so this will be a short one.\n\n Oh!\nGotta go. Night\nFilm by Marisha Pessl is looking restless, and I\xe2\x80\x99m worried it\xe2\x80\x99ll\nstart a stampede!\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Earl Harlan, with the sound of a\ncrowded restaurant in the background:\nHi, it\xe2\x80\x99s me. Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to come back and do another segment of\n\xe2\x80\x9cCooking Stuff with Earl Harlan.\xe2\x80\x9d I have this great recipe for\npumpkin pie. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much less blood splatter than you would\nthink!\n\n Um,\nbut listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to schedule a little more time in my life for\nmy son. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for both of us, what with me having a full-time\nkitchen job, plus going straight from being a childless teenager to a\nmiddle-aged man with an eleven-year-old. I\xe2\x80\x93 I mean, they have\nSesame Street episodes about it that you can show your kid, but even\nwith PBS\xe2\x80\x99s help, trying to explain how weird time is? It\xe2\x80\x99s really\nhard! Time is unimaginably weird.\n\n Uh,\nmy son\xe2\x80\x99s name is Roger. I finally asked him, and he told me. It was\nthat easy, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy at all.\n\n I\ngotta get back to the kitchen. We have a lot of orders coming in,\nplus it\xe2\x80\x99s on fire. Cook with you soon, Cecil.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Fey:\nSEVENTEEN. EIGHTY-EIGHT. [DING] FORTY-NINE. EIGHTY-SIX. EIGHTY-ONE. SIXTY-EIGHT.\n\n \xe2\x99\xab 'CAUSE I AM A CHAMPION \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa\nAND YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE GONNA HEAR ME\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x99\xaa [SIGH]\n\n EIGHTY-ONE. EIGHTY-THREE. [DING] FOUR.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Carlos:\nHey, sorry to call again so soon\xe2\x80\xa6I know we talked about space and\nboundaries and all of that, especially with this whole Lot 37 thing\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going through\xe2\x80\xa6gotta have time to think. And Cec, I\nunderstand a time to think, but I have made an important scientific\ndiscovery, and you know\nthe rules are different when an important scientific discovery is\nmade. An important scientific discovery is grounds to interrupt\nanything!\n\n I\nfound people! Here, in this desert other world! We \xe2\x80\x93 me, and the\nmembers of the masked army \xe2\x80\x93 saw human shapes coming towards us.\nThe masked army opted, as is their way, for something of a warlike\nresponse, but I convinced them that it was important to discover the\nfacts before formulating a response \xe2\x80\x93 an idea to which Doug roared\nin a fearsome voice, \xe2\x80\x9cTHAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE! LET\xe2\x80\x99S GO\nCHAT WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT\xe2\x80\x99S UP!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And here is, my\nsweet Cecil, what was up. These people were citizens of Night Vale.\nThey had been lost from their home, as of today, for exactly two\nyears, and they have apparently been wandering the desert since!\n\n They are a tad\ntraumatized by their years in a featureless wasteland accompanied\nonly by a distant rumble and a bright light that they felt primarily\nin the roots of their teeth, and so they haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me yet how they\ngot here, but I have them resting in the hot yoga studio we recently\nbuilt, so I hope to hear their story soon. And when I hear the story,\nyou will too. And then, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everyone who listens to\nyour show will, you old blabbermouth! \n\n\n You know, it\nwould upset me if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t just who you are. So much of each other\nwould be annoying if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t also the essence of us. Hmm.\n\n OK, more soon.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Deb:\nHello, Cecil. It\xe2\x80\x99s Deb, the sentient patch of haze. I have some new\nad copy I wanted to run by you, and then I want to disregard any\npetty human feelings you have about it, and then I want to run the ad\non the air. Here goes, okay?\n\n\nI drift above\nyou. I see mostly the top of your heads. You are pitiful from that\nperspective. Your hair droops, or falls out, or hangs flat. I haze\nabove you, sentiently. You slog below me, humanly.\n\n\n\nSentient patches\nof haze: we are the future. We are also the past. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t even the\nprops. You are the backdrop.\n\n\n So if you have\nany issues or questions at all about that ad, don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to not\ntell me.\n\n Hope you\xe2\x80\x99re\nhaving a great day. Okay, Cecil, buh-bye.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Faceless Old Woman, with the sound\nof moths fluttering about in the background:\nHello, Cecil. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your\nHome. I\xe2\x80\x99m in your closet, listening to moths eat one of your suits.\nThey make such a lovely crunch and tear.\n\n I\njust wanted to reach out in regards to you protecting your former\nintern, Dana, against Hiram and I\xe2\x80\x99s good work toward destroying her.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve foiled us more than once. I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget that, Cecil. I forget\nnothing. Unlike you, your brain a dusty surface so easily blown\nclean.\n\n My\nmemory cakes on. It stains. It warps. My memory\xe2\x80\x99s erosion. It is on\nthe very surface of the earth.\n\n Do\nyou feel my fingernails on your back? No. You don\xe2\x80\x99t. I could do so\nmany things to you without you feeling it. Remember that, if you\nremember nothing else\xe2\x80\xa6which seems likely these days.\n\n Tell\nCarlos I said hi. I always liked him.\n\n And\nstay out of my way, or I will destroy you. Just as these moths I\ncaught outside and carried into your closet are destroying all of\nyour clothing.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Old Woman Josie:\nCecil. I\xe2\x80\x99m here with Erika and Erika, just checking to see if we can\nget a ride to league night later. My car\xe2\x80\x99s in the shop because I\nstopped believing in it, so if you can fit us all in there, we\xe2\x80\x99d\nappreciate it.\n\n Also,\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t use my left hand lately, so it might be a little tricky, but\nwe are still going to win. We\xe2\x80\x99ll crush 'em, Cecil!\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Dana:\nHi, Cecil! It\xe2\x80\x99s may\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s Dana. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re doing OK. You seem\nkind of\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, lately. Lately you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nit weird how we talked more when I was trapped in that distant desert\nother world than now when we work a five-minute drive from each\nother? It\xe2\x80\x99s funny how life works.\n\n That\nword meant the opposite of its usual meaning. That\xe2\x80\x99s funny too, I\nguess.\n\n I\nknow you think I bought Lot 37, but you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in Night\nVale at the time. Yes, I projected myself into the auction that day,\nbut I only bought some collectible spoons and a Lee Marvin\nautographed baseball of my brother. That\xe2\x80\x99s all, though.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nawful when you can see the reasoning for someone\xe2\x80\x99s feeling towards\nyou while knowing wholly that they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\n\n I\nwonder sometimes if my double could have done better, or if I am the\ndouble, whether the original me would have done better. Did I destroy\nmy better half? Then maybe I was lucky that even half of me was\nbetter, once upon a time.\n\n Cecil,\nI do my best with what I have. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much.\n\n I\nhope we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk soon. Night Vale needs me as much as it needs you,\nand when it comes down to it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand for that before anything\nelse. It\xe2\x80\x99s my job.\n\n OK.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n [Electronic\nstatic and feedback]\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Carlos:\nHey, OK, quick update, and then *poof* I\xe2\x80\x99m gone again from your\nvoicemail.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nput some of the junk we found and some of the people\nwe found in my lab, and I\xe2\x80\x99m studying them using microscopes and vials\nof bubbling liquid and me making thoughtful expressions and saying\nthings like \xe2\x80\x9cHmm.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\xe2\x80\x99m really using all of the available\nscientific tools right now.\n\n Ooh,\nI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m on the verge of something big here, something new!\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncall you soon. [Gasp] This is so exciting!\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Hiram McDaniels - Gold Head:\nWell, howdy Cecil! Uh, Frank Chen here.\n\n Blue Head:\nYes, Frank Chen. With 100% certainty, that is who I am.\n\n Gold Head:\nRight. Uh, so, uh, Frank Chen, normal human with one voice. No other\nvoices interrupting that main voice, making me sound anything less\nthan human.\n\n Green Head:\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Someone put the phone near my ears! I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear!\n\n Gray Head: Well,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s that busted.\n\n Gold Head:\nJust normal Frank Chen, uh, playing a joke with funny voices, wantin\xe2\x80\x99\nto hear if the mayor told you any plans she might have. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious\n'cause, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m a citizen, and a voter.\n\n Purple Head:\nThis was a bad plan! I told you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any more to do with\nyour foolish plans!\n\n Gold Head:\nPurple! Green, Blue, Gray, come on, guys! We\xe2\x80\x99re in this together!\n\n [Exasperated\nsigh]\n\n Just\xe2\x80\xa6all\nright. Frank Chen, average person of normal head amount, saying, uh,\ngoodbye. See ya around, Cecil.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Automated voices:\nHello, this is your daily\nupdate from the automated weather\nservice. Here is the current weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cTag!\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Scarves]\n\n Automated\nvoices:\nThank you for using our automated weather\nservice. Have a nice\nday.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Carlos:\nCecil! Cecil, I did it! I understand! I hooked everything up to\ncomputers, and I said \xe2\x80\x9chmm\xe2\x80\x9d a lot, and then I asked the people to\ntalk about how they ended up in the desert and it turned out that\nthey were all lured into the Dog Park during Poetry Week. And then\nthe gates closed on them, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this desert ever since.\n\n And\nI thought about this. I thought about how Dana came in here with them\non that same day, and about all of the stuff I found, which I think\nis junk that people got rid of by throwing them over the walls of the\nforbidden Dog Park.\n\n And\nI realized\xe2\x80\xa6this is\nthe Dog Park! This whole desert, the mountain, the light up on the\nmountain, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a vast, perhaps endless, and definitely\nendlessly forbidden Dog Park!\n\n Which\nmeans you can visit now! You just have to walk through that Dog Park\ngate, and then\xe2\x80\xa6you know, walk a few more hundred miles after that\nto wherever we\xe2\x80\x99re at in this huge desert, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to\ntake that vacation here!\n\n Uh,\ncall me as soon as you get this. Cecil! Oh, honey-voiced honey!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to visit!\n\n Talk\nsoon. I love you.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Kevin:\nHey, friend! We haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken in a while. Not since all\nthat\xe2\x80\xa6unpleasantness happened. I hope everything has been\nsuper-pleasant since then.\n\n Oh!\nBut hey! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on something I\xe2\x80\x99d like to show you. I think\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be just jazzed about it! Get back to me A.S.A.P., OK?\n\n Until\nnext time, Cecil. Until next time.\n\n [BEEP]\n\n Instead\nof a proverb today, I just have some important news about the stray\ncats that live outside my apartment. There is the usual one, named\nBisquick, who is missing one ear and is terrifying, but today I saw a\nsecond one, who is fatter and less terrifying and who I have named\nThe Baron. I will keep you updated as events unfold."
