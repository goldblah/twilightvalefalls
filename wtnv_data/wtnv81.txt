Episode 70A - Taking Off
b'Kevin:\nWe all have to start somewhere. We all have to end somewhere, too,\nbut let\xe2\x80\x99s concentrate on the other thing.\n\n Welcome\nto\xe2\x80\xa6well, hmm. Welcome to the Desert Otherworld.\n\n We\nshould come up with a better name for this place. Names are, after\nall, extremely important.\n\n Hi,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m your radio host Kevin. I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking to you from our brand new\nstation! And this is our inaugural broadcast. I\xe2\x80\x99m so\nexcited to be back on the air!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we have any listeners yet, but we will. We will!\n\n Later\nin the show, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to Doug and Alisha, leaders of the army\nof masked giants who roam this desert, and who have been instrumental\nin building our new city. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been so welcoming to us outsiders!\nNot all outsiders,\nthough. They are, after all, a violent and territorial army. But some\noutsiders. People like me and like my friend Carlos. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\nscientist. He\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful man who does beautiful things.\n\n I have\nCarlos on the phone with us right now with some breaking news.\nCarlos! Tell everyone about the huge project you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on\nthis past year.\n\n Carlos:\nHi, Kevin! Thanks for having me on the show.\n\n So,\nfirst off, Doug and Alisha are here in my kitchen. Alisha built a\nrefrigerator from some cactus pads, twine, and three different kinds\nof birds, and now\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re making a bunch of pasta salad for lunch this week! They\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsave some for you if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\n Kevin:\nHow delightful! I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6totally disgusted by pasta salad. Can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\nthe taste or the smell. In fact, to look at it causes me to heave.\nBut thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s so kind!\n\n Carlos:\n\xe2\x80\xa6Right.\n\n So,\nthis new experiment \xe2\x80\x93 and I have to tell you, I am really\nexcited about it. You know how our cell phones always work in this\ndesert otherworld, even though there are no towers, and how they\nnever seem to run out of battery?\n\n Kevin:\nYes! I love taking\nthese facts for granted!\n\n Carlos:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the verge of uncovering what\xe2\x80\x99s causing that. Here in my\nlaboratory, which Doug and Alisha and one of the other soldiers whose\nname is [ten seconds of guttural throat noise]\nbuilt for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard at work pacing about in front of a row\nof conical flasks, beakers, and Y-tubes, furiously\nwriting Greek letters and Arabic numbers and I think,\nlater today, I will make an enormous breakthrough.\n\n Kevin:\nWhat did you find out?\n\n Carlos:\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t say yet. I\xe2\x80\x99m just waiting on my computer to finish\ncalculating the\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Kevin:\n\xe2\x80\xa6Everything okay?\n\n Carlos:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Alisha and Doug look really agitated. They\xe2\x80\x99re jumping\nup and down by the window. The other giant soldiers are running into\nformation outside. I need to see what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\n\n Kevin:\nWhile Carlos checks on our favorite soldiers, let\xe2\x80\x99s get an update now\non the roller coaster inhabitants!\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nreferring to the roller coaster Doug and Alisha built for our new\ntown months ago. It looks terribly fun! It has a tall first hill, and\na 90\xc2\xba drop off that is almost 600 feet, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, and then, it goes\ninto a series of loops and turns and figure 8s and then\nsome spirals, where the riders go upside down several times! Per\nsecond! And then, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sheet of flames that, as you approach, it\nlooks like you\xe2\x80\x99re about to go right through the fire, but at the last\nsecond, the track spirals again and you go through the fire upside\ndown!\n\n Ohh!\nAnyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting-looking ride. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been on it yet.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because after they started it on its first trip, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen able to stop it. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent brakes, so\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s an\nissue!\n\n And\neven though they cut the power to the ride, it\xe2\x80\x99s still going, with\nthe same passengers, caught in an interminable cycle of fun!\n\n Ohh!\nWe have Carlos back on the line again! Carlos?\n\n Carlos:\nDoug and Alisha are gone. It turns out that the commotion was over\nanother army marching along the horizon. Doug and Alisha ran\nscreaming around the\nhouse and through the kitchen, overturning my cutting board and\ngrabbing their weapons. Alisha took my chef\xe2\x80\x99s knife, and Doug made a\nmakeshift slughorn out of one of my large funnels so that he could\ncall their army to action.\n\n Kevin:\nGood for them, protecting our community!\n\n Carlos:\nNo, but\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I was trying to explain that the other army was\nmarching perpendicular\nto us, they were not marching towards\nus. This desert is filled with small armies, always marching in\ndifferent directions. We\xe2\x80\x93 we can\xe2\x80\x99t attack them all for no reason!\n\n And\nnow my kitchen counter is demolished.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, it\xe2\x80\x99ll grow back.\n\n So?\nI\xe2\x80\x99m so excited to learn more about your research into the strange\nproperties of this region. I think you once called this desert\notherworld \xe2\x80\x9cthe most scientifically interesting community in the\nU.S.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Carlos:\nWell\xe2\x80\xa6no, my exact words were\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Kevin:\nSo\xe2\x80\xa6when do you expect the results? Sounds like whatever you come up\nwith could possibly be a monumental shift in how we perceive\nthermodynamic laws.\n\n Carlos:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m at my lab right now, hunched over my computer, waiting for\nit to complete its final report, then comparing its results to my\nthousands of hand-written notes from the past year. I believe I can\npinpoint the exact source of this desert\xe2\x80\x99s energy. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\nlong. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t rush me.\n\n Kevin:\nGreat! Let us know soon, though!\n\n While\nCarlos does that, perhaps I can tell you all a little bit about our\nnew radio station. Take you on an audio tour, if you will.\n\n We\nhave a tall broadcast tower made of stones and adobe. Those zig-zaggy\nelectrical bolts visibly shooting outward from the top of the tower?\nThose are actual radio waves!\n\n Inside\nthe building itself, we have a small broadcast booth with a couple of\nnew mics. Some of the members of the masked army of giants helped me\ndecorate my studio, too! It was so empty and bloodless before. It\nrequired a lot of lizards and rodents, but\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s finally starting to\nfeel like home!\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot a producer\xe2\x80\x99s booth just off to my right. I can see my old intern\nVanessa in there, hi Vanessa!! We\xe2\x80\x99re a bit understaffed, so Vanessa\nhas been having to act as my producer as well as head of sales and\nmarketing, and even answering phones! Good thing she has a\ndoppelg\xc3\xa4nger to help out. Most people kill their double,\nbut\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s such a waste of a good opportunity! The more the\nmerrier, the more productive, I say!\n\n Oh!\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re hiring right now! If you have experience in any of the\nfollowing areas: ad sales, graphic design, office management,\nentomology, Fortran programming, falconry, or sports law, please send\nyour resume to Radio Station, Care of Kevin.\n\n We\nhave no postal service in the desert otherworld, nor any mailboxes,\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s important that you carefully re-read The\nSecret by Rhonda Byrne in order to wish\nyour resume into my office.\n\n Sounds\nlike Carlos is back on the line now! Did you get the results from\nyour\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Carlos:\nDoug and Alisha are back.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, good! So wonderful to have dear friends around to be a part of\nyour brilliant achievement.\n\n Carlos:\nYeah, but they\xe2\x80\x99re in no condition to celebrate the great strides of\nscientific study right now. Most of the army returned from fighting,\nbut there are more than a dozen who did not. Alisha lost two fingers,\nand Doug is bleeding quite badly because of a compound fracture in\nhis forearm. Everyone who returned is in treatable condition. I\nbelieve they\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. But they\xe2\x80\x99re wounded, and need lots of rest.\n\n [Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 voice turns away from the\nphone] And no more fighting for a long time!\n\n [Carlos again speaks directly into\nthe phone] It\xe2\x80\x99s a mess over\nhere.\n\n Kevin:\nGood thing they have such a good and helpful friend in you.\n\n So,\ntell us about your study on the strange energy here in the desert.\n\n Carlos:\nUgh. I\xe2\x80\x93 I c\xe2\x80\x93 I can\xe2\x80\x99t yet. The army came in so quickly, dropping\ntheir weapons everywhere, along with some detached limbs that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\neven think belong to\nthem, and all of my journals, which I had left out and open on my\ndesk, have been rendered unusable. There are broken beakers and\nblood-soaked composition notebooks everywhere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\nwhere to begin cleaning up all of this blood!\n\n Kevin, faintly: Ohhh.\nOhhh!\n\n Carlos:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did you just say something?\n\n Kevin:\nNnnnnnnnnno? I\xe2\x80\xa6just\xe2\x80\xa6like your story. Carry on.\n\n Carlos:\n[Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 voice turns away from the phone] Doug?\nDoug? Come back!\n\n [Carlos again speaks directly into\nthe phone] Kevin, I have to go.\nDoug just constructed a makeshift splint out of rocks and snakes. He\njust grabbed his axe and ran out the back door.\n\n Ugh.\nAnd there goes Alisha.\n\n [Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 voice turns away from the\nphone] Stop going to war! You need rest!\n\n [Carlos again speaks directly into\nthe phone] Call you back, Kevin.\nThey can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like this.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word of strong winds out of the east,\nstirring up dust devils and hurling plant debris and weak-willed\nanimals through the air. This is a rare sunless day for our\notherworld desert.\n\n While\nCarlos tries to get his notes un-bloodied, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a closer look\nat the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPyramid\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Jason\nWebley]\n\n Kevin:\nWow! That weather report was informative! I had no idea how dangerous\na storm that was until I heard that report.\n\n To be\na radio broadcaster who gets to tell stories about things that make\nus unhappy thrills me to my bones! Because by telling people about\nall that can make us unhappy, I prepare them to truly enjoy those\nhappy moments when they come.\n\n Once,\nmy hometown of Desert Bluffs had a deadly outbreak of throat spiders.\nHundreds were diagnosed with this usually-treatable disease, but it\nwas a particularly virulent strain, and many people died, or were\nleft without voices and lower jaws when it was all over. Almost a day\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go by where you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a fit of strenuous coughing,\npunctuated by a muffled *pop*\nonly to turn around and see a cascade of tiny spiders pouring over\nthe craggy ledge that used to be a person\xe2\x80\x99s lower teeth.\n\n Each\nday I got to report these upsetting stories, but the best\npart about it was when Desert Bluffs residents eventually stopped\nlosing part of their faces to throat spiders, and we all rejoiced in\nour newly-healthy and happy lives.\n\n As the\nsaying goes, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s always dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Oh!\nAnd speaking of sunshine, Carlos just arrived here, live in the\nstudio with me! Carlos? Did you go out in this weather? You\xe2\x80\x99re\ncovered in dust, and those look like friction burns in the shape of\nlab goggles on your face. Are you okay? Did Doug and Alisha make it\nback?\n\n Carlos:\nNot yet. They\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n What\nis this all over your studio? Is that barbecue sauce?\n\n Kevin:\nOh, that? That\xe2\x80\x99s just blood! And some old bones, and loose teeth, and\nbeaks and things. I finally decorated, thanks for noticing! And I\njust notice you have a piece of paper in your hand! That must be your\nfinal report! Look at how we both notice things about each other! I\nlove that!\n\n Carlos:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6I, um\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Kevin:\nWell, you sound sad. Which is great news, because it means you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nhappy again eventually! It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough day, what with all the weather\nand the wars and the blood. But you\xe2\x80\x99re boyfriend will soon be moving\nfrom Night Vale to come live here with you!\n\n Carlos:\nWell, um\xe2\x80\xa6about that\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Kevin:\nAnd? And? You finally\nhave the scientific results of your hard scientific work!\n\n Carlos:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have results, Kevin! When the army marched out again\nI went back to trying to recover my notes. I had just gotten the lab\ndesktops clean when Alisha\xe2\x80\x99s large dog bounded through the lab and\nout the front door, sending every glass tube and jar crashing onto\nthe floor. When I bent over to see the damage, I saw my computer\nthere too, just on the tiles, snapped nearly in half, a tuft of white\nfur covering the keyboard, singed slightly by the smoke streaking out\nof the broken monitor.\n\n I lost\nit all, Kevin. My entire year of study is gone.\n\n Kevin:\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the paper, then? Did you at least learn some\nof your results?\n\n Carlos:\nThis is nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s, um, just a letter I wrote to, uh\xe2\x80\xa6a friend.\n\n Kevin:\nOh? I love letters!\nLetters are so fun to receive!\n\n Carlos:\nMmm, not this one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad letter. A letter about regrets, about\nmistakes.\n\n You\nknow how sometimes you spend a lot of time with someone, and you\nthink that the someone makes you happy, but then suddenly one day you\nrealize\xe2\x80\xa6maybe you weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy at all. Maybe both would be better\noff doing what you love in different places. Without each other.\nMaybe neither of you were as happy as either of you thought.\n\n Kevin:\nThat is a sad-sounding letter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand or like that at\nall.\n\n Carlos:\nI have spent the last year all wrong.\n\n Kevin:\nI believe in you, Carlos! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let destruction, blood, and war hold\nyou back! You\xe2\x80\x99re a brilliant scientist!\n\n Carlos:\nI realize I need to just start everything over, rededicate myself. I\nneed to do it right this time. No more distractions. I can\xe2\x80\x99t spend\nanother year like this one.\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6it\npains me to carry this letter, but\xe2\x80\xa6I wrote it to set my boundaries.\n\n Kevin:\nSo you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s no postal service here yet.\n\n Carlos:\nI know. Um, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m hand-delivering it.\n\n Kevin:\nOh. Remember, no one should ever be sad. Choose not to be sad,\nCarlos. In fact, choose to be happy! Perhaps your letter is the first\nstep to choosing happiness, even while it makes someone else sad.\n\n Carlos:\nI understand. Listen, um, I should go. I\xe2\x80\x99m headed to Night Vale one\nfinal time. I need to talk to Cecil about\xe2\x80\xa6well, about some changes.\nThanks for everything, Kevin. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been so kind to me in this\ndifficult year.\n\n Kevin:\nGoodbye, Carlos!\n\n Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that our huge scientific breakthrough didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\nhappen today. As the old phrase goes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best-laid plans of mice\nand men are completely different kinds of plans altogether. Very\ndifferent creatures, those two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n But\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not a total wash. Our next show should feature spine-tingling\nadventure stories about today\xe2\x80\x99s desert battles! We have so\nmuch to do, us. So much to\nexplore and understand. So much to make here in our great desert\notherworld.\n\n Say,\nwe really do need a name for this place. Things without names don\xe2\x80\x99t\nreally exist. So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call this\xe2\x80\xa6well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call it\nDesert Bluffs! Desert Bluffs was the name of my hometown, and by\nnaming it Desert Bluffs, this place becomes my new\nhometown! We are in my home!! We are in Desert Bluffs, no matter\nwhere we are in space or time. What is a town but a name, right?\n\n Until\nnext time, New Desert \xe2\x80\x93 Oh. It looks like Carlos left behind that\nletter he was supposed to hand deliver. I\xe2\x80\x99d better not read it.\n\n Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno.\nBetter not.\n\n Until\nnext time, New Desert Bluffs. Until next time.\n\n [Sound\nof Kevin opening the letter]\n\n Oh. Oh\nno! This is so sad!\n\n No. I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like this. I am sad.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: A rose by any other\nname is called something else.'
