Bonus Episode 5 - Excerpt From the Novel
b'The history of the town of Night Vale is long and complicated,\nreaching back thousands of years to the earliest indigenous people in\nthe desert. We will cover none of it here. Suffice it to say that it\nis a town like many towns \xe2\x80\x93 with a City Hall, and a bowling alley\n(the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex), and a diner\n(the Moonlite All-Nite Diner), and a supermarket (Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s). And, of\ncourse, a community radio station, reporting all the news that we are\nallowed to hear.\n\n \nOn all sides, it is surrounded by empty desert flatness. It is much\nlike your town, perhaps. It might be more like your town than you\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to admit.\n\n \nIt is a friendly desert community, where the sun is hot, the moon is\nbeautiful, and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend\nto sleep.\n\n \nWelcome to Night Vale.\n\n \n ONE \n\n\n \nPawn shops in Night Vale work like this: first, you need an item to\npawn. To get this, you need a lot of time behind you. Years spent\nliving and existing, until you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached a point where you believe\nthat you exist, and that a physical item exists, and that the concept\nof ownership exists. And that, improbable as all those are, these\nabsurd beliefs line up in a way that result in you owning an item.\n\n \nGood job! Nicely done!\n\n \nSecond, once you believe you own an item, you must reach a point\nwhere you need money more than you need the item. This is the easiest\nstep \xe2\x80\x93 just own an item, and own a body with needs, and wait.\n\n \nThe only pawn shop in the town of Night Vale is run by the very young\nJackie Fierro. It has no name, but if you need it, you will know\nwhere it is. This knowledge will come suddenly, often while you are\nin the shower. You will collapse, surrounded by a bright glowing\nblackness, and you will find yourself on your hands and knees, the\nwarm water running over you, and you will know where the pawn shop\nis. You will smell must, and soap, and feel a stab of panic about how\nalone you are.\n\n \nIt will be like most showers you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\n\n \nBefore you can offer Jackie your item, there will first be some hand\nwashing, which is why there are bowls of purified water throughout\nthe shop. You need to chant a little as you wash your hands. You, of\ncourse, should always chant when you wash your hands. It is\nonly hygienic.\n\n \nWhen you have been properly purified, you will lay the item on the\ncounter, and Jackie will consider it. Jackie will have her feet up on\nthe counter. She will lean back.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d she will say. She will always say \xe2\x80\x9cEleven\ndollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nYou will not respond. You are, ultimately, unnecessary to this\nprocess. You are, ultimately, unnecessary.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she will say, waving her hand. And then she will name\nher actual price. Usually it is money. Sometimes it is other things.\nSometimes it is dreams, experiences, visions.\n\n \nThen you will die \xe2\x80\x93 but only for a little while.\n\n \nThe item will be given a price tag, $11. Everything in the pawn shop\nis that price, no matter what she loaned you for it.\n\n \nOnce you are no longer dead, she will give you a ticket, which later\nyou will be able to exchange for the item. Or, at any time, you may\nlook at the ticket and remember the item. Remembering the item is\nfree.\n\n \nYou are leaving this story now. You were only an\nexample. And it is probably safer for you not to be in this\nstory anyway.\n\n \nJackie Fierro squinted out the window at the parking lot. There was\nno one coming. She was closing soon. Relatively speaking, she was\nalways closing soon, and also always just opening.\n\n \nBeyond the window was the parking lot, and beyond that the desert,\nand beyond that the sky (mostly void, partially stars). Layered from\nher vantage, it was all distance, equally unreachable from her post\nat the counter.\n\n \nShe had recently turned 19. She had been recently-19 for as long as\nshe could remember. The pawn shop had been hers for a long time.\nCenturies, maybe. Clocks and calendars don\xe2\x80\x99t work in Night Vale. Time\nitself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\n\n \nFor all her years as the newly-19 owner of the pawn shop, she left\nthe shop only when it was closed, and then only to her apartment,\nwhere she sat with her feet up on the coffee table, taking in the\ncommunity radio and the local cable news. Based on what the news told\nher, the outside world seemed a dangerous place. There was always\nsome world-ending cataclysm threatening Night Vale. Feral dogs, a\nsentient glowing cloud with the ability to control minds (although\nthe Glow Cloud had become less threatening since its election to the\nlocal school board), old oak doors that led to a strange desert\notherworld, where the current mayor had been trapped for months\xe2\x80\xa6it\nseemed safer to not have friends or hobbies. Just sit at work, head\ndown, doing her job, and then sit at home, glass after glass of\norange juice, radio on, safe from anything that might disrupt her\nroutine.\n\n \nHer days were spent in silence. Mostly void, partially thought. Some\ndays she would re-catalog her inventory. Other days she would clean\nthe shelves. Every day she would sit and think. She would try to\nthink about the day she took over the store. There must have\nbeen a day like that, but she could not think of the specifics. She\nhad been doing this for decades. She was very young. Both of these\nwere true at the same time.\n\n \nShe knew college was a thing 19 year olds did. She knew being\nunemployed in a difficult job market and living at home was a thing\nother 19 year olds did. She was content doing neither of those, so\nshe continued on and on and on at the pawn shop.\n\n \nShe understood the world and her place in it. She understood nothing.\nThe world and her place in it were nothing, and she understood\nthat.\n\n \nBecause of the lack of working time in Night Vale, she went off her\ngut feeling about when the shop should close. When the feeling came,\nit came, and the doors had to be locked, removed from their frames,\nand safely hidden. The feeling came. She swung her feet off the\ncounter. A decent day.\n\n \nOld Woman Josie, who lived out by the Car Lot, had come in with a\ngreat number of cheap plastic flamingos. She had carried them in a\nlarge canvas sack, and emptied them onto the counter like loose\nchange.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for myself that I give up these little ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Old\nWoman Josie, addressing a bare wall several feet to the right of\nJackie in a strong, formal voice, making the occasional sweeping\ngesture with her palm, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nJosie stopped, her palm still out.\n\n \nJackie decided the speech was over. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, man. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\nyou\xe2\x80\xa6eleven dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \nOld Woman Josie tightened her eyes at the bare wall.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cOookaayyy\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie softened, prodding at one of the flamingos\nand looking at its weak plastic belly. \xe2\x80\x9cTell you what. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\nyou a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nOld Woman Josie shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nA good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep was a wildly generous offer. The flamingos were\nworthless, but there were so many of them, and Jackie couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhelp herself. She never refused an item.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful not to touch those directly,\xe2\x80\x9d Josie said, after she\nwas finished being dead.\n\n \nUsing shop rags, Jackie laid the flamingos out, side by side, on a\nshelf, each one tagged with a single handwritten $11 price tag.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cMost things shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be touched anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie thought.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Josie, taking the ticket that Jackie had\nfilled out. \xe2\x80\x9cCome by sometime and talk to the angels. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been\nasking about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nThe angels lived with Old Woman Josie in her small tract home, whose\ntract no longer stood, leaving it alone at the edge of town. The\nangels did chores for her, and Josie made a modest income selling\nitems they had touched. No one understood why the angels lived with\nher. Very little was understood about the angels; some things were.\n\n \nOf course, angels do not exist. It is illegal to consider\ntheir existence, or even to give them a dollar when they forget bus\nmoney and start hovering around the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s asking for change.\n\n \nThe great hierarchy of angels is a foolish dream, and anyway is\nforbidden knowledge to Night Vale citizens. All of the angels in\nNight Vale lived with Josie out by the car lot. There are no angels\nin Night Vale.\n\n \nAround the middle of the day, Jackie had acquired a car. It was a\nMercedes, only a few years old, and offered with urgency by a young\nman wearing a gray pinstriped business suit stained with dirt. It was\nimpressive how he got the car onto the counter, but there is a way\nthese things are done, and it had to go on the counter.\n\n \nHe washed his hands, and chanted. The water went brown and red.\n\n \nShe settled on an offer of five dollars, talking him down from\neleven, and he laughed as he took the money and the ticket.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cHaha it\xe2\x80\x99s not funny at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, laughing.\n\n \nAnd, finally, a woman named Diane Crayton arrived late in the\nafternoon \xe2\x80\x93 almost closing time, according to Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s gut.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie asked. She was unsure why she asked\nthis, as Jackie rarely greeted people who came in the store.\n\n \nJackie knew who Diane was. She organized PTA fundraisers. Diane\nsometimes came by to distribute fliers that said things like \xe2\x80\x9cNight\nVale High School PTA Fund Drive! Help give kids the\nmunicipally-approved education they deserve! Your support is\nmandatory, and appreciated!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nDiane, in Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s mind, looked just like a woman who would be an\nactive PTA mom, with her kind face and comfortable clothing. She also\nthought Diane looked like a woman who would be a loan officer, with\nher conservative makeup choices and serious demeanor. She would\nlook like a pharmacist, if she were to ever wear the standard white\ncoat, gas mask, and hip waders.\n\n \nShe looked like a lot of things to Jackie. Mostly, she looked like a\nperson lost in both a place and a moment.\n\n \nDiane took a handkerchief from her purse. Without changing her upward\ndistant expression, she wept a single tear onto the cloth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to offer this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, finally looking at Jackie.\n\n \nJackie considered the handkerchief. The tear would dry soon. \xe2\x80\x9cEleven\ndollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s the deal,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take it,\xe2\x80\x9d Diane said. Her loose-hanging arms were now drawn\nup near her purse.\n\n \nJackie took the tear-dabbed handkerchief and gave Diane her ticket\nand the money. After her brief death, Diane thanked her and hurried\nout of the shop.\n\n \nJackie tagged the tear with it\xe2\x80\x99s $11 price tag and placed it on a\nshelf.\n\n \nSo, a decent day.\n\n \nJackie flipped the sign on the door to CLOSED, her hand touching the\nwindow, leaving its ghost upon the glass. A hand raised to say\n\xe2\x80\x9cstop,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccome here,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chello!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chelp!\xe2\x80\x9d or,\nmaybe, only \xe2\x80\x9cI am here. This hand, at least, is real.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nShe looked down to adjust the items on the counter, and when she\nlooked up, the man was there. He was wearing a tan jacket, and\nholding a deerskin suitcase. He had normal human features. He had\narms and legs. He might have had hair, or maybe was wearing a hat?\nEverything was normal.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Everett.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nJackie screamed.\n\n \nThe man was perfectly normal.\n\n \nShe screamed.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you closed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. No. Can I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n \nThere was buzzing coming from somewhere. His mouth?\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an item I would very much like to pawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and waved her hand to indicate everything she\nmight have said next.\n\n \nHe nodded at her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your help. Have I introduced\nmyself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cAh. I apologize. My name is Emmett.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nThey shook hands. Her hand continued to shake after he let go.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chere is the item.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nHe set a small slip of paper on the counter. On it, written in dull\nsmeared pencil, were the words:\n\n\n \nKing City\n\n\n \nThe handwriting was shaky, and the pencil had been pressed down hard.\n\n \nShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop staring at it, although she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what about\nit was interesting.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cInteresting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not very,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Man in the Tan Jacket. The man washed\nhis hands and quietly chanted, and Jackie forced herself to lean back\nand put her feet on the counter. There is a way these things are\ndone.\n\n \nShe looked a few times at the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, but she found she forgot it\nthe moment she stopped looking.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cEleven dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \nThe man hummed, and other small voices joined him \xe2\x80\x93 apparently from\nwithin the deerskin suitcase.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did this come from?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you offering it\nto me? What would I do with it\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice was high and cracked. It\ndid not sound like her at all.\n\n \nThe man was now harmonizing with the voices from his suitcase. He did\nnot seem to register her questions.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, fully aware of but unable to stop\nher poor negotiating technique. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistake. Thirty dollars, and an\nidea about time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cDone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\n\n \nWas that a smile?\n\n \nShe gave him the $30 and told him her idea about time.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought of it\nthat way. Generally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nThen he died.\n\n \nShe usually used this time to finish up the paperwork, get the ticket\nready. She did nothing. She clutched the slip of paper in her hand.\n\n \nHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dead anymore.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, your ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still possibly smiling. She\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a good enough look at his face to tell.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your ticket! There is a way these things are done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nShe scrawled out a ticket with the information tickets always had: a\nrandom number (12,739), the quality of light at the time of\ntransaction (fine), the general feeling of the weather outside\n(looming), her current thoughts on the future (looming, but fine),\nand a quick sketch of what she thought hearts should look\nlike, instead of the pulsing lumps of straw and clay that grow,\ncancer-like, into our chests when we turn nine years old.\n\n \nHe took the ticket as she thrust it at him, and then, thanking her,\nturned to leave.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cKing City,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\npaper.\n\n \nGoodbye, waved the man, saying nothing.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never told me your name!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hand on door. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Elliott.\nA pleasure to make your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nThe door swung open, and shut. Jackie held the slip of paper in her\nhand, unsure for the first time in however long her life had been\nwhat to do next. She felt that her routine, unbroken for decades, had\nbeen disrupted, that something had gone differently. But she also had\nno idea why she felt that. It was just a slip of paper, just clutched\nin her hand. Just that.\n\n \nShe finished her paperwork. On the line that said Pawned by,\nshe stopped. She could not remember his name. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even\nremember his face. She looked down at the piece of paper.\n\n \nKing City\n\n \nShe looked up to get a glimpse of him out the window, just to jostle\nher stuck memory. From the counter, she could see the Man in the Tan\nJacket outside. He was running out to the desert. She could just\nbarely see him at the edge of the parking lot\xe2\x80\x99s radius of light. His\narms were swinging wildly, his suitcase swinging a long. His legs\nwere flailing. Great puffs of sand kicked up behind him. His head\nthrown back, sweat visible running down his neck, even from where she\nsat \xe2\x80\x93 the kind of run that was from something, and not\ntoward.\n\n \nThen he left the faint edge of the light, and was gone.'
