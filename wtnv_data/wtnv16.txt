Episode 16 - The Phone Call
b'Your existence is not impossible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also not very likely.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n In light of the ever-declining sales of newspapers, and the rise of competition from digital media, the Night Vale Daily Journal announced that it has developed a new business model. Publishing editor Leann Hart, speaking to television and internet reporters outside the burned-down shell of the Journal\xe2\x80\x99s former distribution plant, said their new mission, as a newspaper, is to kill news bloggers with hatchets.\n\n\n In this bold new initiative \xe2\x80\x93 a game-changing strategy by one of the industry stalwarts \xe2\x80\x93 the Daily Journal plans to just go to bloggers\xe2\x80\x99 homes and places of employment (with hatchets) and then chop them up (the bloggers) until they (the bloggers) are dead.\n\n\n She added that the Journal still plans to use the AP Style Guide and they are working to design a newer, more modern-looking masthead.\n\n\n Several Journal reporters and ad reps then began swinging blades at the non-print reporters in attendance.\n\n\n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police is issuing an urgent message to all citizens:\n\n\n ATTENTION ALL CITIZENS:\n\n\n Memorize this list. Memorize it now. It will not now, nor ever, be repeated. Memorize this list for your safety and protection. We cannot tell you when or where you will need to know it but when you do, you will be safe. Here is the list.\n\n\n Memorize.

Well, hey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk too much about my personal life here. This is your community news station, not Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s Personal Life Station, right?\n\n\n Okay, fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say it:\n\n\n \xe2\x99\xab Carlos! \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n Carlos, the dark, delicate-skinned scientist who came into our little town and our littler hearts several months ago.\n\n\n Well, I gave him my home phone number quite a while back, and he never called, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of it, right? I mean, sometimes people just don\xe2\x80\x99t call, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Well, to the point:\n\n\n Carlos calls, and I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x9cHello?\xe2\x80\x9d Like I don\xe2\x80\x99t even have caller ID!\n\n\n And he\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9cI need to talk to you. This is important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x9cUmm, OK.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty forward, right, listeners? But I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell exactly what he wants yet.\n\n\n And he said \xe2\x80\x9cCecil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Just the sound of his caramel voice!\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\xc2\xa0'
