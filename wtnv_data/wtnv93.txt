Episode 79 - Lost in the Mail
b'We brought something back with us,\nsomething we cannot escape: memories of a great vacation to deepest\nspace! And, the merciless Distant Prince.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Listeners, it is a solemn day here in\nNight Vale. Even more solemn than last year\xe2\x80\x99s Solemnity Fest, during\nwhich three people were overcome and had to be revived with party\nhats and whoopee cushions.\n\n Today is Remembrance Day, that\nspecial day once per year when we interrupt our routines to reflect\nupon those who probably sacrificed their lives for us in the endless\nBlood Space War. We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure whether they are alive or dead,\nbecause there is a thousand-year difference between our time and\nthose who fight for us on the vast intergalactic battlefields where\ntime converges.\n\n But, we assume that they are all\nheroes.\n\n On this day, we put aside our\npolitical differences \xe2\x80\x93 even deeply bitter, divisive differences,\nlike the belief or disbelief in mountains \xe2\x80\x93 and we all come\ntogether to remember those who will die thousands of years from now,\nand hope that the impossibility of victory is less impossible than\nbefore.\n\n Like any deeply painful and serious\nsubject, it is best remembered through the medium of a civic parade.\n\n Looking out of the studio I can see\nthe parade route is packed with onlookers, and everything is getting\nunderway. The symbolic dead lead the procession, each of them wearing\nthe mask of one of those who went into the distance of time and can\nnever return.\n\n Behind them is a float depicting the\nenormous serpent whose mouth contains the universe, a playful\nreminder to us all that even the stars must someday be swallowed.\n\n Following that apparition comes our\nmayor, and my friend, Dana Cardinal, in her ceremonial mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoffin.\n\n Behind her are the Citizens for a\nBlood Space War, still over 600 million dollars left to hit the\nfund-raising goal for their bomb that may destroy reality as we\nunderstand it. Get those cookies in the oven for the next bake sale!\n\n A brief departure now from the parade\nin progress.\n\n All this week, we have been reaching\nout to you, the listeners, and asking for stories about how the Blood\nSpace War has affected your lives. You heard from the Black Dauphin on\nhow to grow a victory garden inside your body, and Sarah Bismuth\nshared the story of her Etsy store where she sells dolls that\nrepresent individual soldiers in the Blood Space War, showing the\nactual wounds they will someday suffer.\n\n And now, today, in her own words, I\nbring you the story of a girl whose father volunteered to fight.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s listen together.\n\n [Sound of a tape player being\nstarted]\n\n Basimah:\nUh, I\xe2\x80\x99m Basimah Bishara and I am a junior at Night Vale High. My\nfather, Faqir Bishara, left to join the Blood Space War when I was\nsix.\n\n I\nremember the glowing doorway he stepped through when the tall,\nsilver-skinned recruiter came to our house, and the sound of it,\nlike, a slide whistle going up, but the most tragic slide whistle\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard. My dad was gone forever\xe2\x80\xa6but also, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t gone at\nall.\n\n I\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m a regular student\xe2\x80\xa6whatever that means. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t grown\nwings like the cheerleaders, but I fit in. I\xe2\x80\x99m bad at math. I mean, I\nused to be good at it, but I think I stopped paying attention. It\nseems like it was pointing toward a truth I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to learn.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nreally good at science and English. I used to be in marching band;\nnow I prefer guitar. Me and my friends formed an all-girl thrash\ngroup. We\xe2\x80\x99re called The Misfits.\n\n I\nguess how it works is that, once a year for the first hundred years\nof Dad\xe2\x80\x99s journey, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wake him up and allow him to send\na message back to Earth. I have a big family, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel loved.\n\n Sometimes\nI feel like it would be easier if my dad couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get in touch with\nme at all.\n\n No,\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish that. I love him!\n\n I\nwish he never left.\n\n The\nmessages show up on my night stand in these gelatinous gashapon\ncapsules. They are warm and soft in my hands. The words are printed\non a tiny roll of plastic inside.\n\n He\nonly gets to send one every year, and he always sends it to me right\naround my birthday, but not exactly on\nmy birthday. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he\xe2\x80\x99s getting it wrong or they are.\nOr, maybe, it\xe2\x80\x99s just time being weird again. I like to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\nthat.\n\n To\nmy dad, he left 11 days ago but to me, it\xe2\x80\x99s most of my lifetime. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe an old woman and he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be on his way to the war sending\nletters to a me that\nhe remembers from just a few weeks before.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nstupid.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot stupid, I guess.\n\n It\nis stupid, though. It is.\n\n [Sound of a tape player being\nstopped]\n\n Cecil:\nMore from Basimah in a bit, but we need to update you on the parade.\n\n Aah,\nhere comes The Emissary, listeners! It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Remembrance day\nwithout a visit from the only entity to ever return from the war. It\nhas been hauled up from the pit, and yes, here it comes!\n\n No\none knows what The\nEmissary is, or why\nThe Emissary inhabits a cosmonaut\xe2\x80\x99s suit.\n\n Oh!\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s lifting the visor and giving us a glimpse at the void within the\nhelmet. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s saying something! Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to interpret.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAll\nthese things are meaningless. End the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Well,\nof course, that\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point,\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it, listeners? If we end the war, it will go on eternally. We\nmust continue the war\nto bring it to an end. It\xe2\x80\x99s why all those brave people enlisted, and\nkeep enlisting, and will enlist forever.\n\n And\nthere goes The Emissary, a solemn reminder of why our volunteers\ncontinue to fight in the Blood Space War. Ah. What a brave being!\n\n Soon\nwe will trap it back in its pit.\n\n Speaking\nof those volunteers, the Night Vale Veterans of a Blood Space War\nAssociation is holding a fish fry this Saturday to raise money for a\nstatue of the unknown soldier, to be built 1,000 years in the future\n\xe2\x80\x93 by which time we may know who the soldier is. Bring friends,\nfamily, fish, and whatever else you would like fried over to the VFW\nHive located in the space between the walls at the abandoned cannery.\n\n Oh!\nUh, oh no! Uh, while I avert my gaze from the Shriner\xe2\x80\x99s homunculi,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s have a word from our sponsors.\n\n Do\nyou have dry eyes? Red eyes? Goat eyes? Aphid eyes? Any other eyes\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not currently using? We want your eyes at Richter\xe2\x80\x99s Eye Glass\nHut!\n\n We\ngive you money for your unwanted eyes and turn them into glass for\naffordable window panes.\n\n How?\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions.\n\n Come\non down to Richter\xe2\x80\x99s Eye Glass Hut, located conveniently off the\nhighway helix in the shadow of the immense precarious rock.\n\n No\nlonger accepting potato eyes or the eye of a storm. Not responsible\nfor our windows watching you while you sleep.\n\n And\nnow, let\xe2\x80\x99s return to Basimah\xe2\x80\x99s story.\n\n [Sound of a tape player being\nstarted]\n\n Basimah:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ship is so big,\nit makes me think of big things, Basi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat he calls me. It was my nickname when I was six.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nnot six.\n\n It\nall comes out of him at a jumble.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nsay what we are going to fight is an idea like a color or pride, but\nit can kill us. If the idea gets inside you, then it\xe2\x80\x99s over. Basi, do\nyou remember the song we used to sing you to put you to sleep? Paula\nAbdul, Rush\nRush.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen he wrote the whole song out, but he got a bunch of the lyrics\nwrong. I guess he was doing it from memory.\n\n I\ngot a capsule two months ago telling me he wants me to be a doctor so\nI can cure one of the big diseases like cancer. \xe2\x80\x9cLike cancer,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthere is nothing like\ncancer. There is just cancer.\n\n Sure,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll cure that, space-dad. No pressure, right?\n\n Most\nof the messages my father sends me are lists of ways I need to live\nmy life, things I should do and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, you know? He told me to\npray every day, and obey my mother. When I was nine he warned me not\nto kiss a boy until I was 16, which\xe2\x80\xa6well, I guess good news for him\nthere!\n\n Divergence\nstarted with little things. He said I should get a puppy for my\neighth birthday, but I got a snail. When I was 15, he wanted to make\nsure I had started wearing my hijab. Mom said I should make my own\nchoices, so sometimes I wear it, and sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Like, always\nat mosque, but not that often at school. That sort of thing.\n\n My\nfather is talking to a person who isn\xe2\x80\x99t me, to a person that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nexist. He has imagined my entire childhood and young adulthood. He\nbrings up obvious milestones, like starting high school or that first\nkiss, but\xe2\x80\xa6he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about that car accident I spent most of\nmy 14th year recovering from. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell him about the poems I\nwrite, or about the fact that I have a girlfriend, not a boyfriend.\n\n He\xe2\x80\x99s\na ghost to me and my mom. Or, maybe, since he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be around\nlong after I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who\xe2\x80\x99s a ghost to him.\n\n I\ntake some comfort knowing my dad got paid a lot\nof money for joining the Blood Space War. Enough to take care of me\nand Mom for a long time and, really, having a space-dad is just\nanother way to have a family. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s got their own thing, you\nknow?\n\n Like,\nall of The Misfits. Clara is in a nuclear family straight from the\n1950s but, like, literally\nfrom the 1950s, even as she lives her life in 2015. Neesha has a\ncouncil of fathers. Jacqueline\xe2\x80\x99s mom is a spider. So long as you are\nloved, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\n\n So\nmy dad\xe2\x80\x99s a space ghost. I can deal. I just wish Dad loved me,\nnot the me\nwho I was 11 years ago.\n\n Or\nmaybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not OK with it. Maybe I wish he would come back. I wish he\nwould be a dad to me, not to the ghost of me that haunts him.\n\n [Sound\nof a tape player being stopped]\n\n Cecil:\nMore with Basimah coming up, but first, the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cSharon\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Good\nSan Juan]\n\n The\nparade has ended. Most of the onlookers have ceased to look on, and\nthe wind is gathering up the paper Remembrance Day masks, and\ndepositing them in a random scattering across our sidewalks and\nstreets.\n\n A\nlone dog I recognize from a recurring dream is staring at me from a\nblock away. A dark van rumbles past. Everything is calm and quiet\nonce again and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Cecil\nis interrupted by a sound not unlike several flutes]\n\n Oh!\nOh, my!\n\n Oh!\nYou startled me.\n\n Uh,\nlisteners, The Emissary has appeared in the studio without\nwarning\xe2\x80\xa6without even opening a door. It is sitting in the chair\nnext to me and slowly rotating. Its visor is open, and I\xe2\x80\x99m being\nforced to stare at the ineffable darkness within The Emissary\xe2\x80\x99s\nhelmet.\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n Uh,\nI believe it is asking if I understand the nature of unreality.\n\n Um,\nEmissary, I understand dreams, and fantasies, and this gooey\nsometimes-incredible sometimes-painful world that surrounds us, but I\ncan only experience it with my seven senses.\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n Listeners,\nThe Emissary is saying that the nature of unreality is that\nexperience and reality are linked, but separate. What is experienced\nmay not be real. What is real may never be experienced.\n\n Well,\nso far this is just basic geometry, like we all learn in the third\ngrade. Where is The Emissary going with this?\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n The\nEmissary is saying\xe2\x80\xa6in a thousand years, we will turn the vastness\nof space red for no reason. There was never a purpose to this war we\nmade.\n\n But\xe2\x80\xa6if\nRemembrance Day has taught me anything, under strict order of the\nSheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police, it is that war is a purpose unto itself.\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n Um,\nThe Emissary is asking me to\xe2\x80\xa6end the conflict.\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n But\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsorry, Emissary, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I do not have the power to end the Blood\nSpace War. After all the blood that has been spilled in space, or\nwill\nbe spilled, or\xe2\x80\xa6may\nbe spilled at some theoretical point in the future, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m just a\nhumble radio host. And you\nare a sentient nothingness inhabiting the suit of a dead cosmonaut.\nHow could the two of us hope to stop a war? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\n\n I\njust don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n The\nEmissary is gone, as though it was never here. Maybe it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. After\nall, this moment was only something I experienced, not something I\nknow is real.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhear the rest of Basimah\xe2\x80\x99s tape.\n\n [Sound\nof a tape player being started]\n\n Basimah:\nPeople always say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be proud of your father going\noff to fight in the Blood Space War.\xe2\x80\x9d I used to say yes to that.\nNot anymore. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it makes me selfish or ungrateful, my\ndad made the wrong choice and I want him back.\n\n He\nwrote down the lyrics all wrong.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing to see, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna run, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna fly, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna bring this love\nback to you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes again]\n\n Ah!\nHow did you get in my room?\n\n [The\nsound not unlike several flutes continues]\n\n What\nare you?\n\n What\nare\nyou?\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6Daddy?\n\n Is\nthat you, Daddy?\n\n [Basimah\nlaughs]\n\n Daddy!\nDaddy!\n\n [Sound\nof a tape player being stopped]\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how The Emissary ended up in this taped\nrecording dropped off at the studio three days ago, given that The\nEmissary was only released from its pit this morning.\n\n But\nthen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how my favorite type of pie is made, but when I\norder it, there it is, steaming and delicious! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the\nmail gets delivered, but every day, like clockwork, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t! I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how lost pets end up on the moon! But they do. And they\nhave built an extensive city up there.\n\n The\nclock claims it is now 12:01. Remembrance Day is over. We can all\nreturn to our lives, and to forgetting that the Blood Space War is\ngoing on. Or\xe2\x80\xa6will\ngo on. Maybe. 1,000 years from now.\n\n And\nmaybe, in 1,000 years, plus a day or two, those brave volunteers we\nsent to fight in a war none of us understand will allow the most\ndangerous idea of all into their heads:\n\n They\nwill turn back, and return home, to us, against all laws of time and\nspace.\n\n Paraphrasing\nthe half-remembered words of an ancient prophet, perhaps they will\nbring this love back to us.\n\n Or,\nmaybe, they already have.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for events that will or will not happen in the order that\nthey may or may not occur.\n\n And\nfrom the present, as I am currently experiencing it, goodnight Night\nVale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Ever wondered how a plane flies? Well, the answer is that no\none knows. Pilots are scared to ask. If we ask, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99ll stop\nworking.'
