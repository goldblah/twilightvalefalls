Episode 38 - Orange Grove
b'You take the good, you take the bad. You take them both, and there you have spiders crawling out of a red velvet cupcake.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n We start today\xe2\x80\x99s show with some exciting agricultural news. John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 said his winter orange crop is outstanding this year! He said there are oranges everywhere! Delicious clementines, juicy Valencias, rich navels, and bold blood oranges.\n\n\n John said there are so many oranges, \xe2\x80\x9ca real bumper crop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA real orange-tacular,\xe2\x80\x9d he did notsay. \xe2\x80\x9cA real orange-a-thon,\xe2\x80\x9d he never would have said. \xe2\x80\x9cA real orange-ocalypse,\xe2\x80\x9d he may have thought, but kept to himself.\n\n\n John, speaking to a pack of local reporters, and backed by a group of farmers wearing black double-breasted suits and red silk ties, said this is the dawning of a new citrus economy in Night Vale.\n\n\n John said, \xe2\x80\x9cCitrus is our future. Citrus holds the key to prosperity. Citrus holds the key to health. One particular orange here literally holds the key to a one-sided door in the middle of the desert. If you find that orange,\xe2\x80\x9d John said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay you dearly for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOr rather,\xe2\x80\x9d John corrected himself, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will pay dearly for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Then John said, \xe2\x80\x9cEither way, whatever. Would love to have that orange, my friend. Would love to have that orange. Yessir!\xe2\x80\x9d he punctuated. \xe2\x80\x9cOr ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Or neither. I mean, whoever. Sure would love to have that orange,\xe2\x80\x9d he chuckled while sweating and adjusting his wooden hat.\n\n\n John then tossed some oranges to the reporters. The reporters caught the oranges, and then began to disappear. And reappear. Blinking in and out of existence, quickly at first, then slowly, then more out of existence than in, until they were all gone.\n\n\n More on this story as it develops.\n\n\n The City Council announced today that they just can\xe2\x80\x99t be here anymore. They said this in unison, standing in a cramped meeting room, and wearing tiny rectangular sunglasses.\n\n\n They added that they wish us all the best in our final weeks.\n\n\n Then, they made the standard American Sign Language \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\xe2\x80\x9d gesture as smoke filled the room.\n\n\n Witnesses said the smoke smelled of maple, and was a little briny, but not unpleasantly so.\n\n\n When the haze cleared, the City Council was still standing in the room, apologizing, claiming, \xe2\x80\x9cThis usually works.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, no longer speaking in unison, casting blame on each other for not believing hard enough, and that if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for so-and-so they\xe2\x80\x99d all be on a beach somewhere safe from the bears or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever those things are.\n\n\n When asked for an explanation about the bears\xe2\x80\xa6or whatever those things are, the Council simply whispered in unison, \xe2\x80\x9cMistakesssss!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n No follow-up questions were asked, as reporters became physically and emotionally occupied with the dozens of agitated starlings that began pouring from the air conditioning duct.\n\n\n You know, listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about John Peters\xe2\x80\x99 orange grove. I did a little digging online and found that orange trees are not native to deserts.\n\n\n I also emailed my boyfriend, Carlos, about this. He\xe2\x80\x99s a scientist, which kind of makes me a scientist, too.\n\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 email back to me just now:\n\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to answer your questions, but do know that I don\xe2\x80\x99t specialize in botany or dendrology. I am a scientist. I study science, not plants or nature.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI did drive out past John\xe2\x80\x99s farm a month ago, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single tree; just acres and acres of rocky, cracked, flat ground. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way he could have grown anything natural on that land, let alone a bountiful orange grove\xe2\x80\xa6especially in just a few weeks.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as your other question goes, let\xe2\x80\x99s stay home tonight. We ate out last night. Plus, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new documentary about scatterplot matrices on Netflix I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to see. Also, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is on TBS again. We could re-watch that.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll make pasta, if you can pick up some\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Uhmm, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, Carlos goes on about weekend bowling plans, y\xe2\x80\x93 you know what? You don\xe2\x80\x99t need all this.\n\n\n OK. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all he had about the orange trees.\n\n\n I do hope we watch Liberty Valance, though. Ha! I love that film.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n Tired of waiting in line at the Post Office? Scared of the unexplained blood pouring from the P.O. Boxes?

It\xe2\x80\x99s called J.P.\xe2\x80\x99s OJ, where the O in OJ is a bright cartoonish sun with big pink eyes, and a strained toothy smile; and the J is a sickle the sun is using to slice down ripe oranges from a large tree.\n\n\n Adam Bayer, weekday shift manager at the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, said they have removed all other produce to stock J.P. Oranges, and even emptied out the refrigerators to fully showcase all of J.P.\xe2\x80\x99s mouth-watering stock of fresh juice.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cEven several of the dry goods aisles had to be cleared out,\xe2\x80\x9d Adam said, pulling oranges from his apron pockets. He continued pulling oranges from his tiny pocket, mesmerized by their seeming infinitude, and unable to continue speaking as he began to blink out of existence.\n\n\n Listeners, we here at Night Vale Community Radio need to offer the following correction:\n\n\n In a previous broadcast, we described the world as \xe2\x80\x9creal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n We indicated, using our voice, that it was made up of many real objects and entities, and we gave descriptions of these disparate parts. We even went so far as to ascribe action and agency to some of these entities.\n\n\n But, as we all know, nothing can be fully understood to be \xe2\x80\x9creal.\xe2\x80\x9d Any description of the world we give is simply the world we experience \xe2\x80\x93 which is to say, a narrative we force onto whatever horror or void lies behind the scrim of our perception.\n\n\n We at the station offer our deepest, most humble apologies for the previous, erroneous, report. We affirm once again that nothing is real \xe2\x80\x93 including this correction, and least of all, your experience of hearing it.\n\n\n This has been Corrections.\n\n\n More now on the orange grove.\n\n\n Intern Maureen brought it to my attention that until today, John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 has been missing for about four months! Former intern Dana was the last to see him. Unfortunately, we do not know where Dana was when she saw him.\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re also unclear as to when Dana was, as time and space seem to not apply to Dana these days. She\xe2\x80\x99s been without a phone charger for about eight months now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re still texting. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how she\xe2\x80\x99s been paying her cell phone bill.\n\n\n Maureen? What is that? Maureen, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a glass of orange juice you\xe2\x80\x99re drinking, is it?\n\n\n Oh, I see. She got it from our station break room, not from the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably safe then.\n\n\n Oh, well, thank you for the offer, Maureen, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6still working on my coffee. [audibly sips]\n\n\n Maureen? Is everything OK?\n\n\n Listeners, Maureen is just\xe2\x80\xa6staring at me. Silent. A single bead of sweat running down her left temple. She is staring now at the orange juice. She is biting her upper lip with her lower jaw, and breathing through her nose. Her cheeks are flushing, and she is shaking her head, very\xe2\x80\xa6very slightly.\n\n\n That looks like a \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Is that a \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d Maureen?\n\n\n Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x93 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d from Maureen.\n\n\n Oh! Oh dear! Maureen just flickered. Like, she was there, and then she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and then she was, like when a plane flies in front of the sun and the light leaves for a brief moment as you wonder \xe2\x80\x93 for just that split second \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cIs this it? Is it over?\xe2\x80\x9d Only to have the sun return as your brain hears the faint hum of a distant jet and you sigh with relief and disappointment that everything is as it was. A similar thing just happened with Maureen.\n\n\n Listen\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Maureen, I\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n She is backing out of the studio.\n\n\n She is backing out of the studio.\n\n\n She has dropped the glass.\n\n\n She is flickering.\n\n\n She is flickering\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n She is gone.\n\n\n Listeners, Maureen is gone!\n\n\n I hear no hum of jets, I\xe2\x80\x93 I see no intern, just\xe2\x80\xa6an open door. And an empty glass, and a spreading stain.\n\n\n To the family of Intern Maureen: She was a good intern, with a beautiful puppy, and a chatty neighbor.\n\n\n She will be missed.\n\n\n [chime]\n\n\n Wait\xe2\x80\x93 uhh, I just got another email from Carlos, marked URGENT. He says:\n\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil? Just talked to my team of scientists, who have investigating the House that Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Exist \xe2\x80\x93 the one in the Desert Creek housing development that looks like it exists; like, it\xe2\x80\x99s right there when you look it and it\xe2\x80\x99s between two other identical houses, so it would make more sense for it to be there than not \xe2\x80\x93 that one.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey still have not gotten up the courage to go inside the house, but they did peek in the window and they saw John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 they saw John sitting in a chair in an empty room, staring at a picture on the wall. They could not see what was in the picture, but John was sitting quietly, staring at it, not moving.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey called his name, they tried dialing his phone, but he did not respond. They even knocked on the door\xe2\x80\xa6nothing.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever this \xe2\x80\x98John Peters\xe2\x80\x99 is, selling oranges and orange juice, is not the John Peters we know.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, I take it back, I think we should go out to eat tonight. I tried to go to the store, but they\xe2\x80\x99re completely out of pasta, tomatoes, herbs, scissors, fire, everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Well, now that is\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Listeners? Someone is pounding on the studio door, despite the brightly-lit ON AIR DO NOT DISTURB sign we always put out.\n\n\n Dear listeners, John Peters just came to visit!\n\n\n [deep breath]\n\n\n I should talk with him. Maybe this is a good time for us to go to the wea\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n No! Wait! Stop! John? John? No!\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cBlack White and Red\xe2\x80\x9d by Emrys Cronin]\n\n\n Listeners?\n\n\n Ugh!\n\n\n Listeners! What a fretful few moments we just had!\n\n\n John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the imposter? \xe2\x80\x93 he burst into our studio and tried forcing me to eat an orange. I attempted to reason with him, attempted to talk about our old bowling league, and the wood shop class he used to teach, I even asked him about the hilarious times we used to have standing silent and trance-like in front of the ancient Chalk Spire \xe2\x80\x93 predecessor to the current Brown Stone Spire \xe2\x80\x93 our mouths frothing, our minds spinning, our ventricles slowing\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n But John did not acknowledge any of these fond memories.\n\n\n As a last resort, with the orange nearing my face and my back pressing hard against the sharp edge of my broadcast table, I grabbed my phone to tell Carlos that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it home tonight, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love him, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch a documentary on special scientific graphs, or was too obsessed with my job to relax and enjoy a good meal and some television, it was only because I was zapped out of existence by a lunatic non-John Peters.\n\n\n And that, in fact, I do love Carlos, and I would want nothing more than to watch a documentary on scientific graphs over some homemade linguini, or to go out to eat again, or whatever!\n\n\n But then, as I grabbed my phone, I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cEh, that\xe2\x80\x99s way too long to write for a text,\xe2\x80\x9d so\xe2\x80\xa6I just hit John Peters upside the head with it, knocking him unconscious.\n\n\n And the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police came to carry the Fake John away, telling me that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything here\xe2\x80\xa6but then the StrexCorp-affiliated station management arrived, and asked the Sheriff and his Secret Police to stand down, and that they \xe2\x80\x93 the Secret Police \xe2\x80\x93 didn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything here, and to move along like nothing happened. The Secret Police nodded and quietly shuffled out of the building, heads facing down at their shoes.\n\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s still an empty O.J. Glass on the floor. The carpet around it is dark \xe2\x80\x93 not with liquid stain, but\xe2\x80\xa6with void.\n\n\n The spilled juice has taken the rug wherever it has taken Maureen, wherever it has taken the reporters, wherever it probably took the real John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer?\n\n\n Oh. My producer, Daniel, just gave me a disapproving smile as he handed me this note:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cStrexCorp Synernists Inc., majority shareholder of J.P.\xe2\x80\x99s OJ, Ltd., is recalling all oranges and juices due to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And here there\xe2\x80\x99s just a dark red smudge across the words.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cStrexCorp apologizes for any inconveniences, disappearances, lethargy, and/or multiplicity you may have experienced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n [chime]\n\n\n Oh, Carlos texted.\n\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo pasta, but there\xe2\x80\x99s leftover falafel and an unopened bag of nutmeg seeds to snack on. XOXO\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n And then there\xe2\x80\x99s an emoji of, uh, two dinosaurs chasing an early-80s Ford Mustang up a palmetto-lined suburban street as some residents look on, shocked and scared \xe2\x80\x93 a few laughing \xe2\x80\x93 others undisturbed as they mow their lawns or sculpt their fruit-shaped topiary bushes, oh man.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very cute!\n\n\n Listeners, let me release my own special announcement.\n\n\n Cecil Palmer would like to not be late for dinner.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for an hour that will feel like minutes but will, in actuality, take weeks.\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s Proverb: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single command from a satellite-activated mind control chip.\n\n\n Dinosaur emoji courtesy of Star-of-Rocks, used with permission.
