116 - Council Member Flynn, Part 3
b'Good hidden recording devices make good neighbors. Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Council member Tamika Flynn announced today that she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty comfortable doing this whole City Council thing, now that Night Vale is completely crime free. She announced this standing atop an onyx pyramid, waving a golden scepter. Mayor Dana Cardinal responded that while crime is clearly down, budgets for the new fiscal year have not been completed, and Night Vale is showing a marked financial loss this quarter, due in large part to strict evening curfews. She announced this silently into her journal, which she plans to publish as a scathing memoir some day. \n\n Sheriff Sam announced that the increased number of Secret Police officers has really had a positive impact on crime, but most of the police force now is volunteer or underpaid, and grossly unqualified. It\xe2\x80\x99s basically a bunch of random citizens with makeshift weapons carved out of tree branches or fashioned from broken blade-based kitchen appliances. The Sheriff noted that management of council member Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s citizen patrols has greatly impeded the capture of both the serial robber and the escaped librarian. Sheriff Sam quietly grumbled this into their bathroom mirror before finally putting on makeup and facing their day. \n\n Council member Flynn later said she received a postcard from the rest of City Council, who has been vacationing in Milstigan the past month. On the front of the postcard was a serene lake nestled among tall pines and speckled with herrings and fishing boats. Above the lake were eight Black Hawk helicopters, dangling each of the letters of the state name: M-I-B-S-T-I-C-A-N. On the back, the City Council had written: \xe2\x80\x9cSaw an article that Night Vale has the lowest crime rate. Guess you\xe2\x80\x99re doing fine without us and we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to come back.\xe2\x80\x9d The postcard continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned how to kayak and we bought a professional grade DSLR and learned to tie sailing knots. Michelin is awesome! Maybe we won\xe2\x80\x99t ever come back. Maybe we are not wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Council member Flynn said she wrote them back a postcard which she taped to a giant scorpion that read: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this under control. Happy apple picking.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Night Vale coroner Lorelei Alvarez issued her report today on the autopsy of the two bodies found at the green market co-op, which burned down last month in an apparent robbery-arson. These bodies are believed to be those of green market owner Tristan Cortez and his daughter Camilla, a business student at Night Vale Community College. Alvarez, however, said that without dental records for the Cortezes, she can\xe2\x80\x99t be certain that these bodies are theirs. The bodies had almost no burns on them, despite being found in a building leveled by fire. There were also no gunshot wounds. Alvarez said, \xe2\x80\x9cThese two bodies were wearing 19th century formal attire and had apparently been pecked to death by birds.\xe2\x80\x9d She added she had not ruled out that birds could have committed robberies, nor that the Cortez family had an anachronistic fashion sense. Alvarez added with a grin that she\xe2\x80\x99s also gotten a few bodies that had been mostly devoured by the escaped librarian. She said it\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating that librarians tend to eat only bones and ligaments, and not flesh or skin. So most of these corpses looked like rumpled soft leather sacks, which makes them much easier to store. Alvarez has so much more free space in her office now and has added a tetherball pole. \n\n And now sports. Tonight, the Night Vale High School Scorpions take on division rival Red Mesa Ant Carpenters in varsity wheelchair basketball. This afternoon, there will be a pep rally led by team captain Janice Palmer. Also she\xe2\x80\x99s my niece. The team captain is my niece. Councilwoman Tamika Flynn will also deliver a speech at the pep rally about the importance of teamwork and fighting crime with sports. Also, the importance of books. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know there are books about sports?\xe2\x80\x9d is the title of Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s speech. Flynn also requested, for reasons having to do with public safety, that the pep rally be moved away from the high school to the Old Night Vale armory, and that every person there stand exactly two feet apart and bring some type of shield and/or sharp object that could be used to fend off robbers or librarians. The pep rally is at noon. Go get\xe2\x80\x99em, Janice!\n\n Listeners, Mayor Cardinal and her director of emergency press conferences, Pamela Winchell, have called an emergency press conference to denounce the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s poor efforts to sustain the integrity and stability of Night Vale. Mayor Cardinal dismissed the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 essentially Tamika Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 curfew as virtually meaningless, now that more than half of the population is on the citizen patrol force. \xe2\x80\x9cWe basically have a town of municipally approved armed vigilantes walking around at all hours of the night.\xe2\x80\x9d Winchell seconded the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s point by adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I video myself sleeping? What am I hoping to discover? What secrets does my body whisper when I am unconscious?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Also, the president of the Night Vale school board, the giant glowing cloud who drops dead animals, made an impassioned speech in support of the Mayor via mind control. The entire crowd chanted: \xe2\x80\x9cAll hail the mighty Cloud who wants the lowly City Council to pass a budget that favors increased spending on education! We grovel before the almighty Cloud! How hard can it be to make a human budget? All hail!\xe2\x80\x9d they repeated.\n\n The Mayor said she\xe2\x80\x99s received many letters from people claiming they have lost their jobs as waiters, cab drivers, theatre managers and costumed superheroes because of the strict curfews. Night Vale Community host Cecil Palmer also announced today, live on his radio show, right now, that the curfew has been super productive for his TV watching, as he has already burned through every HBO and Showtime series. Plus all of \xe2\x80\x9cDifficult People\xe2\x80\x9d on Hulu, which features his second favorite actor, James Urbaniak. My favorite is, of course, Lee Marvin \xe2\x80\x93 may his name ring forever in eternity. \n\n Palmer added, at this very second, that while he\xe2\x80\x99s caught up on a lot of good television and is very excited for the new season of the documentary series \xe2\x80\x9cStranger Things\xe2\x80\x9d, he and his husband are getting a little stir crazy. There are only so many games of strip Uno a couple can play before they just wanna go out for a nice dinner and maybe a romantic stroll in the park. Councilwoman Flynn was not available for comment, although a sign above her locked office door said: \xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, reading a book on how to do financial spreadsheets\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n Listeners, I mentioned earlier my niece Janice and how proud I am of her for captaining her school\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team. But I\xe2\x80\x99m also a bit worried about her too. She looks perpetually exhausted. In the preseason tournament, she led all players in assists. She did everything she could to win games, but they just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite do it. Her statistics bear this out, but still she\xe2\x80\x99s taken on so much responsibility for the team\xe2\x80\x99s losses. Her Dad and team assistant coach, Steve Carlsberg, says Janice has increased her practice time to increase her fantastic passing skills, hoping to at least double the number of assists she gets. But Steve says that despite her better skills and more focused demeanor during practice, her team mates just aren\xe2\x80\x99t hitting their shots when she passes to them. She throws them the ball shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cShoot it! You\xe2\x80\x99re open, Julie!\xe2\x80\x9d But they miss over and over, even the ones named Julie. \n\n Steve is trying to convince her to work more on her defense and shooting, that assists aren\xe2\x80\x99t everything. But Janice got frustrated with this and called Steve selfish. \xe2\x80\x9cAssists are the most unselfish thing, Steve Carlsberg!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted before leaving the gym to pout by her locker earlier this morning. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I should just quit,\xe2\x80\x9d Steve heard her mumble. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s just a teenager fighting with her stepdad, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be all ready to go for today\xe2\x80\x99s pep rally. Which is set to start in a few minutes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with her later tonight to make sure she\xe2\x80\x99s doing OK. \n\n Councilwoman Tamika Flynn has arrived early for today\xe2\x80\x99s pep rally to deliver a brief statement about vigilance, self-preservation, and keeping our town crime free. Even though there\xe2\x80\x99s a librarian on the loose, and our Sheriff has yet to catch the serial robber, our streets are super safe,\xe2\x80\x9d Flynn said. \xe2\x80\x9cI read a book this morning about how low crime rates are excellent for local economies. The book is \xe2\x80\x98Lonesome Dove\xe2\x80\x99 by Larry McMurtry, in case you\xe2\x80\x99re interested.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLook around you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cno one here is being crimed upon, because we are protecting each other. We are watchful and observant.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAs my father once warned,\xe2\x80\x9d Tamika Flynn said, \xe2\x80\x9cbeware the robot uprising! Beware the machines that will bring us down! That\xe2\x80\x99s what he always told me before bed, and we must heed this words, Night Vale. At any moment, a great enemy could be upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d Tamika then said: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, it\xe2\x80\x99s after 12. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we supposed to start this pep rally? I\xe2\x80\x99m in the middle of Greg Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s literary masterpiece and winner of the Man Booker Price, \xe2\x80\x98Microsoft Excel for Dummies\xe2\x80\x99, so let\xe2\x80\x99s make this quick. I\xe2\x80\x99m really into that book,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded. \n\n But the crowd murmured, confused and agitated. The captain of the team was not there. And as they looked for the pep rally\xe2\x80\x99s leader, the bearer of the basketball torch, my niece, my only niece \xe2\x80\x93 the stage began to shake, the earth began to split, and smoke and dust are currently filling the Night Vale armory in choking plumes. Oh my god, Night Vale, where\xe2\x80\x99s Janice? Where is my niece? \n\n Listen to today\xe2\x80\x99s weather while I find out where she is. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cAnimal Skin\xe2\x80\x9d by Bryan Dunn]\n\n The rest of the City Council has returned to Night Vale. They burrowed through the earth and up through the floor of the armory where the pep rally was being held. They apologized for the dramatic and destructive entrance, but their flight out was really turbulent and there was no meal service. So they thought they\xe2\x80\x99d take the slower, but more comfortable route home. The multi-limbed, multi-voiced, single-bodied entity of the City Council was wearing a T-shirt that said: \xe2\x80\x9cMitchigan \xe2\x80\x93 America\xe2\x80\x99s sexiest forests\xe2\x80\x9d, featuring little cartoon tees with ribbed abs and bubble butts. The City Council then presented two people whose hands were bound with ropes, tied off tight with perfect bowline nuts. It was Tristan Cortez and his daughter, Camilla. The City Council said they found the Cortezes while rock climbing. According to the City Council, Camilla had devised an insurance scam, which Tristan set up by committing a series of small armed robberies around Night Vale, to make the robbery and the subsequent arson of their new store more believable. They stole two bodies from the old cemetery, which flooded last month, and laid those in the burned-out husk of their former market to fake their deaths. Camilla created a fake ID for a sister she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have, named Tamilla, who lived in Mistrigen, where they planned to live out life bird watching and parasailing in the paradise of America\xe2\x80\x99s most hand shaped state. The City Council laid out this entire plot, as they presented Sheriff Sam with the two fraudsters. Then the City Council turned to their newest member, Tamika Flynn and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe also completed the new city budget,\xe2\x80\x9d as they dropped a six-inch high stack of papers, like it was a mic at a poetry slam. \n\n And even better, listeners: Janice finally arrived. We found her! After the City Council made their speech, the basketball team captain stepped to the mic and said she was running late today because she was practicing so hard to be a better passer, to have more assists, to be empirically the best team mate that the league record books have ever seen. But then, just this morning after a fight with her stepdad, she realized she was wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t measure leadership,\xe2\x80\x9d Janice said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been so worried about that one number, that one datum that seems so selfless. But the act of pursuing that number is in itself selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d Janice said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do this all on my own. I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect everyone else to score thinking I\xe2\x80\x99m being helpful. Each one of us has a different skill set, and as your captain, I want you to be great at scoring, defense, rebounding, whistling, and the occasional hex \xe2\x80\x93 the five pillars of sound basketball. So let\xe2\x80\x99s get out there and beat Red Mesa!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n The crowd cheered and joined together to sing the Night Vale school song, \xe2\x80\x9cYou Walk with Me, You Walk Alone under an Indifferent Dust-filled Sky\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n Tamika then spoke. She stood before her fellow citizens, her constituents, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI want the best for all of us, I really do. I\xe2\x80\x99m new at this, and the one thing I know how to do well, really well, is fight, and I want that for everyone. Also read, I\xe2\x80\x99m awesome at reading. I want that for you too. Government jobs are weird because you can\xe2\x80\x99t really fight a lot of crime. You mostly do paperwork and have meetings and scan retinas. Government is evasive and stupid and slow, and it\xe2\x80\x99s because there are so many people it has to account for. And I realize it takes lots of time and lots of people to change. I just want this to change. I want us to feel safe. I also want to finish this amazing novel about Microsoft Excel, it is so compelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n At the behest of Tamika Flynn, the City Council voted unanimously to lift the town-wide curfew. And restaurants have already began to reopen, as well as theaters, public parks, clothing stores and bloodstone circle repair shops. Even the library has reopened with plans to renovate the security gates and triple barred cages that keep the librarians safely away from society. And with the return of library activities, escaped librarian Dan McDowell even returned to his former job, promising not to eat anyone else, unless they were trying to check out a book. The City Council also voted to keep all the city buildings painted blood red, because quote, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s intimidating AF.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they tried to vote to change the town motto to \xe2\x80\x9cNight Vale \xe2\x80\x93 Intimidating AF\xe2\x80\x9d. But it lost by a single deciding vote, which belonged to Tamika, who said we should pace ourselves. She then quoted Jean-Jacques Rousseau: \xe2\x80\x9cPatience is bitter, buts its fruit is mad sweet, like a swole grape.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Sheriff Sam praised the City Council for capturing these criminals. Mayor Cardinal praised the City Council, too, but she added praise specifically for Tamika Flynn. Mayor Cardinal said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud of you, Councilwoman Flynn. I did not agree with your tactics, but I think your heart is in the right place. It will take time, but we can do this.\xe2\x80\x9d Tamika accepted the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s kind words and a comforting embrace, and then returned to her office to finish her novel about spreadsheets. \n\n Night Vale, Janice and Tamika are growing up before our eyes, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prouder of either. But more importantly, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more excited to get out of the house! Carlos and I are headed straight to dinner at the Shallow Grave, and then going dancing at that new club, Numb, which opened up mere minutes after the curfew was lifted. \n\n Stay tuned next to the sound of two men putting on just the most vicious outfits. \n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: We are all (an elite few) in this (a secret underground emergency bunker) together (on our own without public knowledge).'
