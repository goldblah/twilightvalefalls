Episode 43 - Visitor
b"Listen to your heart. You can hear it, deep under the earth, creaking and heaving, with roots snapping and birds flapping quickly away.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Listeners? There\xe2\x80\x99s a visitor in my studio today! No one you know. No one I know. Not even a thing\xc2\xa0you or I know. It is\xe2\x80\xa6umm, I am unsure what it is, let me describe it.\n\n\n Imagine a duck. But just the eyes.\n\n\n No, larger than that. Really large duck eyes.\n\n\n Now imagine fur. Puffy fur, like a bear cub. Soft, and tan, and a thick round belly, and no real discernible arms or legs, just\xe2\x80\xa6little nubs that flit about as it slowly moves across the floor.\n\n\n Oh my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s adorable! I wish you could see this thing.\n\n\n [gasps]\xc2\xa0Oh! It just made a noise! Oh, did you hear that, listeners? Like\xe2\x80\x93 like a mouse squeak meets a bike horn, meets a sincere question about love.\n\n\n Oh, what a cute surprise!\n\n\n Many of you remember a couple years back, we here at the station found a stray cat in the men\xe2\x80\x99s restroom. We named him Khoshekh. Khoshekh is still in the men\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom as he always has been \xe2\x80\x93 and presumably always will be \xe2\x80\x93 hovering exactly four feet off the ground at a fixed point in space. Khoshekh has been a real anchor for us here at the station. We built him a special litter box and feeding dish because of his\xe2\x80\xa6distinctive physical state, and I have just been in love with that cat. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a cat guy, but\xe2\x80\xa6Khoshekh? Ah! He\xe2\x80\x99s the sweetest boy!\n\n\n Now, this new\xe2\x80\xa6whatever, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move much, his big dark eyes, oh God, they\xe2\x80\x99re so charming! Just\xe2\x80\xa6staring, pleading!\n\n\n Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really doing much. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s scared. Let\xe2\x80\x99s let it be for now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get us to the news.\n\n\n Controversy is plaguing the mayoral race here in Night Vale. After Pamela Winchell announced her surprise resignation from the post last Spring, two front-runners for Night Vale mayor have been polling neck and necks. The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, and Hiram McDaniels, who is literally a five-headed dragon.\n\n\n Supporters of the Faceless Old Woman are claiming that, while officially acquitted of insurance fraud, evidence suggests that Hiram is in possession of a stolen truck. They checked the registration of his vehicle, and found that it belonged to one Frank Chen, who was found dead nearly two years ago. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s body was covered in claw and scorch marks, and the coroner gave the cause of death as \xe2\x80\x9cDragon, at least three heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Hiram denies that he stole the truck, and says that Frank is a friend, and is totally not dead.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFrank was probably just fooling around with all those weird injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d McDaniels claimed.\n\n\n His campaign fired back at the Faceless Old Woman, saying that since her origin is lost to distant history, and she has no birth certificate, she\xe2\x80\x99s not able to prove that she\xe2\x80\x99s an American citizen.\n\n\n Election day is June 15th. Votes will be cast, but not tabulated, as the mayor is of course decided by counting and interpreting the loud pulses coming from Hidden Gorge.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look now at traffic.\n\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s a silver pickup, full-sized, well-worn, tall. Long. The windows are gray with dried dirt. The tires are lined with firm tread.\n\n\n Inside sits a man. Full-sized. Well-worn. Tall. He has a hat, and some denim. His face is lined with firm tread.\xc2\xa0His mind is gray with history.\n\n\n He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember things. This does not mean he can\xe2\x80\x99t, it means he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. He just looks at what is in front of him. He deals only in the present. The past dictates his disposition, but the present is the only thing he can see.\n\n\n Cars. People. Animals. Trees. Mud. A telephone. A telephone that rings, sometimes. A telephone that rings and shows a name he knows, but he does not pick up. That name is not part of his present.\n\n\n Forgiveness and memory are too inextricable to, say, answer a phone.\n\n\n Brake lights. He slows, he drives carefully. He drives in the moment. He is a good driver. He is good at lots of things.\n\n\n The phone rings. He is not good at everything.\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n Wow, this little creature is so shy! I tried placing a cup of water on the floor, but it just won\xe2\x80\x99t move! It just\xe2\x80\xa6stares at me from the corner, with its giant duck eyes. Just stares at me, motionless.\n\n\n Really cute, though.\n\n\n Wait \xe2\x80\x93 I think it moved!\n\n\n Here boy!\xe2\x80\xa6or girl!\xe2\x80\xa6or either! Come get some water! Come here! You\xe2\x80\x99re so cute! So so so so so cute!\n\n\n Nope. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. But its eyes followed me as I moved in my chair. Or\xe2\x80\xa6did they?\n\n\n They\xe2\x80\x99re just solid black, all pupil, like umm\xe2\x80\xa6a what? A spider? Well that\xe2\x80\x99d be weird. There are some other dark dots around its face. Could be eyes, but\xe2\x80\xa6no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it's\xe2\x80\x93 ooh! Wait! That noise again! Listen!\n\n\n Oh! Well, whatever it is, it is cuuute! Or, weirdly cute! Or just weird. Ugh! Uh! OK.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at the Community Calendar.\n\n\n This Wednesday night, the Night Vale Community Theater will be holding auditions for the musical \xe2\x80\x9cInto the Woods.\xe2\x80\x9d Interested thespians should bring night-vision goggles, glass cutters, a breathable ski mask, and quiet shoes to the First Night Vale Bank.\n\n\n On Thursday, the Museum of Forbidden Technologies will open their new exhibit, called \xe2\x80\x9cThought Crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Anyone who attends the exhibit is obviously interested in learning about forbidden technologies, and will be arrested immediately. Tickets are available on the museum website, and\xe2\x80\xa6here\xe2\x80\x99s a tip: They can\xe2\x80\x99t arrest you for buying tickets if you\xe2\x80\x99re in your own home. They can, however, use tear gas to flush you out, and then arrest you.\n\n\n Friday afternoon, the staff of Dark Owl Records will be wearing black pants and chain mail veils.\n\n\n Saturday night is the grand opening of Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s newest restaurant, Tourniquet, featuring Executive Chef LaShawn Mason, who was previously a sous chef for Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s top-rated fine dining establishment, Shame.\xc2\xa0LaShawn hopes to bring classical French cooking into the 21st century, with a mix of molecular gastronomy and human remains.\n\n\n Tourniquet offers a prix fixe menu for $35, featuring choice of appetizer, entree, dessert, and sudden awareness of a hideous suppressed memory.\n\n\n Sunday morning is. Period. It just is.\n\n\n OK, listeners, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve finally got this thing to trust me. It waddled over here just a moment ago, oh so cute the way its bulbous square of a body moves! It came right up to me and let me pet it! I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m petting it now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6purring? I think? Or\xe2\x80\xa6humming? Or\xe2\x80\xa6buzzing?\n\n\n Oh! What a cuddly little addition to our station this thing will make!\n\n\n Umm, what should we name it? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if it\xe2\x80\x99s a boy, or a girl, or\xe2\x80\xa6maybe genderless, like the future humans who visited Night Vale in the 1950s, with their time travel technology, which was then outlawed until last y\xe2\x80\x93 [gasp]\n\n\n Oh my God, listeners! It\xe2\x80\x99s hugging my leg! IT\xe2\x80\x99S HUGGING MY LEG!! This is the cutest thing!\n\n\n I have got to get a photo of this. Um, let me get my phone from my bag\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n If I could just\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Oh, God! You\xe2\x80\x99re really heavy! I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to move from this spot here, uh, ladies and gentlemen, and the little guy \xe2\x80\x93 or gal \xe2\x80\x93 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to let go!\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re so strong! Yes you are! Yes you are!\n\n\n [clears throat]\n\n\n Huh.\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve received an update from Carlos and his team of scientists about the House that Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Exist, the one in the Desert Creek Development. It looks like it exists \xe2\x80\x93 like it\xe2\x80\x99s right there when you look at it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s between two other identical houses, so it would make more sense for it to be there than not. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually exist.\n\n\n The scientists have been carefully monitoring John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer \xe2\x80\x93 who has been standing alone in the house for weeks. The house is completely empty, except some photographs on the wall. Each one seems to be of a lighthouse.\n\n\n The scientists, long too scared to open the door, finally got the nerve to go up to the house and try. It was locked. They shook the handle, hard at first, violently at second, pounding and yelling at third. And those observing John from the window saw no change in his behavior. The door slammed open, and a woman answered.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted at the scientists.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\xa6wanted to see what that man was\xe2\x80\xa6doing in there?\xe2\x80\x9d one of them meekly replied.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI live alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And looking in from the front door, they could see a room of the same shape and size as the one John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer \xe2\x80\x93 had been standing in. The room was full of chairs, and a couch, and plants, and a table, and photographs\xe2\x80\xa6but none of lighthouses. Most of faces. Faces similar in form to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s at the door.\n\n\n The scientists who were at the window could see John standing in the empty room, looking at lighthouses. The woman said her name was Cynthia, and she\xe2\x80\x99d lived there for 19 years.\n\n\n The scientists left her alone, returning quietly to the lab.\n\n\n Carlos added that the Desert Creek Housing Development was only three years old\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Ow! Ow! Oh, Go\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Listeners, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\xe2\x80\xa6bitten by this thing!\n\n\n Oh\xe2\x80\x93 Oh God! Ow! I can see blood!\n\n\n Ge\xe2\x80\x93 Get off! Get off!\n\n\n Ow!\n\n\n Ooh! Gooooh!\n\n\n I need to go wash this. Um, let\xe2\x80\x99s go now to a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n Are you achieving your fullest potential? Are you finding the right solutions for your challenges? Are you making the most of what you\xe2\x80\x99re given? Do you believe in a Smiling God?\n\n\n Of course you do! We all do. We must!\n\n\n Well, what if I told you the Smiling God was smiling more than ever? What if the Smiling God had a smile so wide that you could see yourself in its mirrored teeth? And what if I told you that your gauzy reflection looked perfect \xe2\x80\x93 just perfect?\n\n\n You would like that. Of course! We all would. We must!\n\n\n And what if I told you you\xe2\x80\x99re perfect self hated your imperfect self? And as the Smiling God smiled wider, you could see a tongue pressing through the teeth \xe2\x80\x93 thick, and pink, and gray, and wet.\n\n\n And what if I told you you could see your imperfect self in the shining sheen of the bulging tongue? And in your reflection you were slack and sallow? And maybe bleeding. A lot.\n\n\n Bleeding so much!\n\n\n And what if I told you you could kill your imperfect self?\n\n\n What if I told you you could achieve your fullest potential?\n\n\n StrexCorp Synernists Inc. is a proud supporter of the greater Desert Bluff and Night Vale community.\n\n\n StrexCorp. Believe in a Smiling God.\n\n\n Believe in your perfect self.\n\n\n Strex.\n\n\n Strex.\n\n\n\n\n Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m on my cell phone calling from the men\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. I had intern Jeremy patch me into the board so I can still broadcast. That\xe2\x80\xa6thing tried to follow me in here as I limped down the hall. I was able to outrun it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to use the deadbolt on the bathroom door to keep it out.\n\n\n All this talk about Khoshekh today, and here he is. Hi, baby boy! That thing is nothing at all like you! It\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n [crashing sound]\n\n\n The door\xe2\x80\x99s come off it\xe2\x80\x99s hinges! It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten in! I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna duck into this stall.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m peering now under the walls, and seeing nothing.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m standing now on the commode, and looking over the walls, and see nothing!\n\n\n Listeners, the only thing more terrifying than seeing the devil is no longer being able to see the devil!\n\n\n Perhaps I should be quiet.\n\n\n Intern Jeremy? Can you, one: call Animal Control, and two: take us now to the weath\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n What was that?\n\n\n No! No no!\n\n\n Khoshekh!\n\n\n What have you done to my cat, you monster!\n\n\n Jeremy! Take us to the weather!\n\n\n You come here, you son of a\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cCover Me Up\xe2\x80\x9d by Jason Isbell]\n\n\n Listeners? Oh, God, listeners!\n\n\n Khoshekh has been hurt. Very badly.\n\n\n Animal Control came and took him to a hospital. They think he will live. They think he will live\xe2\x80\xa6differently. They think there will be significantly less of him physically, and mentally, but he will live.\n\n\n He is my boy. He is my buddy! I love him so much. And this\xe2\x80\xa6thing, this thing, comes here, and\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Yes. Yes. Let me tell you about this thing, this awful beast.\n\n\n After I saw it tear Khoshekh from his fixed point, and bite into his side, I\xe2\x80\x93 I kicked it, and I kicked it again, and Jeremy helped me pin it down, and Animal Control tried to sedate it, and I wanted to beat it to death with a hammer, but I had no hammer. Only self control.\n\n\n Animal Control tried to inject it with their delicious poisons, but they stopped. They said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t. We can\xe2\x80\x99t inject. It is a machine!\xe2\x80\x9d And they flipped its switch and it died.\n\n\n I have never been so relieved to be safe and so\xe2\x80\xa6disappointed to be shorted my vengeance.\n\n\n Our new program director, Lauren, came in and wanted to know why we destroyed my gift.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMy gift?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDaniel and I and the whole StrexCorp management team got you that StrexPet, because we know you love animals so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a machine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cA bio-machine,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not my birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d I mumbled, as Animal Control took Khoshekh Away.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go now. Go see my Khoshekh.\n\n\n He should be out of surgery in half an hour or so, and\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will live. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will float again at a fixed point exactly four feet up in the men\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom of our community radio station. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is vengeance to be found! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I will find it!\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I just have to find the right recipient.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for the sound of your own thoughts, broadcast live on the radio for all to hear.\n\n\n And, as always, goodnight, Night Vale! Goodnight!\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: You won\xe2\x80\x99t sleep when you\xe2\x80\x99re dead, either."
