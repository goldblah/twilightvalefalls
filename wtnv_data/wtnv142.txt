Let me count your teeth. \n\n Happy All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve, Desert Bluffs!\n\n [Desert Bluffs theme]\n\n Kevin: Hi listeners! It\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin!\n\n Lauren: And Lauren!\n\n Kevin: We hope you\xe2\x80\x99re all having the smilingest All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve you could have ever wished for.\n\n Lauren: Desert Bluffs 2, welcome to our holiday show, where we re-tell classic story of All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve.\n\n Kevin: [excited noise] We\xe2\x80\x99ll also have great last minute gift ideas and cooking tips! But first, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look around town to see how people are celebrating this most wonderful of holidays.\n\n Lauren: Of course, our old city of Desert Bluffs is no more. It\xe2\x80\x99s been swallowed up by the town of Night Vale, but we found a new home here in the Desert Otherworld!\n\n Kevin: We\xe2\x80\x99re broadcasting now from the scenic lighthouse atop a tall mountain. Looking out over endless, sand-covered nothingness. \n\n Lauren: I like the sand. It\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite part of living here.\n\n Kevin: I like the nothingness.\n\n Lauren: It really clears the mind. But there are moments of something-ness. And there are beautiful displays of lights and crafts. Oh, Frank Donnelly, who lives atop the northwest bluff, has strung up a series of colorful gasoline canisters over his storefront, where he sells tarantula parts. At dusk, he sets each can on fire, and the burning plastic just melts away spilling down on the people below. [chuckles] Alejandra Salazar, who lives in a cave just to the south base of this mountain, has painted lips and teeth around the entrance to her home! [chuckles] And my favorite holiday decoration this year is (Kunit Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s) smile tree.\n\n Kevin: Ohh!\n\n Lauren: Mm hm, she\xe2\x80\x99s built a 20-foot tall cactus out of human teeth! [chuckles] She even used coyote skins turned inside out to look like flowers.\n\n Kevin: [moved] Ah, I love people\xe2\x80\x99s creativity this time of year! It\xe2\x80\x99s so fun to walk around town and see the night lit up with seasonal joy. To smell the burning petroleum products, to hear the screams and feel the warm fire in the cool dry air. \n\n Lauren: You truly do love the holidays.\n\n Kevin: [coos] Lauren, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to tell the story of All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve! \n\n Lauren: Ye-he-hee, let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\n\n Kevin: Once, there was a family, the Goods, who lived in the desert. Two mothers, a father, a daughter, a son, three dogs, the front half of a cat and a very long house. They were a happy family, but no one knew it. People would often say to them, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be so happy if you just smiled,\xe2\x80\x9d but the Good family would always say \xe2\x80\x9cWe are smiling, we are happy!\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s just that no one could see their smiles. Their faces always remained in a neutral state. Even the Good family couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell when each other were smiling. Each one thought the other was unhappy, because none of them had a visible smile. Sometimes the mothers would ask their younger child: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you sad, Felicia?\xe2\x80\x9d and Felicia would say: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sad, mothers!\xe2\x80\x9d And then Felicia would smile, and her mothers would smile, but none of them appeared to be smiling to each other, and they would all remain sad.\n\n Sometimes the father broke things on purpose, like vases or the children\xe2\x80\x99s toys, or the children\xe2\x80\x99s toy vases, or birds. It brought him great joy breaking things, because it reminded him that he was autonomous. But to the outside eye, it looked like an expressionless man smashing random objects. The older child, Jason, had a piece of lumber he carried around with him always. It was a banister from an old stairwell railing, and he loved it! He had named it Jason also, because it reminded him of himself, and he would dress the stick in similar shirts and pants. Felicia asked him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you dress like that stick, Jason?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me happy,\xe2\x80\x9d Jason said. \xe2\x80\x9cSee? See how I smile, sister?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \n\n Their neighbors and friends wanted the Goods to be happy. And they were. But they could not smile. The Goods though they were smiling, but they were not. No one knew how to solve the problem, because no one knew what the problem was. \n\n Lauren: [sadly] Ohh. This part makes me slightly less happy than I always am. \n\n Kevin: [sadly] Oh yes. When people don\xe2\x80\x99t smile, everyone else has to smile even harder.\n\n Lauren: I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear how the story ends. But now, let\xe2\x80\x99s share some of our favorite holiday dishes! \n\n Kevin: Ooohohohooo! \n\n Lauren: [chuckles] Yeah. I know you all out there are busily preparing your All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Day meals. Kevin, what is your favorite dish? \n\n Kevin: Ooo! When I was a boy, my father used to make caramel. He would pour a whole bag of sugar into a large pot and put it over the highest heat. Then he would stir and stir, slowly mixing in heavy cream, until the sugar liquefied and toasted. Then, [coos] as the syrup came to a boil, he would call the kids into the kitchen and we would all open our hands, and he would pour the boiling caramel into our cupped palms! Ooh, it burned our hands so badly, but that was no problem, because we just forced the sweet caramel quickly into our mouths, where it also badly burned our tongues and lips. Ooh! It was one of my happiest memories!\n\n [solemnly] Years later, when I was an adult, I found a starling in a shopping center parking lot. Its head had been crushed by a car tire, and its rear leg was still twitching. I watched it for about\xe2\x80\xa6 15 minutes, until it stopped moving. \n\n Lauren: Thanks for that recipe, Kevin! Hah! My favorite holiday dish is radish casserole. It\xe2\x80\x99s really easy to make. You just pull the stems off, then using a peeler you remove the red skin. Then, place the radish in a food processor and blend it until it\xe2\x80\x99s a stiff paste. Pour onto a plate and voil\xc3\xa0, ha ha!\n\n Kevin: [solemnly] I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know who killed that starling. \n\n Lauren: Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue with our story of All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve. The Good family began treating themselves more gently, considering that perhaps they maybe were dealing with something more serious than just a lack of happiness. One mother told the other mother that depression and anxiety are more common than we think, and the other mother said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe should listen to each other more and try to better understand our pain.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPain is something we can all understand,\xe2\x80\x9d the father said, and he pointed to the half-cat under the shrubs, which they had adopted last month when they found it decomposing on their lawn. They named the half cat Mr. Doodles. [chuckles] \xe2\x80\x9cAwww!\xe2\x80\x9d The whole family cooed. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Doodles!\xe2\x80\x9d They all smiled, unnoticeably. \n\n Jason and Felicia wanted their friends to know they were happy, so they began practicing smiling in the mirror, but even they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a change in their faces. Plus, mirrors were upsetting because of all the people who would gather behind them in the reflection, that weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually there when they turned around to face them. \n\n But one day, the Good family\xe2\x80\x99s life would change. Because they would meet \xe2\x80\x93 the Smiling God!\n\n Kevin: Oooooooooooo-o-o-oo..\n\n Lauren: [laughing hysterically] I know (\xe2\x80\x93)..\n\n Kevin: Laureeeeeeen, I love this part! We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back with more of the story in a moment. But let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about some last minute gift ideas. \n\n Lauren: I know a lot of you out there waited until the last possible moment to buy your All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Day gifts. But not to worry, because there are plenty of meaningful gifts you can get right now.\n\n Kevin: You could even make something. People enjoy receiving handcrafted gifts from loved ones. For instance, Lauren, I bought some yarn and then\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Lauren: Aha? \n\n Kevin: Hand-knitted you this sweater?\n\n Lauren: Awww, Kevin!!! [chuckles] It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, i-i-it\xe2\x80\x99s covered in\xe2\x80\xa6 are these worms? \n\n Kevin: Sure are! I bought those at the bait shop.\n\n Lauren: Amazing. And Kevin, I bought you some cologne!\n\n Kevin: I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear cologne.\n\n Lauren: That\xe2\x80\x99s when I bought you cologne. I special ordered it from a parfumerie in Frenchia. It\xe2\x80\x99s called (\xe2\x80\x93) [0:11:05]. I can see by your grin that you love it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll spray some on you.\n\n Kevin: [gleefully] Oh, it burns!! \n\n Lauren: Hahaha! It\xe2\x80\x99s acid. \n\n Kevin: Look at all the little bubbles forming on my wrist! Ah, I can see my veins! \n\n Lauren: Listeners, you may not have time to knit a sweater and staple live worms to it, or special order a foreign cologne\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Kevin: Ooohoohoo..\n\n Lauren: But here are a few ideas to help you out in your last minute gift buying. People love animals. Maybe buy them a dog. Or how about a coupon book full of chores you\xe2\x80\x99ll do for them, like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll clean the dishes for one whole month\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll beginning you for my life\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sharpen your teeth while you sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Kevin: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those are great gift ideas, Lauren. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listening because my arm hurts so much. Ooh, let\xe2\x80\x99s continue with our story of All Smiles\xe2\x80\x99 Eve.\n\n Lauren: OK. \n\n Kevin: One day, the Good family felt hot. They lived in the desert because they loved feeling hot, so this made them very happy. Their feet burned, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold still, they leapt up and down to keep their feet from being completely scorched, and it looked like a dance. They were joyously happy, they smiled and smiled, but to anyone watching, they looked like the saddest dances ever. \n\n They heard a loud pop, as the sand raound their hoem burst skyward and th Smiling God emerged. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIii am the Smiling Goood,\xe2\x80\x9d the Smiling God said. And the Good family\xe2\x80\x99s ears began to melt away. They clutched at their heads, screaming. They had never felt so happy.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhyy are you not haappyy?\xe2\x80\x9d The God asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYouu shoould bee happyy!\xe2\x80\x9d the God demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are!\xe2\x80\x9d the Good family insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cSee us smiling?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNoo!\xe2\x80\x9d The God said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut soon I wi-ill!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n And the Smiling God told them about purity and about devouring. The Smiling God showed the family a PowerPoint presentation on the subject of purity, even though PowerPoint, let alone computers, would not be invented for more than a century. The Good family happily watched the Smiling God\xe2\x80\x99s lecture. They smiled imperceptibly through the whole thing. And the Smiling God grew furious, because it could not see how happy they were. The Smiling God said to the Good family, saying \xe2\x80\x9cBehold! You will smile so much, you will never want to stop!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n The Good family said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are smiling!\xe2\x80\x9d But the Smiling God had already devoured their home in one heaving gulp. All that remained was a smoldering pit and scattered debris. Jason, the boy, found splinters of Jason the stick. Mr. Doodles was now only a fourth of a cat. \xe2\x80\x9cAwww,\xe2\x80\x9d the whole family cooed, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Doodles!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Their long house was a long \xe2\x80\x93 pit. And every single mirror in their home was gone, along with the ghastly figures who gathered in the reflections. And the Good family was so happy and so afraid. They concentrated hard on making the biggest smiles they could, but the Smiling God could not see their pure joy on their bland faces.\n\n Lauren: [sadly] Oh! Oh oh oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear the end of this story, Kevin. But for now, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to today\xe2\x80\x99s weather. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cFast Talker" corners="" could="" course.="" covering="" dad,="" debris="" definitely="" desert="" devoured="" did="" did.="" died.="" difficult="" disappointed="" discernible,="" do="" dogs="" done,="" door="" down="" each="" ear="" ear.="" earth.="" entire="" eve="" eve,="" ever="" ever-widening.="" every="" everyone="" everything="" expression="" face="" family="" family.="" father="" feet.="" felicia="" felicia,="" felt="" find="" flash="" fluttered="" food="" fool="" for="" fox="" fragment="" frame="" frame,="" framed="" friends!="" from="" front="" get="" give="" glass="" god="" god&rsquo;s="" god,="" good="" gooey.="" got="" grabbed="" grins.="" gums.="" had="" half="" hands="" happiness.="" happy="" happy,&rdquo;="" happy.="" he="" head.="" heat="" help="" her="" her.="" him="" home,="" homes="" honored="" hot="" house,&rdquo;="" how="" huge="" hugs="" hurt="" i="" i&rsquo;m="" in="" intentions]="" interesting="" into="" is="" it="" it&rsquo;s="" it.="" jason="" jason,="" joy="" joy,="" joyous="" just="" kevin.="" kevin:="" knew="" know="" knowing="" laces,="" lauren:="" leave="" left="" lifted="" like="" line="" lips.="" loved="" lovingly="" lowered="" made="" make="" many="" may="" me="" might="" mom,="" moral.="" mother="" mouth="" much.="" must="" my="" needed="" never="" new="" night!="" night,="" no="" non-vomiting="" not="" not,="" now="" of="" off="" on="" once,="" one="" one,="" oooooooh!="" or="" other="" our="" out="" outside="" parents="" pet,="" photo="" photo.="" photograph="" photograph.="" photograph.&rdquo;="" picked="" pit="" pleased,="" pointed="" poor="" pressed="" property="og:description" protested,="" proud="" proverb:="" pulled="" pure="" purified="" purity="" right.="" rush="" said.="" said:="" saw="" see.="" seen="" sense="" set="" shame="" shard="" shards="" sharply="" shattered.="" she="" shelter="" shoelaces="" shoelaces.="" shoes="" shouted.="" show="" showed="" siblings="" side="" side.="" sifted="" smile="" smile.="" smiled,="" smiles="" smiles&rsquo;="" smiling="" smiling!&rdquo;="" smiling,="" smiling,&rdquo;="" so="" something="" something,="" souls="" stand.="" stared="" still="" stop="" stop.="" storm!&rdquo;="" story!="" tearing="" teeth="" teeth,="" teeth.="" tell="" that="" the="" their="" them="" them.="" then="" then,="" they="" this="" three="" through="" tip="" to="" today&rsquo;s="" told="" toothy="" torn="" town,="" triangular="" truly="" turned="" twice,="" under="" underneath="" unlocked="" up="" up.="" used="" visibly="" vomiting.="" wander="" wanted="" warm="" warped="" was="" wasn&rsquo;t="" we="" well!="" were="" wet="" what="" when="" white="" who="" will="" wilted="" with="" without="" wooden="" would="" wreckage="" year,="" yes.="" you="" you&rsquo;re=""'
