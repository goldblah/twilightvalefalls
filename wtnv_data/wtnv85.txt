Episode 71 - The Registry of Middle School Crushes
b"I trip the light fantastic, and then I\noffer to help it up. And when the light fantastic is halfway up I let\ngo, and it falls again. Me and the light fantastic do not get along\nat all.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n To start us off, a follow-up on a\nrecent story:\n\n Local ne'er-do-well and five-headed\ndragon Hiram McDaniels will be brought to trial for his attempts to\nassassinate Mayor Cardinal and take over Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s city\ngovernment. This trial is already being referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial\nof the century.\xe2\x80\x9d And, indeed, could be referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial\nof all time,\xe2\x80\x9d because Night Vale has never had a trial before.\n\n Judicial matters are usually handled\ndirectly by the Secret Police, whose judgment is above question \xe2\x80\x93\neven when it\xe2\x80\x99s really bad and obviously wrong \xe2\x80\x93 or, in some extreme\ncases, handled by the City Council itself, who might relegate the\nwrongdoer to detention in the abandoned mine shaft outside of town,\nor might just eat the wrongdoer. It depends on whether the City\nCouncil has had a heavy lunch.\n\n But Hiram McDaniels is huge, and\na dragon, so the City Council and the Secret Police are both\ndeclining to get too close to him. As a result, for the first time\never, we will have a fair and open trial here in Night Vale in front\nof a jury of Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s peers.\n\n Speaking of which, Night Vale invites\nany dragons to come down to the courthouse to serve as his peers.\nFailing that, any multi-headed beings are welcome \xe2\x80\x93 although I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t immediately think of any of those except obviously deer, and\ndeer can\xe2\x80\x99t take part in juries because of their profound belief in\negalitarian anarchism.\n\n Pamela Winchell, former Night Vale\nmayor and current director of emergency press conferences, will serve\nas the prosecuting attorney, and Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head will be acting in\nhis own defense \xe2\x80\x93 as well as the defense of the other three heads\naccused. His fifth head, the violet one, who had secretly been\nworking to stop the other heads, is not charged, and is expected to\ntake the witness stand against his same-body brethren.\n\n Updates on this exciting legal story\nwill continue as we all try to figure out what \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d means\noutside of the context of the despotic control of shadowy government\nforces.\n\n And now, listeners, from matters of\nnews to matters of personal urgency. I present to you: A Heist.\n\n Here is the mission: to retrieve a\ntop-secret document.\n\n Here are the players:\n\n \n Myself, of course: Mindful speaker\n\tin the mindless night.\n\n Carlos: Scientist extraordinaire,\n\textraordinary scientist, great hair.\n\n Steve Carlsberg: Jerk. Good\n\tfather\xe2\x80\xa6maybe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him that.\n\n Abby: My sister, whom I have not\n\tspoken with in quite a while, but whom I am hoping to speak with\n\tmore.\n\n Old Woman Josie: Opera aficionado,\n\tand friends with powerful and forbidden beings who are handy with a\n\tlock pick\xe2\x80\xa6and who claim to know a thing or two about hacking.\n\n Finally, and foremost, of course,\n\tlittle Janice: My niece, and the second-most important person in my\n\tlife. She is the leader of our mission. She is the reason we are all\n\tinvolved.\n\n\n This, then, is the team. Here, then, is\nthe target:\n\n City Hall. Specifically, the Hall of\nPublic Records \xe2\x80\x93 one of the most secure and dangerous places in\nNight Vale, where all public information is kept hidden from a public\nthat might misuse it. Few have gone in and survived. No one has ever\nmanaged to remove \xe2\x80\x93 or even view \xe2\x80\x93 a single document from it.\n\n So, why are we trying? Why risk our\nlives to do what is, by all accounts, impossible?\n\n Because within that hall of records is\nthe Registry of Middle School Crushes, a ledger that documents every\nslight swoon of our young citizens\xe2\x80\x99 love-sick hearts. This registry,\nlike all municipal documents, is constantly updated via invasive\nsatellite mind-scanning. Janice wants us to retrieve the Registry of\nMiddle School Crushes and destroy it. I will not ask why. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave to ask why. We know that\na family member is in need, and we act accordingly.\n\n The plan?\nHahahahahaha\xe2\x80\xa6but that would give it away.\n\n More soon, whether\nthe powers that be like it or not.\n\n First, a word from\nour sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nsponsor is Venom Box, the subscription service that sends you a box\nof venomous creatures every month. Last month\xe2\x80\x99s theme was \xe2\x80\x9cHidden,\nBut Deadly.\xe2\x80\x9d And those who survived that will love\nthis month\xe2\x80\x99s theme: \xe2\x80\x9cFanged and Impossibly Quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Venom Box has been\nsending me samples and, boy! Have I almost died! I have almost\ndied\xe2\x80\xa6a lot!\n\n They\nare very dangerous, these boxes. Each individually curated Venom Box\nis literally a box of toxic and aggressive creatures. That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6what\nthey are. It\xe2\x80\x99s not even a secure\nbox; it\xe2\x80\x99s a hastily-constructed cardboard\nbox! Often, the creatures escape before you can open the Venom Box.\nThe only thing worse than opening a box to find venomous creatures\ninside, is opening a box that is supposed\nto have venomous creatures inside\xe2\x80\xa6and instead, finding nothing.\nThen, looking around your home, feeling [*gasp*]\nis that a tickle on your toe? You were imagining that, right?\n\n To get a free\nsample, just do nothing. Or, try to prevent it. Actively try to keep\nthe Venom Box out, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Whatever you do, you are\nsubscribed to Venom Box every month from here on out.\n\n Good luck!\n\n This has been a\nword from our sponsors.\n\n And now, traffic.\n\n A woman walks into\na bar. Presumably, she did not just appear there. Presumably she\nopened the door from the outside and entered it. Presumably she drove\nto the bar. Presumably she had obtained the car she used to drive to\nthe bar somewhere, presumably with money. Presumably she had received\nthat money somehow. She presumably had spent days, months, even years\nbefore this moment. Presumably she was born at some point, to a\nmother \xe2\x80\x93 presumably. Presumably she was a child once. There had\nbeen years spent in which she could not completely feed herself.\nThere were years in which she was smaller, and stayed all day in\nrooms where adults taught her to be similar adults to the adults they\nwere. There was a first kiss, nights spent in terror of the nights to\ncome, the first vestiges of independence, moving out, finding a job,\na decision \xe2\x80\x93 at some point \xe2\x80\x93 to go to the bar. Presumably.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCan I have a\ndrink?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the bartender.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the bartender. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the end of my shift. Ed will be out in\na moment and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nbartender left the bar. Presumably he opened the door. Presumably he\ngot into a car. Presumably he drove home, the radio on and playing\nhim through the soft-focus darkness of hot night. Presumably he had a\nbed somewhere, got into it, slept, and \xe2\x80\x93 presumably \xe2\x80\x93 dreamed.\nPresumably he grew older, day by day, and looked at each day as a\nmissed opportunity to live a life that was in no way better than the\nlife he was living, but just different. Presumably he edged toward\ndeath, fearing losing what he had, regretting ever attaining it.\nThere was a last kiss, everything was forgotten, but in pieces, and\nin the most painful order. New things were learned slowly, and in the\nleast helpful order. A basket of fruit indicating a sentiment too\nweak, communicated too late, to a person who was already gone.\nPresumably.\n\n This has been\ntraffic.\n\n Back to the main\nevent. Plans run apace for our heist from the City Hall Public\nRecords room. The obstacles are grave, and myriad.\n\n First, there was\nsimply getting past the guard at the door of City Hall. Well, the\nguard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop anyone, so as I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6getting past is\npretty simple.\n\n Then, there is\navoiding the City Council, who lurk within City Hall. A many-form\nmunicipal entity, waiting for citizens to civically devour. You will\nhave to tread carefully to avoid it.\n\n Then,\nthere are the stairs to the basement where the records are kept.\nThese are very\ndangerous. Thousands of people die falling down stairs every year,\nso\xe2\x80\xa6we will have to take care not to trip.\n\n Beyond that is the\nthick vault door, combination unknown, immune to detonation or heat.\nRumor has it that the door to the records room could survive a\nnuclear explosion. Rumor has it that it already has.\n\n Past the door,\ninformation becomes more piecemeal. Rumor becomes our only guide.\nThere is, apparently, a grid of lasers \xe2\x80\x93 carefully calibrated so as\nto look mesmerizing, and cause an intruder to stop and watch them,\nthus failing to complete her mission.\n\n There are pressure\nsensors in the floor, heat sensors in the hall, thought sensors in\nall of our brains.\n\n The\nsecurity is diabolical. But, we have devised a plan past all of it.\nWhich, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Saying the plan on the\nradio would make it tricky to successfully perform it without being\ncaught. But it\xe2\x80\x99s really\ngood. I promise.\n\n We will make sure\nJanice gets the Registry of Middle School Crushes so she can destroy\nit. We just will never be able to tell you how.\n\n And now, the answer\nto last week\xe2\x80\x99s audio \xe2\x80\x9cSpot the Differences\xe2\x80\x9d quiz. Of course, the\ntwo audio scenes we set for you were quite similar. Perhaps, even, at\nan aural glance, identical. But there were eight specific\ndifferences. Did you spot them all? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out! Here were the\ndifferences:\n\n \n The shadow of\n\tthe howling man is smiling in one scene, but missing in the other.\n\n There are\n\tshrouded figures in the grass in both scenes, and they look\n\tidentical. But in the first scene, they are watching\xe2\x80\xa6while in the\n\tsecond scene, they are listening.\n\n Only the first\n\tscene scares me.\n\n The cow has\n\tone extra spot in the first scene.\n\n The cow has\n\tall of its blood in the first scene.\n\n The howling\n\tman is howling in both scenes.\n\n We don\xe2\x80\x99t know\n\twhy he is howling.\n\n Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s\n\tbecause of his shadow?\n\n What does the\n\tsecond man have to do with anything?\n\n The child is\n\tabsent from both scenes.\n\n\n How\ndid you do? If you missed any, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. The Secret Police will be\narriving soon to take you to a reeducation camp. And after that, you\ndefinitely won\xe2\x80\x99t be messing up any more puzzles, or messing up\xc2\xa0anything\n\xe2\x80\x93 or doing anything\n\xe2\x80\x93 ever again.\n\n Oh, I\njust can\xe2\x80\x99t resist! Our brilliant plan is too\nbrilliant not to share. I mean, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even matter that much, I\nguess, because the plan is already in motion. What could the powers\nthat be possibly do?\n\n So, first, Old\nWoman Josie had her beings (who cannot legally be called angels) hack\nthe thought sensors and the mind-scanning satellites so that instead\nof playing our current thoughts, they play a loop of thoughts about\nwhich sandwich place is our favorite (obviously, the Mario\xe2\x80\x99s Very\nAuthentic Italian Ice Cream sub sandwich place at the\nmall\xe2\x80\xa6obviously).\n\n Then Abby, Steve,\nand Carlos all simply walked past the guard. Again, the guard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nstop anyone. Simple.\n\n Abby\nused a series of mirrors and clip lights in the doorway to City\nCouncil chambers to create the illusion\nof an empty hallway for the monstrous municipal members within, thus\nallowing the wonderful Carlos and the foolish\xe2\x80\xa6ly brave Steve to go\ndown the stairs, carefully, and without tripping.\n\n Those\ntwo, and those two alone, entered the basement. There, Carlos used a\nmathematical formula that he had arrived at scientifically to deduce\nthe combination of the great vault door. Once inside, of course,\nCarlos would become instantly fascinated by the laser grid,\ndetermined to understand it. Which is why it was Steve\xe2\x80\x99s\nimportant job to keep him focused and moving.\n\n They then put on\nharnesses, which Janice had spent the last several weeks making from\na home cat burglar kit she got as a prize in a box of Honey Nut\nFlakey-Os, and which she had lined with bags of frozen peas to throw\noff the heat sensors. And that is where they are now, dear listeners.\nCreeping ever closer to the Registry of Middle School Crushes, and to\na triumphant end to a triumphant plan.\n\n Nothing can\xe2\x80\xa6oh,\nno! Oh, no! Somehow it seems that the City Council has discovered the\nplan! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that could have happened! Steve and Carlos are\nstill in the basement! They\xe2\x80\x99re still in danger! Still right behind\nthe closed vault door! Where can they run? How can they hide?\n\n I will try to sort\nout what to do. And in the meantime, I must take you to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cMy\nPostcard\xe2\x80\x9d by Toys\nand Tiny Instruments]\n\n We have returned,\nlisteners, to a heist complete.\n\n This was not a\nheist of action, at all. It was not a heist of diamond-tipped drills\nor advanced electronics, no. This was a heist of words. A heist of\nfiction. It was a heist of storytelling, and it was magnificent. For\nthere was no hacking by Josie and her friends, no mirror held by\nAbby, no absurd mathematical formula devised by Carlos, and no Steve.\nThank God, no Steve.\n\n There\nwas none of that. Carlos, Old Woman Josie, Abby\xe2\x80\xa6and Steve\xe2\x80\xa6are\nsafe at home \xe2\x80\x93 having never left their beds in this warm, still\nnight. I created their action, I created their danger, with my words.\nAnd I delivered that danger to you. That was the entire plan. All of\nit. It was me, here at this microphone, telling you a story. A story\nabout a successful entrance to the well-protected vault of the Hall\nof Public Records hahaha.\n\n And, in response to\nmy story, the City Council rushed to the records hall, flung open the\nvault door, deactivated the sensors and alarms, and charged in to\ncapture Steve and Carlos \xe2\x80\x93 but those two were, of course, not there\nto be captured.\n\n The\nonly person who was\nthere, having avoided the danger of the stairs by safely taking the\nADA-compliant elevator down, and having waited, patiently, in the\nshadows for the City Council to rush by enraged, then open the door\nof the vault for her,\nwas a very clever 11 year-old in a stealth wheelchair of her own\ndesign.\n\n She\nwaited. And when they had passed, she followed quietly after them.\nAnd while they searched, roaring for intruders that weren\xe2\x80\x99t there,\nshe slipped the Registry of Middle School Crushes from its shelf,\nrolled herself back to the elevator, and was gone before the Council\nhad even an inkling\nthat they were chasing only figments of my imagination.\n\n It was, despite all\nof my misleading words, a two-person heist. An uncle (who can tell\none hell of a story), and a niece (who can come up with one hell of a\nplan).\n\n Janice took the\nregistry out into the Scrublands. And there, in an arroyo that has\nnot seen water in many years, she lit it on fire and watched the\nsmoke pass up through the evergreen leaves of the Joshua trees.\n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to\nknow why she wanted it destroyed, although perhaps I could guess. But\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t guess. I only know that she needed my help, and so I helped\nher.\n\n Before everything,\nbefore even humans, there were stories. A creature at a fire\nconjuring a world with nothing but its voice and a listener\xe2\x80\x99s\nimagination. And now, me, and thousands like me, in little booths and\nrooms and mics and screens all over the world, doing the same for a\nfamily of listeners, connected as all families are, primarily by the\nstories we tell each other.\n\n And after, after\nfire, and death, or whatever happens next, after the wiping clean or\nthe gradual decay, after the after\xe2\x80\xa6when there are only a few\ncreatures left, there will be one at a fire, telling a story to what\nfamily it has left. It was the first thing, and it will be the last.\n\n Stay tuned next for\nmore stories being told to you all of the time \xe2\x80\x93 whether you are\naware of them or not.\n\n And from whatever\nfiction it is that we happen to be living together tonight,\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: I had a dream in\nwhich cow-sized pugs existed. I was on a train, and one loped along\noutside my window. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry your\ndreams aren\xe2\x80\x99t as good."
