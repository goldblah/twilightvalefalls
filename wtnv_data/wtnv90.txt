Episode 76 - An Epilogue
b'In just a few days, the whole story\nwill be known. This is what happens after.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n The last couple weeks, as we all\nknow, have been eventful ones. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go over everything\nagain \xe2\x80\x93 we all know what happened. We are well read, well informed\npeople who have paid attention to the whole recent \xe2\x80\x9cKING CITY\xe2\x80\x9d\naffair. We know about the terrible ordeals that Diane Crayton and\nJackie Fierro endured. We know how their troubles all ended up. And\nwe know the truth about The Man in the Tan Jacket. We know all\nabout him now, because of what Diane and Jackie found out. So I won\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo over all of that.\n\n Instead, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the Barista\nDistrict, which is experiencing a severe population spike, also as a\nresult of that whole \xe2\x80\x9cKING CITY\xe2\x80\x9d thing. There are just so many\nhelpful people wandering town, asking us if we want nonfat or 2%, and\nif they can get us a blueberry scone with that. You can\xe2\x80\x99t open a hall\ncloset or tunnel under your own lawn without a barista jumping out at\nyou, asking if you want a tray for all of the coffee they\xe2\x80\x99re going to\ngive you.\n\n So much coffee.\nWhether you want it or not.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHere it\ncomes! A crushing amount of coffee. Don\xe2\x80\x99t run. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never escape.\nDo you want a tray with that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n More on this\nongoing aftermath in a moment. But first, the news.\n\n The\ngovernment released a statement Friday, disavowing knowledge of any\nevents which resulted from a recent gardening supplies sale that they\nmay or may not\nhave been involved with. A representative of the U.S. government, in\nassociation with the world government, the shadow government, the\nlizard people, and the watchers from beyond the stars, wrapped in a\nburlap cloak and speaking in a low croaking voice, said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, yeah,\nwe recently sold surplus and used materials from a variety of secret\ngovernment projects and experiments, all disguised as gardening\nsupplies. And, yes, the resulting effects on human life and on the\nvery nature of time were unfortunate, and yes, people died in ways\nthat we did not previously think were even possible in this\nparticular universe, but\xe2\x80\xa6basically, it comes down to this: America.\nLove it or leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n When asked about\nany efforts that were being made to provide aid to those who were\ndislodged from the natural laws of the universe as the result of\ndangerous experimental materials sold in Night Vale under the guise\nof simple home goods and gardening wares, the representative only\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica. Love it or leave it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 each iteration a\nlittle rounder, a little more abstracted, from human communication,\nuntil it was only a series of guttural sounds in the vague shape of\nwhat used to be words, as the representative retreated further and\nfurther into their burlap cloak until it collapsed, empty, upon the\npodium, smelling of compost and grain alcohol.\n\n All in all, a\npretty typical statement from the government, and hopefully this\nclears up that whole thing with the flamingos.\n\n Due to the\nrecent events we all have read about, the librarians have been more\nactive than usual. Witnesses, who were paid to go witness by others\nwho were afraid to get close enough to see, report that there is\nsteam and sparks flying out of the Public Library\xe2\x80\x99s many chimneys.\nHowling can be heard, both inside the building and from the mouths of\nthe witnesses as, through the windows, they glimpse the terrible\nphysical forms of the librarians.\n\n There is even a\nfew unconfirmed reports that, in the confusion of recent events, and\nthe resulting damage done to the library building, one of the\nlibrarians may have escaped.\n\n Of\ncourse, a disaster of that magnitude hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened since\xe2\x80\xa6oh, uh,\nI guess it would have been\xe2\x80\xa6last year? So, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem likely.\nTruly, it would be awful if it did, though. We lost so\nmany\npeople from so many different places the last time a librarian\nescaped.\n\n \nOne of the witnesses, James Patterson (oh \xe2\x80\x93 no relation to the\nfamous local dairy farmer James Patterson) reported that perhaps the\nlibrarians have developed the power to mentally influence those\naround them, since the closer he got to the library, the more\nstrongly he felt the urge to read books.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there any good novels coming out soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he began foolishly\nasking, blind to the dangers that books present. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, man, I could\nreally use a new novel!\xe2\x80\x9d he babbled \xe2\x80\x93 the poor thing, not even\nunderstanding the ghastly words spewing from his mouth.\n\n We\nhave no idea if this event was an aberration or if librarians have\ntruly developed the terrifying ability to make people want to\nactually read books. But all citizens would be well advised to stay\nclear of libraries, and any dangerous books they may see in\nbookstores everywhere quite soon. I mean, you should always\navoid books and libraries, but now it might be worth taking extra\nprecautionary measures, like scooping your eyes out with grapefruit\nspoons and triple-bolting your door.\n\n \nAnd now, back to today\xe2\x80\x99s epilogue.\n\n \nThe baristas are continuing to multiply. All over town, businesses\nthat were recently useful, normal things (like gas stations, and\nantiques malls, and screaming sheds) are now suddenly coffee shops,\nfull of identical baristas demonstrating their ability to illustrate,\nusing steamed milk on coffee, the exact moment of your death.\n\n \nThis crisis makes me think of the Man in the Tan Jacket, who was with\nus in so many crises through our town\xe2\x80\x99s recent history. What would he\nhave done with this situation?\n\n \nPerhaps, it would help to start at the beginning. The beginning is\nusually an awfully convenient place to start, right? But trying to\nfind a beginning means grappling with the question of time.\n\n \nScientists have a game where they try to explain time to each other\nwithout laughing. No one has ever won.\n\n \nThe Man came to us first almost three years ago, a newcomer in a Tan\nJacket. I remember him standing by the side of the road in the small\npuddle of light cast from a burning refrigerator.\n\n And\nthat is the thing \xe2\x80\x93 the remembering. When he was here, we did not\nremember him. We forgot him constantly, a Specter in a Tan Jacket.\nNow he is not\nhere, and we remember him perfectly. Years of stories and experience\ncome flooding back to us.\n\n \nWe remember him scampering over the walls of the Dog Park. We\nremember him showing us a map to a place very far from here, a place\nwe did not understand at all. We remember him passing out pieces of\npaper \xe2\x80\x93 the content of which was a mystery, the physical properties\nof which were a nuisance.\n\n \nBut here, again, I cover a story we already know, because we all so\nrecently experienced it.\n\n \nOld Woman Josie released a statement to me, in person, as part of a\nconversation we were having privately \xe2\x80\x93 without her saying it was a\nstatement. It was just a \xe2\x80\x93 a thing she said to me during a\nconversation. Anyway, here it is:\n\n She\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI always liked that Man in the Tan Jacket. Even when I was\nafraid of him and suspicious of him. Even when he showed up at my\ndoor in the middle of the night with that suitcase of his, the\nsuitcase that constantly buzzed, knocking on my door and babbling\nabout how he needed help desperately, how we had to help save his\nhome\xe2\x80\xa6even then, as I was ignoring him in his hour of need, I liked\nhim. Even when I forgot him completely, and had no idea he even\nexisted, I liked him. You know, this fruit salad Carlos made is just\ndelicious!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nI agree with Josie\xe2\x80\x99s statement. The fruit salad we were having at our\nlunch together was super\ngood, and I wolfed it down, even though I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to cut back\non my meat consumption lately.\n\n \nI got a little sidetracked there.\n\n \nTo get back to the point, we\xe2\x80\x99re all likely going to be destroyed by\nan endless stream of baristas. Which is, of course, a direct result\nof the recent events involving Jackie and Diane.\n\n \nSo\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s that.\n\n \nListeners, looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re in need of a new intern. Intern Danielle\nhas stopped coming to the office. I mean, Danielle had all these\ncrazy conspiracy theories about how radio interns are \xe2\x80\x9cdoomed,\xe2\x80\x9d\nso she wanted to stay inside and focus only on computer work. She\nsteadfastly refused any field reporting assignments.\n\n So\nI complied with her wishes, and let her run our social media accounts\n\xe2\x80\x93 which I thought would make her happy. But a few weeks ago, after\ngiving her the simple and fun\njob of taking pictures of Khoshekh, our radio station\xe2\x80\x99s live-in cat,\nfor our official station MySpace as well as to my personal Google+\nand Snapchat accounts, she just\xe2\x80\xa6stopped coming to work. I guess she\njust didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it in her anymore.\n\n But\nlisten, if you\xe2\x80\x99re more motivated to learn about a career in radio\nthan Danielle, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to have you come intern here at the station.\nAll you need to do to become a community radio intern is not\nrun away when station management surrounds you outside your home\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cThis one is next! This one is next!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nAnd now, a word from our sponsors.\n\n (Um,\npersonally? I find the content of this ad\xe2\x80\xa6distasteful,\ngiven my earlier warning, but I\xe2\x80\x99m informed by station management that\nI have to read it as written.)\n\n \nHere goes.\n\n \nMany of us like books. None of us like to admit it. We know that\nreading makes us deviants, perverts, freaks. Many of us might say \xe2\x80\x93\non the radio for instance \xe2\x80\x93 that books are dangerous and should be\navoided. Even thinking the words \xe2\x80\x9cI like books\xe2\x80\x9d to ourselves\nmakes us shudder with a secret shame.\n\n \nWe know that we should only be reading government pamphlets, and the\nprophecies on the back of cereal boxes\xe2\x80\xa6but again and again, we find\nourselves returning to the dark sickness of literary language.\n\n Who\namong us can say that they do not have, buried in a box of linens\nunder their bed, a well-read copy of Brand\nNew Ancients by Kate Tempest, or a collection of Annie Baker\xe2\x80\x99s\nVermont\nPlays?\n\n \nGiven all this, should we band together, deviant with deviant? A\ndeviance so natural that it is no deviance at all, but an ingrained\nmotion of the heart, a secret desire so common, that it is no more\nsecret than the sun? Should we begin to admit, together, that we all\nsometimes like to touch and read books?\n\n \nNo! Of course not! We should be ashamed and hide our love of books\nfrom each other, heaping scorn and hypocritical anger upon anyone who\ndares to reveal that they have the same desires we do.\n\n Harper\nPerennial. All of our literature is shipped to you in unmarked brown\npaper wrappings. Charges will appear on your credit card statement as\nDEFINITELY\n**NOT** BOOKS.\n\n \nNo one has to know you are a book reading freak.\n\n \nThis has been a message from our sponsors.\n\n Ugh.\nBooks.\n\n \nThe population of the Barista District continues to grow, doubling\nalmost every hour, through no means known to modern science, antique\nscience, or reverse science.\n\n \nCarlos is working on a solution, but in the meantime, townspeople are\noverwhelmed and scared by the coffee options suddenly available to\nthem. They are screaming. They are screaming and running away.\n\n \nLarry Leroy, out on the edge of town, told me that he can see them\nnow, the baristas, and that they are beautiful and surging.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere\nare so many hands holding so much coffee! They are all so\nhelpful!\nThis might be it,\xe2\x80\x9d Larry is saying.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything could be it,\xe2\x80\x9d he is continuing.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cAny moment could be the last one. We should always be prepared for\nthe eventuality of no more eventualities. We all live on the narrow\nprecipice, but also yeah! This barista thing is really going off,\nhuh?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\n Perhaps\nif the Man in the Tan Jacket were here, he would have some idea, some\nsolution, or even would just be there to add a comforting forgettable\npresence to this ongoing disaster. But of course, he is not\nhere, and we all know why. We all know who he really is now.\n\n \nOh. Oh! Carlos is texting me. He\xe2\x80\xa6oh. OK.\n\n \nHe says that he has a solution to this whole barista thing.\n\n \nOh, hey! That\xe2\x80\x99s quite clever!\n\n And\nit also takes care of that\xe2\x80\xa6other\nproblem. You know, the one I don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to explain to you right\nnow, because it was so frightful and all-consuming and fresh in our\nmemories?\n\n \nOK. While Carlos does his clever plan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a clever pan of my own\n\xe2\x80\x93 which is taking you to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cEndless\nDream\xe2\x80\x9d by God\nIs An Astronaut]\n\n And\nnow, here we are, in the after.\n\n \nCarlos\xe2\x80\x99 plan\xe2\x80\xa6well, we read about what it was and how it turned out.\nNo need to summarize here.\n\n What\ndo we do after such huge events have transpired? After the ones in\ndanger no longer are (meaning either that they no longer are in\ndanger, or that \xe2\x80\x93 in an existential sense \xe2\x80\x93 they just\xe2\x80\xa6no longer\nare)?\n\n Well,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ndo. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go bowling with Carlos. League Night is tonight, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten the team back together with Old Woman Josie. Of course,\nshe can use her left hand again now, now that this affair we\xe2\x80\x99ve been\ntalking about is all over, so our scores should be up.\n\n \nAnd\xe2\x80\xa6what else? The sky, of course, always that.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nstart there, and work our way down to Earth. Other cities, other\nplaces\xe2\x80\xa6this\ncity. This\nplace.\n\n \nI imagine that soon, this town will settle back into the routine of\nits existence, until a new peril arises again soon. Like a heartbeat:\na sudden, violent movement \xe2\x80\x93 and in between, a lull. In itself, a\nrhythm. A counterpart. A silence between the beats.\n\n Night\nVale in a lull: the doctors at the hospital going about their\nmysterious routines; the pawn shop (its name changed now, of course,\nafter what happened recently); the Office District, and\xe2\x80\xa6oh? It\nlooks like there is a large family of tarantulas heading there now,\nand they do not\nlook happy. I would hate to be whoever it is that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking\nfor.\n\n The\nMoonlite All-Nite Diner, where I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Steve Carlsberg is going to\nstop by on his way home for a slice of invisible pie; our mayor,\nDana, getting ready to finish her work; Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 lab, where he is also\nfinishing up his work (see you soon, Carlos!); and\xe2\x80\xa6and something\nelse.\n\n \nOver a housing tract, across town, I can see a dot in the sky,\nfloating high above one of the houses, twirling and soaring higher. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t quite see what it is\xe2\x80\xa6but it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely.\n\n In\nany case, an entire town swinging back to the normal, getting on with\nlife in the after.\nAfter all of the things that we all now know happened. All of us.\n\n Except,\nof course, one person. A person missing. A person who we all missed.\nA person impossible to remember. A person now\nimpossible to forget.\n\n \nA Man in the Tan Jacket.\n\n \nAnd what next?\n\n \nWell, I think there may be other people, other stories to tell. We\nare, each of us, a vast story waiting for someone to tell it.\n\n Stay\ntuned, in just a few days (or, depending on where you are in time,\nany day you decide to get around to it), for a four-hundred-and-one\npage factual report about the events that led to this epilogue \xe2\x80\x93\navailable\nin hardcover, eBook, or audio book from your favorite factual\nreport retailer.\n\n \nIn the meantime, from after the whole of what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet read,\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: \xe2\x80\x9cLate capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d is such a sweetly optimistic phrase.'
