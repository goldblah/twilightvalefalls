Episode 103 - Ash Beach
b'We make money the old-fashioned way. We chemically\nconvert lead into gold.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n The Night Vale Tourism Board announced that after 12\nyears of super-fond site cleanup, Ash Beach reopened today to the public. The\nTourism Board\xe2\x80\x99s new brochure shows a young happy family having a picnic lunch\nand wearing respirator masks, building ash castles and flying kites against the\nblackened sky. We\xe2\x80\x99re landlocked here in the desert with no body of water in\nsight, so back in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, the city decided to create a public beach made\nentirely out of municipally burned books that were deemed too dangerous or too\nboring to reach.\n\n Carlos and I are so excited about the reopening of the\nbeach. We are already planning a trip in the next few weeks with the family.\nAccording to the Tourism Board, there will be a refurbished boardwalk there\nwith food trucks and carnival games. Beachgoers can stroll down the pier and\nwatch the surfers lie on their boards, as we all wait for the oceans to rise\ndramatically enough that Night Vale finally has a waterfront.\n\n This Friday Night, Dark Owl Records will be hosting an\nalbum release party for Stevie Ray Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s new album called \xe2\x80\x9cBeyonc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d. Which\nis a collection of instrumental covers of Leonard Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s greatest hits.\nVaughan\xe2\x80\x99s unique approach to music has always been to askew instruments\naltogether and simply read the name of each chord aloud. Vaughan will be at the\nstore taking selfies with fans and asking everyone how he got here, and why he\ncannot hold tangible objects.\n\n Sunday at the Rec Center is the annual gun show\nsponsored by the Night Vale chapter of the NRA. All patrons receive a free\ntrucker hat that reads \xe2\x80\x9cGuns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, unless you shoot those people\nwith said gun and then they die. But other than that one specific situation,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve never known a gun to kill anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d Gun dealers from all over the United\nStates will be at the show, selling handguns and hunting rifles and telling\nfantastical stories about a mythical government that would try, even in the\nslightest, to regulate gun ownership. The first 500 ticket buyers will have\ntheir government-implanted tracking chips surgically removed for free.\n\n \nWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting reports that the grand re-opening of Ash Beach is going.. well,\noh, not well as in good I mean well as in.. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what to say next. So\nthe beach, which is completely black and not at all connected to any body of\nwater, is apparently really hot. And beachgoers are having a difficult time\ngetting the dark ash stains off their burning skin. Also, there are reports of\nhazy humanoid figures emerging from the ash. They have long thin arms, gaping\nmouths with hundreds of tiny square teeth, round glowing eyes, and they shimmer\nin and out of visibility. Some witnesses reported hearing faint clicks and\ncrunches, like someone rapidly chewing egg shells.\n\n Amber Akini and Wilson Levy are celebrating their\nfirst wedding anniversary at Ash Beach today. They clam to have seen these\nephemeral beings and moments later, experienced a flood of memories that never\nhappened to them. Wilson remembered his wedding six years ago to his high\nschool girlfriend Tanya. The memory was so clear, Tanya in her strapless white\ngown with ivory piping.. Ew. His best man Aiden accidentally dropping the ring\nand comically chasing it as it rolled into the third row. The string trio\nplaying \n\nPachelbel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHey Ya\xe2\x80\x9d as ushers escorted guests into seats and pushed\nthe safety bars down firmly over their shoulders. But Wilson claimed he never\nknew anyone named Tanya and was never married to anyone before Amber. Telling\nthis story, he had tears in his eyes. The fond memory of the wedding he never\nhad still fresh in his mind.\n\n Amber remembered a vacation resort a few miles from\nMount Kilimanjaro. She was only eight years old, she was standing outside the\nresort near her mother\xe2\x80\x99s Toyota pickup truck. Her mother was speaking in Luau\nto an elderly couple. The couple said they wanted to ride to a camp checkpoint\nat the base of the mountain. Her mother offered them a ride as she was going to\nthe same place. Amber, her mother, and the couple shared the cramped bench\nseat, as they rode toward the cloud-shrouded peak. The couple smelled like\ncoffee and brand new sleeping bags. They offered Amber some kashata and told\nher about different types of birds.\n\n Amber said that she had never been to Tanzania and\nthat her mother passed away when Amber was only three. Nor does Amber believe\nin mountains, nor does she know what kashata is, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know a single\nword of Luau, so the memory could not be real. But she could understand the\nLuau in her memory, and could taste the soft coconut crunch of the kashata.\n\n Wilson brushed Amber\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and she kissed his wrist.\nThey both cried quietly as they laid out some small shovels and buckets, rubbed\nUV protective lotion on their arms, unfolded beach chairs and elected a large\numbrella.\n\n More on this story as it develops.\n\n \nGood news, listeners. Five-headed dragon Hadassah McDaniels and her legion of\ndragon lawyers, from whatever dragon world they\xe2\x80\x99re from, have stopped crushing\nlocal businesses. And eating pets. And setting fire to public parks. The bad\nnews is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not certain what the dragons are doing right now. No one has\nseen them in over a week. It\xe2\x80\x99s like when you see a spider and then you turn\nyour head, and when you look back, that spider is gone. And that is the true\ndefinition of horror, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where that spider is, and you miss\nit so much. It was a really cute spider!\n\n The dragons were last seen visiting the Terrible Court\nof the Distant Prince. It was difficult to say for certain that it was the\nDistant Prince, because those who saw this visitation said it happened quite a\nlong way away. Witnesses reported that they definitely saw the dragons talking\nwith what looked like a young man wearing a crown, his form blurred as though\nmoving quickly, even though he was standing still. But he was partially hidden\nby harbingers, as well as court shriekers and mangled servants. The witnesses\ndid not mention seeing any hollow-eyed weepers, so it may not have been the\nDistant Prince at all. Maybe a Distant Viscount. At best, a Distant Earl. A\nDistant Countess, even?\n\n Listeners. Old Woman Josie\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Alondra wanted\nme to thank everyone for all of the good wishes and gifts to her and her dying\nmother. She asked that people please stop sending flowers though. She has\nnowhere to put them. And plus, flowers are sort of gross. \xe2\x80\x9cYou realize that\nflowers are just water and manure and seeds and dirt,\xe2\x80\x9d Alondra Ortiz said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look and smell nice but just remember what the smell is made of. Gross!\nStop it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Then she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean if you already sent flowers,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she rolled her eyes.\n\n Carlos and I visited Josie last Saturday. We brought\nher and Alondra a framed photo of Josie breaking ground at the New Old Night\nVale Opera House. For a picture that\xe2\x80\x99s only a couple years old, Josie looks so\nyoung. It\xe2\x80\x99s her smile, I think. Her smile never aged. In the photo, she\xe2\x80\x99s\nwearing a hardhat, orange construction vest, tanned jodhpurs, and five-toed\nrunning shoes. She\xe2\x80\x99s holding a shovel filled with dirt in front of a sign that\nsays \xe2\x80\x9cOpera House: coming soon!\xe2\x80\x9d She was so proud of Night Vale that day. I\nshowed the picture to Josie who was lying in her bed, eyes open. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nrespond. I wish I had visited sooner, but I was glad to have seen her again\nbefore she leaves us. Carlos patted her hand and I kissed her forehead. I said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cJosie, Carlos and I love you. As does Alondra. As do all of the angels.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nat this point, I heard the citywide \xe2\x80\x9cangels acknowledged\xe2\x80\x9d sirens go off, but I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care. There were angels all over her house! There have been for years,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of tired of pretending they\xe2\x80\x99re not there. \xe2\x80\x9cThe angels love you and\nwill take care of you, Josie,\xe2\x80\x9d I said loudly over the sound of the blaring\nsirens, and I think I saw that young smile gently touch the corners of her dry\npursed mouth.\n\n In lieu of flowers, might I recommend donations to the\nOpera House in Josie\xe2\x80\x99s name? Or any place that supports the arts. Nothing would\nmake her happier.\n\n \nWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting more updates from Ash Beach. Everyone at the beach today is\ncovered in dark ashes, their skin burning, the sun muted by a cloud of char.\nThey have all seen the waggling, hazy figures that fade in and out of sight.\nThe figures open their long mouths and point their spindly arms at people, and\nthose people in turn experience vibrant memories that never happened. Frances\nDonaldson, manager of the Antiques Mall, said she remembered winning a silver\nmedal for figure skating in the Olympic games, but she\xe2\x80\x99s never even seen ice in\nreal life. Green Market Co-opt Board president, Tristan Cortez, said when the\nfigures on the beach pointed at him, he remembered being lost in the wilderness\nwith a Golden Retriever friend of his. They were soon joined by a Himalayan\ncat. They were all homeward bound, sharing an incredible journey together. But\nthat never happened! Tristan said it was actually a Bullterrier and a Siamese\ncat, and that this new memory is false.\xc2\xa0\n\n John Peters, you know, the farmer, said he had a\nstriking memory of his brother, Jim. The memory was from only two days ago. Jim\nwas cleaning out the tractor shed with John. John said it was unusually warm\nfor late winter and they were both getting tired. It was almost noon, and John wanted\nto break for lunch but Jim said, \xe2\x80\x9cHey Johnnie, look at what I found!\xe2\x80\x9d John said\nJim held up an old football. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s from when we was kids, Johnnie!\xe2\x80\x9d Jim said of\na memory instigated by a physical object inside John\xe2\x80\x99s memory from today of\nsomething that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen earlier this week. John and Jim went out into\ntheir untilled fields of imaginary corn and tossed the ball around for nearly\nan hour. John said he wished this memory was real. His brother\xe2\x80\x99s been off\nserving in the blood space war for nearly 40 years now. \xe2\x80\x9cHe probably ain\xe2\x80\x99t even\narrived at whatever planet he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to fight yet. What with the,\ndestructive limitations on matter as it approaches the speed of light,\xe2\x80\x9d John\nsaid, sadly reminiscing about his long-lost sibling. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet they gotta be in a\nkinda frozen space sleep or something like in that documentary, \xe2\x80\x98Aliens\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded.\n\n Listeners, if you\xe2\x80\x99re at Ash Beach, try not to look at\nthe thin beings coming up from the ashes. Hide from their pointing hands, and\nabove all, do not trust the memories they fill your mind with. They are untrue,\nthey are fever dreams. They. Are. Lies.\n\n Wait, in fact I\xe2\x80\x99m just now getting word from witnesses\nthat large waves are crashing down on Ash Beach. There\xe2\x80\x99s no indication where\nthe water is coming from as Night Vale, again, is in a desert. Some beachgoers\nbegan tearing hoods off cars and using them as surf boards. Someone has spelled\nout \xe2\x80\x9cHELP LOST\xe2\x80\x9d in seaweed, but the crashing waves washed it all away. Many\npeople are being dragged out into a nonexistent sea by a dangerous undertow.\nWhere is this water coming from? Until we know for certain, stay away from ash\nbeach.\n\n More soon, but now the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cFaded\xe2\x80\x9d by P.O.S. feat Lady Midnight, doomtree.net/pos]\n\n The tide has ebbed, the beach is clear. The ashes are\ngone, washed out to.. well. Oh, not well as in I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say in\nnext, I meant well as in an old well, that appeared in the same spot it had\nstood two summers ago, draining the water into it in a direct reversal of a\nwell\xe2\x80\x99s usual role and then vanishing again, as old well\xe2\x80\x99s often do.\n\n Well. Ash Beach is neither ash nor beach anymore.\nSimply a great expanse of sand and less and dry. Those who saw the shimmering\napparitions said the memories they were given are as real as ever. They were\nnot merely daydreams, nor vivid hallucinations, they are actual events that\nnever happened.\n\n Simone Rigideau, the transient who lives in the Earth\nSciences Building of the Night Vale Community College and who recently began\nteaching courses there, much to the chagrin of the college administration, said\nshe was at Ash Beach today and she saw the figures. She saw their pointing,\nwriggling translucent appendages, she saw their numerous flat teeth in their\nlong gray mouths, she saw their bulbous white eyes, she heard the sound of\ncrunching like chewing egg shells, and she had a memory. She remembered the\ncollege campus. She remembered it was 1983. She remembered students with\nboomboxes, Trans-Am muscle cars. She remembered the news anchors that day, Tim\nand Trin, with their feathered-hair double-Windsor neckties, shoulder pads, and\ndeep maroon nail polish. She remembered the news of missiles already launched,\napologies for a miscommunication, a mistake in a training drill. Apologies not\naccepted. Missiles launched to retaliate. She remembered the news anchors Tim\nand Trin trying not to cry, trying to report the news. She remembered students\nand faculty gathered around the television, trying not to cry, trying to\nreceive the news. She remembered\xe2\x80\xa6 the world ending. Not with a bang, not with a\nwhimper, but with silence. The absence of thought and feeling. Everyone went\nmissing all at once together \xe2\x80\x93 time, body, memory\xe2\x80\xa6 gone. \n\n \xc2\xa0Simone then said she remembered something else, from\nthe new memory she received today. A woman with a deer mask had appeared on the\ntelevision screen, her face flickering through the loud static and obscuring\nthe faces of Tim and Trin. She spoke in a language unknown to Simone but\xe2\x80\xa6 she\nrecognized the name of the woman. Huntokar.\xc2\xa0\n\n [cheerfully] \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know Huntokar,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe did this, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d Simone said. \xe2\x80\x9cHuntokar is super weird,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes\nsense that she would be behind this whole \xe2\x80\x98Ash Beach\xe2\x80\x99 thing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking\nabout the beach,\xe2\x80\x9d Simone said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nis the destroyer!\xe2\x80\x9d Simone said, shaking her head. Simone said she remembered\nthe world ending, it was so clear, so vivid. But it did not end. She touched my\narm and said that we are here. How are we here? I told Simone, \xe2\x80\x9cYou always say\nthe world ended in 1983, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how this is so special for you.\xe2\x80\x9d She said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it ended. I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember it ending. Now I do. The world\nended, Cecil, I saw it on the news!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh then it must be true,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nyou being sarcastic?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I do that?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI still can\xe2\x80\x99t\ntell if you are or not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eyeing me suspiciously. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what\nshe was getting at.\n\n Whatever our truth, Night Vale, you can feel your\nbody. Hear my voice. See the sunlight through dissipating ash clouds. I do not\nknow if we are real. But we are alive. We are tangible, feeling, and whole.\n\n \nStay tuned next for the sound of something trying to dig its way out of your\nchest.\n\n Good night, Night Vale, good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: if you\xe2\x80\x99re not wearing a denim vest,\nthen this conversation is over.'
