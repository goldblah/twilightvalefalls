Episode 73 - Triptych
b"What\xe2\x80\x99s past is prologue; what\xe2\x80\x99s future\nis epilogue. This, right here, is maybe Chapter Four or Five.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s top news is the screaming\nvortex that opened up in the Night Vale Mall food court, completely\nobliterating Ice Cream on a Stick, Lucy Tropic\xe2\x80\x99s Fried Ice Cream, and\nMario\xe2\x80\x99s Very Authentic Italian Ice Cream Sub Sandwiches, while doing\nsignificant damage to American Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s Ice Cream and Falafel.\n\n American Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Teddy Rajal,\nsaid that this is the worst case of food court vortex that Night Vale\nhas seen in decades. And then he started hollering about the figures\nhe could see approaching from within the depths of the vortex, and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Static sound plays in background]\n\n Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m getting some\nweird feedback in my headphones. Um\xe2\x80\xa6just some slight technical\ndifficulties. Uhh, let me see if any of these wires are loose, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get right back to this important story.\n\n Um, oh, oh, OK. Uh, this one looks a\nlittle loose; I\xe2\x80\x99ll just wiggle it a bit\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Strong static hum, then all static\nends]\n\n Kevin: \xe2\x80\xa6started hopping up and\ndown joyously about the figures he could see approaching from within\nthe depths of\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nOh, no.\n\n Kevin:\nHello? Is there a new friend on the air with me? This is Kevin in\nDesert Bluffs.\n\n Cecil:\nWe know who you are, Kevin. And another thing, just because you have\ndecided to name the other desert world that you are living in Desert\nBluffs, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it the town of Desert Bluffs! That\xe2\x80\x99s not how\nnames work! You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just start calling me Cecil [pronounced\nSessil] and have that suddenly\nbe my name.\n\n Kevin:\nWow! You have so much passion! What a passionate individual you are!\nCecil [pronounced Sessil],\nis it?\n\n Cecil:\nCecil.\n\n Kevin:\nDelightful. But to your, um, point, while where I live is definitely\na desert, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would make it other\nthan your world, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t call this town Desert Bluffs, someone\nmuch older and smarter than me, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, did that. And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\ndid, because you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for a better home town than the Bluffs.\n\n Cecil: [Scoffs]\nWhat a stupid name! Night Vale is way better name by any measure. For\ninstance, I like it more. By any measure.\n\n Kevin:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing news. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of any place called\n\xe2\x80\x9cNight Vale.\xe2\x80\x9d I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine anyone disliking us here in Desert\nBluffs.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat do you mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of Night Vale? You and that evil\ncorporation StrexCorp tried to take over Night Vale very\nrecently.\n\n Kevin:\nStrexCorp? That faux friendly big business corporate monster? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntalk to me about them. StrexCorp is the worst!\nStrex has been buying up a few of the businesses here in Desert\nBluffs, and I am not\nhappy about it. It makes me very unhappy to be unhappy. I\xe2\x80\x99m much\nhappier being happy.\n\n No.\nStrex is against everything I believe in. Community, radio, community\nradio, government intervention in the world, world government\nintervention, secret police, and, of course, adorable cats!\n\n Cecil:\nI love\ncats!\n\n Kevin:\nWho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nlove cats? Heartless people, that\xe2\x80\x99s who. Monsters without the\ncapacity for love. Without\nthe capacity for love,\nCecil! That\xe2\x80\x99s who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love cats.\n\n Cecil:\nWow! You\xe2\x80\x99re way nicer than I remembered.\n\n Kevin:\nI want to represent my town well. We\xe2\x80\x99re decent people here. Good\npeople, sharing what we have: a watchful and oppressive government\nkeeping us safe from ourselves and others, children playing in the\nschools, working hard in paramilitary clubs, and marching with crisp,\nclean uniforms in parades.\n\n Cecil:\nWait\xe2\x80\xa6your marching band has crisp, clean uniforms? But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen true since the\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nIs it possible that somehow I am getting a radio signal from Desert\nBluffs all the way back from before the incident?\n\n Kevin:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6have no idea what any of that meant, but it sounded terrifying.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Strex?\n\n Kevin:\nOf course not! But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we won\xe2\x80\x99t let them get too powerful.\nNot here in the Bluffs.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, please stop calling it that.\n\n Kevin:\nSure. We\xe2\x80\x99re all united on keeping StrexCorp just a small local\nbusiness here in the Bluffs.\n\n Cecil:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s so strange\nto hear this version of you! Uh, I\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how this stray\nsignal ended up in this where and when, but\xe2\x80\xa6here it is! This \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d\nbefore everything that happens that makes you\xe2\x80\xa6whatever you become.\n\n Kevin:\nWow! Sounds like I have some fun stuff to look forward to once I kick\nStrexCorp out of town. You know they\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to buy the radio\nstation? Can you imagine how awful\nthat would be? They\xe2\x80\x99d probably try to take me off the air, and\nreplace me with someone else. Or, worse, try to change my personality\ncompletely. Oh! I would never\nlet that happen. I would never\xe2\x80\x93\n[static cuts Kevin off]\n\n Cecil:\nKevin. Kevin! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he can hear me anymore.\n\n Kevin:\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think who\ncan hear you anymore?\n\n Cecil:\nOh, thank the lights in the sky, Kevin. You\xe2\x80\x99re still there. I need to\nwarn you about Strex.\n\n Kevin:\nWarn me? About Strex? Why would you ever need to warn me about an\nhonest family business like Strex? Why, ever since they bought the\nradio station years ago, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned so\nmuch\nabout good business practices, and the value of hard work, and\nindividual responsibility, and smiling, and destroying the weak, and\neliminating the lazy, and smiling, and smiling, and\xe2\x80\xa6smiling.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, no! Uh, I must be getting a radio signal from the much more\nrecent past.\n\n Kevin:\n[Scoffs]\nThe warping of linear time is exactly why I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust radio, Cecil.\nEspecially community radio.\n\n Cecil:\nKevin! What did you become?\n\n Kevin:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m just a happy-go-lucky guy! It\xe2\x80\x99s like they say: \xe2\x80\x9cWork hard, play\nhard. Then work hard again, work hard more, work harder, keep working\nhard, have you been working hard enough? Work harder if you want to\nlive! And then, and\nthen,\nplay! Play very very very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nDo you remember nothing of the you\nthat was? The you\nthat believed in good, healthy things like family, and a caring\ntotalitarian government?\n\n Kevin:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6oh! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question! What do\nI remember?\n\n \nI remember being a real grumpster, just a grouch and a half about\neverything! Mister Frowny Face, I\xe2\x80\x99d call myself now, if I were\ntalking to myself then.\n\n \nBut Strex bought out my radio station, and everything changed for the\nbetter. Ha-ha! Can you believe it, I actually tried to stop them from\nbuying it! I tried very hard. I put my own body, this fragile thing,\nin between the Strex representatives and the entrance to the\nbuilding, but they forced their way past me using ethically brutal\nmethods that left me forever physically changed. What a silly old hen\nI was about all that!\n\n \nOnce Strex entered my life and showed me the power of the Smiling\nGod, why, nothing was the same for me ever again! I felt so much\nhappier. I did terrible things. I felt so much happier! I tore and\nbit and growled\xe2\x80\xa6I felt so incredibly happy! My skin rent, blood\ndrops on the ceiling, someone\xe2\x80\x99s throat hose in my hand! So\ndeliriously happy!\n\n [Sigh]\nYou know what? Thank you, Cecil, for bringing back such good memories\nto me!\n\n Cecil:\nI am so, so glad that we drove StrexCorp out of Night Vale.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true, Cecil! We only just started\nmoving into Night Vale. Why, I believe we bought your radio station\nonly a couple weeks ago?\n\n Cecil:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to me from my past. Uh, the radio\nsignal got temporally misplaced, as sometimes happens\xe2\x80\xa6obviously. In\nthe time you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking from, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t led the secret revolution\nagainst Strex yet.\n\n Kevin:\nSo you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there will be a secret revolution against\nStrex? Hang on, I\xe2\x80\x99m jotting down a few things.\n\n Cecil:\nUhh\xe2\x80\xa6um\xe2\x80\xa6n\xe2\x80\x93 nope! Uh, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right at all! Uh, I think\nStrex has nothing\nto be worried about, and should just be relaxed. And complacent.\n\n Kevin:\nCecil! Ha ha ha! Your jokes delight me! He-haha! Just in case,\nthough, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send a new supervisor over to Night Vale. Daniel\nis fresh off the line in one of our most efficient radio content\nmanufacturers. You\xe2\x80\x99ll love him. Or, not you now,\nyou then,\nI guess. Hah! Time is weird, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n\n Cecil:\nSo weird.\n\n Kevin:\nRight? Anyway, Daniel will keep a close eye, and if anything seems\nwrong, well\xe2\x80\xa6me and some StrexCorp executive or another will head\nright over to set things right.\n\n Cecil:\nWell\xe2\x80\xa6umm\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Kevin:\nOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t sound down about yourself! We all make mistakes, Cecil.\nExcept wonderfully productive StrexCorp, bursting at the seams at the\npower of our awesome Smiling God! They don\xe2\x80\x99t make mistakes. And that\nis why we\xe2\x80\x99re all grains of sand beneath their feet, the bended neck\nat their throne. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t language fun?\n\n Cecil:\nKevin? I already kicked you off my station once. I\xe2\x80\x99m not just going\nto sit back while some errant radio waves from the past somehow put\nyou right back on here. Uh, uh, maybe if I wiggle the wire this\nway\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Kevin:\nLauren! Lauren, I just heard some interesting ideas about the future\non the\xe2\x80\x93 [static\ncuts Kevin off]\n\n Cecil:\nHe seems to be gone.\n\n Well,\nI have some feelings about how that conversation went, but\xe2\x80\xa6Carlos\nalways tells me never to be down on myself about honest mistakes. Not\neven massively\ndestructive\nparadoxical mistakes. He\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6always saying that.\n\n \nI suppose, now that the technical difficulties are taken care of, I\nshould give you an update on the screaming vortex at the Night Vale\nMall. You won\xe2\x80\x99t believe what\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Someone coughs\nover errant radio waves]\n\n \nOh, no. Hello?\n\n Kevin,\nsounding frail:\nCecil! Cecil, old friend! I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\n\n Cecil:\nYou sound different. When is this radio signal coming from? Uh, when\nare you in your life?\n\n Kevin:\nI am very old. It has been many years since I last spoke to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreat to hear your voice again. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to hear any\nvoice again.\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll admit, this is a little exciting. How is the future?\n\n Kevin:\nDesolate.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, not what I expected, if I\xe2\x80\x99m honest.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, what StrexCorp and their Smiling God did to my wonderful little\ntown. What they did to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not myself anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99m a smile, and a\ntwitch of the wrist. It has been years, Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99ve drifted away from\nmyself. Sometimes I am one me, and then again I am the other. What\nthey did to the sentient heat trapped temporarily in my body.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, Kevin.\n\n Kevin:\n\xe2\x80\x9cKevin.\xe2\x80\x9d Even my name is a strange figment. My tongue has\nforgotten how to form the word. And once, I was so good with words!\n\n \nNow I am an ancient thing, withered away by what they did to me all\nthose years ago. The power of the Smiling God is an endless flow. It\nebbs, like the tides. But, like the tides, it returns.\n\n \nI think about what I could have been if I had never encountered\nStrex. I imagine an entire life without them. It makes me happy. I\npicture every detail, I try to live it in real time, but it is only a\nslight, sweet fiction, and dissolves like sugar into water.\n\n Oh,\nCecil! I wish you had known me before\xe2\x80\xa6before Strex. Before it all,\nwhen I was just a dedicated community radio host like you. I wish you\nhad\xe2\x80\x93 [static\ncuts Kevin off]\n\n Cecil:\nBut I did\nknow you, just now, Kevin! You sounded so excited about your town,\nabout your community\xe2\x80\xa6you were so happy! You were you!\n\n \nKevin? Kevin? Kevin!\n\n \nListeners, I must find this Kevin again. But first, I must take you\nto the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe\nHeroine\xe2\x80\x9d by Unwoman]\n\n Kevin:\nCecil? Cecil?\n\n Cecil:\nYes, Kevin? I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\n\n Kevin:\nOh, good, I got you back. Lost you there for a moment.\n\n \nAnyway, as I was saying, Strex wants to buy the radio station, but\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll never let them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight them off, Cecil! I\xe2\x80\x99ll defeat them!\n\n Cecil:\nAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s this\nversion of you.\n\n Kevin:\nThere is only me, Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99m the only me\nthere is! And we\xe2\x80\x99re gearing up to push Strex out. Grandma Josephine,\nmy oldest friend in town (both meanings of the word), Mayor Pablo\nMitchell, Lawrence Levine out on the Edgertown Development, we have\nall had our differences in the past, sure, and we will have our\ndifferences again. We can\xe2\x80\x99t always be happy. But we love each other.\nWe are a community.\n\n \nAnd sure, that community has a beautiful name. I mean, can you think\nof a single more beautiful name than Desert Bluffs?\n\n Cecil:\nObviously, any name. Like, literally,\nany name.\n\n Kevin:\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the beautiful, beautiful name. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the\npeople. A town is its people, and the good and the bad of them. And\nthat is what we are going to fight for. That is what we are going to\nwin\nfor.\n\n \nHey, you\xe2\x80\x99re from the future! That means you know how this turns out!\n\n Cecil:\nWell, uh, y\xe2\x80\x93 y\xe2\x80\x93 yes, I do.\n\n Kevin:\nSo? Do I win? Does everything go just as right as right could be?\n\n Cecil:\n\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes.\n\n \nYou win, Kevin. Everything goes right. You and community radio\nprevail. And you are happier than ever. Desert Bluffs is a wonderful\ntown, and you live happily in it.\n\n Kevin:\nOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s such good news! Thanks for telling me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for\nthe future to come! Though, I have no choice but to wait, I suppose.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how the future works, scientists keep insisting. Scientists\nare the worst, right?\n\n \nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you again at some point in my life.\n\n Until\nnext time, Cecil. Until next ti\xe2\x80\x93 [static\ncuts Kevin off]\n\n Cecil:\nGoodbye, Kevin. I wish\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nDoes it matter?\n\n \nListeners, I\xe2\x80\xa6what do I say here? I\xe2\x80\x93 I wish things could have gone\ndifferently, obviously. That is, obviously, what I wish. But they\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n \nWhat is the use of nostalgia for what didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen when we have to\nlive with what did? Do I wish the food court at the mall still\nexisted? Sure. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n \nOh. Right. Sorry, uh, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to update you. The whole\nfood court and everyone in it is totally gone now.\n\n \nAnyway.\n\n \nA counterpart that never was? A friend that I never had? A life that\nwas never lived. Could Night Vale and Desert Bluffs have been sister\ntowns? Was there a moment when that possibility drifted like breath\ninto frozen air until it wisped away into the cold truth of what\nhappened?\n\n \nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I heard only what you heard. I know only what you know.\nProbably, you know more than me.\n\n \nStay tuned next for a feeling in your chest that will never quite sit\nright with you again.\n\n \nAnd goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Candles lit, runes drawn upon the floor, sacrifice prepared.\nEverything is ready for the summoning. I begin the incantation. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x99\xab\nShakira Shakira! \xe2\x99\xab\xe2\x80\x9d"
