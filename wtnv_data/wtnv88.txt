Episode 74 - Civic Changes
b"Remember that you\nare a beautiful person. You\xe2\x80\x99re a weird-looking tree, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a\nbeautiful person.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\xc2\xa0\n\n Hello, listeners.\nTo start things off, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked to re-read this brief notice:\n\n The City Council\nannounces that no changes will be made to the Dog Park at the corner\nof Earl and Somerset, near the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s. They would like to remind\neveryone that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. People are not\nallowed in the Dog Park.\n\n It is possible you\nwill see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park.\n\n Do not approach\nthem. Do not approach the Dog Park.\n\n The fence is\nelectrified and highly dangerous. Try not to look at the Dog Park,\nand especially do not look for any period of time at the\nHooded Figures. The Dog Park will not harm you. The Dog Park is as it\nalways was.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cShut up about\nthe Dog Park,\xe2\x80\x9d the City Council added in handwriting to the bottom\nof the notice.\n\n This reminder of\ncity rules is apparently in response to recent complaints by Night\nVale citizens over the secretive and exclusive nature of the\nDog Park. And these complaints are apparently in response to recent\nactivity by certain\xe2\x80\xa6community radio hosts, and\xe2\x80\xa6local scientists,\nwho surreptitiously used the Dog Park to go back and forth between\nNight Vale and a desert otherworld, and then\xe2\x80\xa6announced said\nactivity to everyone over the airwaves.\n\n Apparently. I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nsure. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of anything, really. Who knows? I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look\nnow at sports.\n\n The Night Vale High\nSchool Scorpions already have their first district win of the season,\nwithout actually having played a single district game. This Friday\xe2\x80\x99s\nfootball game against fierce rival Desert Bluffs has been forfeited\nby the Vultures because of lack of funding. Desert Bluffs has been in\na steep year-long recession.\n\n I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s an\nawful city, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to feel bad. The town is facing record\nunemployment and major setbacks in city programming after the buyout\nand subsequent major restructuring last year of the only employer in\ntown, StrexCorp.\n\n DBHS has had to cut\ntheir athletic programs, as well as all music, history, trial\nmocking, and math classes.\n\n Next week, the\nNight Vale Scorpions take on the Pine Cliff Lizard Monitors, who are\ncoming off last year\xe2\x80\x99s successful 9-1 season, which was due, in large\npart, to all of their players being ghosts, and thus extremely\ndifficult to tackle. \n\n\n The Scorpions will\nneed a lot of luck, as they will be without star running back Maliq\nHerrera this season. After last year\xe2\x80\x99s scandal, in which it was\nrevealed he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t real, Herrera quit football to pursue his dreams\nof becoming a conceptual artist. His current medium is woodcarvings\non living trees. He\xe2\x80\x99s been at work in the Whispering Forest along the\neast side of Night Vale, etching phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cYou look nice\ntoday!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI have always loved you!\xe2\x80\x9d into some of the cedar\ntrunks.\n\n The Whispering\nForest usually lures humans with compliments, and then subsumes them,\nturning them into trees as well. But, since Maliq doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually\nexist, he\xe2\x80\x99s immune to such pressure.\n\n Oh! Guess what? We\nhave a new intern! She\xe2\x80\x99s been with us the past couple of weeks,\nhandling our social media. I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of an old fossil, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nreally good at things like the internet.\n\n Oh! In fact, I\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99ve long since let my license to use a computer expire!\n\n But, new intern\nDanielle has really picked up the slack, transcribing my work emails\nand my Hannibal fan poetry onto a Tumblr page. Intern Maureen used to\ndo all that but, since she left, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to lean on Danielle for all\nof her expertise. Good work, Danielle! Hahaha!\n\n Oh, speaking of\nwhich, with the current controversy at the Dog Park, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need\nyou to go down there and report on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\n\n Uh, Danielle is in\nthe producer\xe2\x80\x99s booth, shaking her head no.\n\n Danielle, you look\nhorrified! This is an easy story!\n\n Huh? Uh-huh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Oh, she's\xe2\x80\x93 she\xe2\x80\x99s\nwriting something down.\n\n OK, um, Danielle\njust held her hand up to the plexiglass. She\xe2\x80\x99s written on her palm in\nblack marker, \xe2\x80\x9cThis position regularly puts interns in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way,\nand I would like to remain at my desk, where I am safe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto die. The Dog Park is not safe. Please understand and respect my\nconcerns. Sincerely, Danielle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Danielle also has\nextremely legible handwriting and large palms.\n\n OK. OK. I\nunderstand that Danielle. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re overreacting.\nUh, the last time I sent an intern to report a story at the Dog Park,\nshe became mayor! But OK, you do your thing.\n\n Well, it sounds\nlike we\xe2\x80\x99re getting our first eyewitness reports from the Dog Park.\nUh, we have on the phone right now John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the\nfarmer? Uh, John, are you at the Dog Park right now?\n\n John Peters:\nHowdy, Cecil, I sure am!\n\n Cecil:\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening down there? Are people demonstrating? Is it\npeaceful?\n\n John:\nThat all depends on your definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful,\xe2\x80\x9d Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99m\nlooking right now at these people, they\xe2\x80\x99re all in a long row,\nstanding upright and perfectly still \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps a slight sway to\neach individual in the breeze, but otherwise perfectly planted and\nstoic. They\xe2\x80\x99re all so quiet, not a single sound \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98cept some\nincidental rustling, the mundane din of physical existence, that sort\nof thing \xe2\x80\x93 but not a word\xe2\x80\x99s being spoken.\n\n Cecil:\nThis is amazing! I am so proud of our town, taking a nonviolent\napproach towards civic change. This reminds me of the classic\nsit-ins, where protest\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n John:\nThat\xe2\x80\xa6well, like I said, Cecil, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t sittin\xe2\x80\x99, per se. They\xe2\x80\x99re\nall totally upright.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, sure, I know, I just meant\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n John:\nWell you should say what you mean. That\xe2\x80\x99s a famous quote. You know\nwho said that?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I know Lewis Carrol wrote\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n John:\nNo.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, uh, who said it, then?\n\n John:\n\xe2\x80\xa6And now there are birds soarin\xe2\x80\x99 above, lots of black birds\ncirclin\xe2\x80\x99 the rows of silent citizens. The birds are cawin\xe2\x80\x99 and\nlandin\xe2\x80\x99 on some of them. There\xe2\x80\x99s one citizen in particular who\xe2\x80\x99s\nstanding on a wood pipe, his arms spread wide, his head cocked, bent\nto the side. He\xe2\x80\x99s wearing a straw hat, and a smile of unnatural\ngeometry. His eyes are solid black, and seem to be protruding from\nhis rough face. The birds are avoiding this particular man. I think,\nperhaps, he\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of these people, as he also stands perfectly\nstill, perfectly silent.\n\n He is\nso stoic. So strong.\n\n Cecil?\n\n Cecil:\nYes, John?\n\n John:\nCecil, I\xe2\x80\x99m lookin\xe2\x80\x99 straight at the sun right now\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nOh, John, don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, that\xe2\x80\x99s bad for you!\n\n John:\nSo beautiful! It is so beautiful it hurts.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, John?\n\n John:\nOh! Here comes the cloud. That is such a relief.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, are the people at the Dog Park carrying signs of any sort? Are\nthey wearing T-shirts with slogans, uh, anything like that?\n\n John:\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re just all green and leafy, rising from the dirt. Little tufts\nof brownish hair on top. Some of the birds are peckin\xe2\x80\x99 at their faces\nnow, eatin\xe2\x80\x99 the bulbous golden flesh hidden beneath.\n\n Shoo!\nGit goin\xe2\x80\x99, you birds!\n\n Good.\nI think the birds are leavin\xe2\x80\x99. Oh! Nope, they\xe2\x80\x99re just circlin\xe2\x80\x99 back\nto some other people further away. Oh, now they\xe2\x80\x99re eatin\xe2\x80\x99 them other\nfolks\xe2\x80\x99 heads! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s brutal, Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s just brutal!\n\n Cecil:\nJohn, wait. Are you in a corn field?\n\n John:\n\xe2\x80\xa6Well\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nIt sounds an awful lot like a corn field.\n\n John:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into an argument with you about semiotics, Cecil,\nbut I know what I see.\n\n Cecil:\nThanks for the update, John.\n\n John:\nOh, you bet, Cecil! Always nice to talk to you.\n\n \nBe gone, you birds!\n\n Cecil:\nAnd now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is sponsored by Knife.\n\n Need\nto cut a thing? Use Knife! Need to poke a hole in another thing? Try\nusing Knife. Have one thing and want it to become two or more smaller\nthings? You could try Saw. Saw\nsometimes works. But other times, you need Knife.\n\n Just\nlisten to Knife in action!\n\n [Sound that is not unlike a\njackhammer]\n\n Amazing!\n\n [Sound that is not unlike a\njackhammer]\n\n Knife!\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsors.\n\n To\ndeal with the controversy surrounding the \xe2\x80\x9cno dogs or people in the\nDog Park\xe2\x80\x9d policy, Mayor Dana Cardinal (Oh! Hey, Danielle? That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe former intern I was talking about. You sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go\nwrite a Dog Park story? OK, fine\xe2\x80\xa6) has sent her Director of\nEmergency Press Conferences, Pamela Winchell, to deliver an emergency\npress conference. Here is what she had to say:\n\n Pamela Winchell:\nToday is an important day in our city\xe2\x80\x99s history. Today, citizens of\nNight Vale have spoken, and they have said something. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paying\nattention. I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear and see and understand every single\nthought or feeling everyone is\nhaving at every single moment. Someone is always trying to explain\nthings to me.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cPut\nthe car in reverse to go backwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\npoint that gun at me, Pamela!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cGreenland\nis mostly ice, whereas Iceland is actually Ireland misspelled!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Always\nsomeone over my shoulder, telling me how to do something, or someone\non my shoulder crying, or someone below my shoulder in a headlock.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s just too much for me to take in.\n\n So,\nsome of you are against the Dog Park. Or, maybe you are against the\npeople against the Dog Park. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Who can tell? Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re\nagainst dogs who are parking. Why would dogs park? Dogs can\xe2\x80\x99t drive!\n\n [Gasp]\nWait\xe2\x80\xa6did you mean dogs barking?\nAre you against the \xe2\x80\x9cdog bark?\xe2\x80\x9d Oh-ho-ho-ho-hee-hee ye-ah. I\xe2\x80\x99m\nwith you on that. There is nothing worse than an idiot dog voicing\nits idiot opinion. Keep it to yourself, King Charles! Nobody asked!\n\n Well,\nmaybe someone did. I once asked a dog, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl?\xe2\x80\x9d And\nit was silent. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Or, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say. Either\npossibility makes me sad. I\xe2\x80\x99m still sad about this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a\nmoment of silence for my sadness.\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n OK.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m still sad, though. But the sadness sits better with me.\n\n Did\nyou know it takes more muscles to frown than it does to think about\nbeing sad? It\xe2\x80\x99s true.\n\n No\nquestions! I\xe2\x80\x99m taking no questions! We\xe2\x80\x99re done here!\n\n Oh,\nbefore I forget\xe2\x80\xa6Cecil, can we move our coffee date from Tuesday to\nWednesday? I have a dental appointment Tuesday. I \xe2\x80\x93 ha! \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d\nalmost forgot why I\xe2\x80\x99d originally called. Hah. Call me back, OK?\n\n [Answering machine beeps]\n\n Cecil:\nOh. I guess that was just a voice mail from Pamela, not a press\nconference.\n\n Never\nmind.\n\n And\nnow, an update on the hole in the vacant lot out back of the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n The\ngroup of huddlers that meet at the hole and huddle have now taken up\nnestling.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\ndone huddling,\xe2\x80\x9d said a spokesperson for the group.\n\n No one\nknows who these former huddlers \xe2\x80\x93 current nestlers \xe2\x80\x93 are, nor\ntheir regularly scheduled nestling times, just that the like to\nnestle in the hole in the vacant lot out back of the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s. They\nalso like it when other people come join them. They formerly enjoyed\nhuddling, but now their new thing is nestling.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCome\nnestle with us,\xe2\x80\x9d their press release reads. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst\nthat could happen? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to find out,\xe2\x80\x9d it\nconcludes.\n\n A\nspokesperson for the group issued a new statement just now:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDo\nnot assume we like nestling, or dislike huddling. Nestling just is.\nHuddling just was.\nThis is everything,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads.\n\n So, go\nnestle.\n\n Also,\nRalph\xe2\x80\x99s is a proud sponsor of our station, so maybe get some shopping\ndone as well. Um, probably do the shopping part first.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re\ngetting word that the people at the Dog Park have begun shouting at\nthe Hooded Figures who inhabit the Dog Park. They are shouting things\nlike, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like the Dog Park policy!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, can my\ndog and I come play in the park?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice park!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Some\nof the dog owners have begun holding up spit-soaked tennis balls and\nwell-chewed Frisbees, and they are demanding that they be let into\nthe Dog Park so that they may get some exercise with their loving and\nloyal canine companions. One of them even shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dog has to\npee really badly! See?\xe2\x80\x9d and then they pointed at their dog, and the\ndog was shifting its weight nervously from leg to leg, its eyes\nanxious, and its cheeks obviously flush underneath the dark fur.\n\n In\nresponse to this heightened civil disobedience, Mayor Cardinal\nannounce that she and the City Council will hold a meeting today to\ndiscuss their various options for changing the Dog Park policy. The\nCity Council, speaking in unison, said they hated this idea, and then\nthey sent a dozen or so helicopters across the city of Night Vale,\nspraying every citizen with sedatives.\n\n Well,\nit sounds like maybe some headway will be made at the Dog Park. I\nhope it is soon, as things have gotten confrontational. I hope that\n[yawn] Oh, my gosh\n[yawn continues].\n\n I\nbetter take us, before I drift off, to the\xe2\x80\xa6weath\xe2\x80\xa6mmm\xe2\x80\xa6mm [Cecil\nsnores and exhales]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cI\nLove You Oddly\xe2\x80\x9d by Rebecca\nAngel]\n\n Good news! That\nsedative-assisted midday nap left me well rested and full of vim and\npep.\n\n Oh. More good news.\nAfter hours of meetings between the mayor and the City Council, the\nDog Park has been officially opened up to use by dogs \xe2\x80\x93 a first in\nits three years of existence. There are some rules and guidelines for\nDog Park usage, of course, as outlined just now by the City Council.\n\n First, anyone\nwishing to take their dog to the Dog Park must have a dog.\n\n Second, dog owners\nmust submit proper paperwork proving that they are blood-related to\ntheir dog.\n\n Third, after a\nmunicipal review committee approves the application, a Hooded Figure\nwill take the dog into the Dog Park and play with the dog, using\ncity-approved Frisbees, sticks, and balls.\n\n Dog owners may not\naccompany the Hooded Figures during this time, and will be safely\npacked away in Styrofoam containers for the duration of the Dog Park\nprogram.\n\n The\nCity Council added that there will be a slight\nbump in gasoline taxes to pay for this new program. Also, they will\nbe building new higher obsidian fencing around the Dog Park. They\nadded that dogs who go into the Dog Park as part of this new program\nwill not be returned to their owners.\n\n Finally,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve hired Troy Walsh Landscaping to plant new white lily gardens\naround the perimeter of the Dog Park. Troy is sure great at\neverything he does, so that should be real pretty!\n\n Well,\ngood job, Night Vale! It\xe2\x80\x99s a small step forward, but your voices were\nheard. So often we think that politics is just arguing about who\nshould pretend to be president, but real change starts here at home,\nwith your streets and neighborhoods and communities.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nproud of the great work done by our citizens today. We all came\ntogether over an issue important to the people, and we were heard by\nour leaders. How inspiring!\n\n As\nthe old saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9chorses leave hoof prints on your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with, uh, togetherness or change,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just a warning that horses are dangerous and will try to kill\nyou. Know that, and you can accomplish anything.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for a review of the popular new film, \xe2\x80\x9cUnedited CC TV\nFootage: Citgo #4172, Left Rear Cam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: The word \xe2\x80\x9cmotel\xe2\x80\x9d is an amalgam of the words \xe2\x80\x9chotel\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cmurder.\xe2\x80\x9d"
