Episode 51 - Rumbling
b"Cecil: Look! Up in the sky! It\xe2\x80\x99s a bird! It\xe2\x80\x99s a plane! It\xe2\x80\x99s a cloud! It\xe2\x80\x99s a moon! Also, some stars! There are so many things in the sky!\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n New Night Vale mayor, and former intern at this very station, Dana Cardinal announced today that she wants to open the Dog Park for public use. Said Dana \xe2\x80\x93 or, I guess I should start saying Mayor Cardinal \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cDog parks should be used for dogs and owners to exercise and play. A dog park should be a fun gathering place for citizens to meet and socialize. Not a secretive patch of municipal darkness full of conspiracy warning signs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Only moments into her announcement, the City Council entered the Press Room, walking in synchronous steps, hips together, teeth apart, blocking the view of reporters and photographers, and unplugging the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s microphone. The Council shuffled away to the Council Chambers, taking the mayor with them.\n\n\n Twenty minutes later Mayor Cardinal reemerged, wearing several large ivory rings and a long cerulean cape. She announced that dogs are not allowed in the Dog Park. People are not allowed in the Dog Park. You may see hooded figures in the Dog Park \xe2\x80\x93 but not for long, as there are now plans to reinforce the fence around the Dog Park.\n\n\n Oh, listeners! Guess who we\xe2\x80\x99ve got on the phone line now? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hint: he saved Night Vale a few weeks ago by shutting out a great terror trying to invade us from another world.\n\n\n Carlos: It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just me!\n\n\n Cecil: Also, he\xe2\x80\x99s my boyfriend. And a scientist. And I miss him.\n\n\n Carlos: I miss you, too.\n\n\n Cecil: That\xe2\x80\x99s right! My boyfriend is a hero. Please welcome to our show, Carlos the Scientist.\n\n\n Carlos: [chuckles] You\xe2\x80\x99re too much!\n\n\n Cecil: Listeners, Carlos had to stay behind in whatever strange desert Other World, which was very brave of him, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s now very far away from people that love him. Any luck getting back through to Night Vale?\n\n\n Carlos: Not yet. Oh! But, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been exploring this strange rumbling noise here. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same rumbling noise we heard when that terrible light was coming into Night Vale.\n\n\n Cecil: Are you safe? Is everything OK?\n\n\n Carlos: Actually, there it is again. When we shut the doors the rumbling and the unbearably bright light went away. This empty desert, with the mountain and the lighthouse and the large wandering army, all seemed so normal, you know? But last night the rumbling returned.\n\n\n There it is again. I need to grab my instruments.\n\n\n Cecil: I\xe2\x80\xa6I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear it!\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you back.\n\n\n Cecil: No! No! Carlos, I\xe2\x80\xa6Ugh. Every time. I never know when you\xe2\x80\x99ll call back.\n\n\n Well, speaking of the town being safe, our neighboring town, Desert Bluffs, ran a full-page ad in the Sunday Extra-Large Imagination Edition of the Night Vale Daily Journal this week that said, I imagined, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for having us, Night Vale. Best of luck in your future\xe2\x80\xbd\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if that\xe2\x80\x99s an exclamation point or a question mark there. What a weird font! It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone put paint, or some other thick liquid on the tip of a sharp finger and then hand wrote this ad. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like that.\n\n\n Then, at the bottom, it has a photo of your face, dear listener! And the same finger-painted lettering that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cBlessings from a Smiling God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Wow! Where did they get that photo of you? Although, honestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad photo\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, you look just adorable when you\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping!\n\n\n I know this farewell ad may seem like a kind gesture, but\xe2\x80\xa6good riddance to those monsters! No one is happier than me to see us run Desert Bluffs out of town.\n\n\n Meanwhile, there has been a lot of construction noise, like horns, see-saws, parrot shrieking, et cetera, from the old StrexCorp headquarters at the lip of Radon Canyon. Several tall beings with wings, who all introduce themselves as Erika, were seen hanging around outside while a Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police representative ran frantically between onlookers, putting her hand over each person\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing anything real!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Well I, for one, am excited to learn what these\xe2\x80\xa6of course, completely non-existent angels plan to do with the huge malevolent corporation they purchased.\n\n\n Oh! Also, I stopped by the office of station management. Seems like our community radio station was purchased back from StrexCorp by our original owners, whom I have never met \xe2\x80\x93 or seen \xe2\x80\x93 and who, until recently, had run this radio station for centuries. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have all these familiar faces back! Or\xe2\x80\xa6not faces, more like muffled screams and chattering echoes and pulsing orange lights surrounding dark stone doors that are never in the same place you remember them being.\n\n\n Just a quick stroll past the new old boss\xe2\x80\x99 office brought me back to the good old days, as I crumbled to the floor, struck numb and blind with flashes of hideous daydreams, a history\xe2\x80\x99s worth of deaths that were not my own. How great to be back to the way we were!\n\n\n Ahh, the good old days! The fearful, terrible, deadly, good old days!\n\n\n Oh, my phone\xe2\x80\x99s buzzing! Carlos? Hello? Carlos, are you back on the line?\n\n\n Carlos: Yes. So\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s a lighthouse here in the desert. It\xe2\x80\x99s on top of a tall mountain, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a blinking red light on the top of this lighthouse, and this blinking red light always blinks, OK? That\xe2\x80\x99s what it does. But now that the rumbling has returned\xe2\x80\xa6can\xe2\x80\x93 can you hear the rumbling from your end, Cecil?\n\n\n Cecil: No.\n\n\n Carlos: It\xe2\x80\x99s very loud! But when the rumbling happens, the blinking red light stops blinking. It just stays on.\n\n\n Cecil: What do you think that means?\n\n\n Carlos: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked with some of the army of men and women and others who roam about this desert, and they look frightened. They have never seen the blinking light stop blinking! It is what a blinking light is supposed to do, and fear is what happens when a thing that has always behaved one way does not behave that way at all. They run and hide now when they hear the rumbling and see the static red light up on the mountain. I, too, am starting to feel scared.\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos? Remember how you got into that desert in the first place. You went through a door in a house that did not seem to exist. Have you found any of those doors yet?\n\n\n Carlos: Not yet, no.\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos? Look for those doors. There must be at least one left somewhere!\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99ll start looking very soon, OK? But listen, Cecil? I\xe2\x80\x99d really like to figure out this rumbling/red light thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist. I need to discover/understand things. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I do!\n\n\n Cecil: But\xe2\x80\xa6couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you look for the door while you figure it out?\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99ll look for the door some tomorrow. For sure I will.\n\n\n Cecil: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I was going to\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Carlos: The rumbling\xe2\x80\x99s gone! Did you hear that?\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run. I need to find Doug.\n\n\n Cecil: Who\xe2\x80\x99s Doug? Wait, Carlos, who\xe2\x80\x99s Doug? Carlos?\n\n\n OK.\n\n\n Well, I guess let\xe2\x80\x99s just have a look at today\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes.\n\n\n Leo: Need a penny, take a penny. Have a penny? Take another penny! Pennies are worthless, but go ahead and take them all. Build a great fortune only to have its great copper weight crush your lifeless pauper body.\n\n\n Virgo: Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot the messenger, Virgo! It\xe2\x80\x99s noisy, and will alert others of your crime. Lure the messenger inside. Make sure no one saw him come in. Choose something quieter than a gun. Perhaps suffocation, or an accidental fall. Really plan these things out. Stop being so trigger happy, Virgo!\n\n\n Libra: Do you believe in ghosts? You don\xe2\x80\x99t? Well, won\xe2\x80\x99t you be surprised when you wake up in the middle of the night tonight! Scream loud enough so the neighbors can hear you.\n\n\n Scorpio: You are respected by your peers. You are a great thinker and leader. You\xe2\x80\xa6wait, what is this? This is definitely not the right reading for a Scorpio, it must be a typo. I bet the stars meant to say: You should hear what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying about you. Very funny things, Scorpio! They\xe2\x80\x99re saying very funny things at your expense, you jerk! Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely what the stars meant to say.\n\n\n Sagittarius: The best revenge is living well. The second-best is tasteless slow-acting poison. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a tie. Either way, you got wronged, and you need to set things right, Sagittarius!\n\n\n Capricorn: \xe2\x80\x98Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, which is better than to have never loved at all, but also somehow lost a love, thus creating a paradox. Paradoxes are bad, Capricorn. Be careful, or logic will destroy you.\n\n\n Aquarius: Your boyfriend is trapped in an alternate desert dimension. It is difficult to say when he will return. Perhaps take up drinking while crying in a quiet room.\n\n\n Wow! That\xe2\x80\x99s a very specific and\xe2\x80\xa6painful horoscope. Thanks for nothing, stars!\n\n\n Pisces: A train leaves a station traveling west at 40 miles per hour. Another train leaves a station traveling east at 60 miles per hour. These two trains left on different days, in different years, in different countries. How long until the passengers acknowledge their own impermanence?\n\n\n Aries: I think they saw you, Aries. Hold still. They cannot see you if you do not move. Shhhhhh! Don\xe2\x80\x99t move! Don\xe2\x80\x99t move! Don't\xe2\x80\x93 Nope, they saw you. So long, Aries!\n\n\n Taurus: Someone misses you a lot, Taurus. And even though you have nothing but endless time trapped out in a nightmarish desert hellscape, you have a hard time making a phone call longer than ten minutes. Maybe call a bit more than you do, Taurus!\n\n\n Yep, that\xe2\x80\x99s just some astrological advice from the stars.\n\n\n Gemini: You know those eight spiders a year you eat in your sleep? Well, they add up. They are all organizing a pretty dramatic escape. Very soon, Gemini! Very soon!\n\n\n Cancer: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ocean is vast,\xe2\x80\x9d you convince yourself, walking alone between the trees. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sky is endless,\xe2\x80\x9d you mutter repeatedly, trying to finally lull yourself to sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cMatter can neither be created nor destroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d you contemplate, despite not understanding the first part of the statement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s on the Food Network tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d you say aloud to a stranger you have known for years.\n\n\n This has been today\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes.\n\n\n Ah! He\xe2\x80\x99s calling in again! Carlos?\n\n\n Carlos: Cecil, the rumbling has started again. The mountain is moving up and down, like\xe2\x80\xa6breathing. There are creaks and groans in the earth, in the stones, that together sound like a growl, an undulating snarl of something much bigger than anything that should ever be able to snarl.\n\n\n Cecil, this is a strange place, and considering where I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived for the past couple years, that says a lot. I know Dana used to be trapped here and she has told you about it. I mean, I used to wonder how she could call and text you from this place for an entire year with no cell towers or power outlets, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for weeks and I have three bars (only 4G, but still), and 97% battery, which was the charge I had when I came through the door in the House that Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Exist.\n\n\n In a temporary peace between the rumblings, I walked with some of the desert army toward a small patch of discolored sand. We found a swath of damp dirt, just a handful of red mud, and in that mud were several tiny white bones. Looked like long legs and short wings of a creature I can\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine! I look forward to figuring out exactly what this is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to imagine it then!\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe there! Listen, I want you to find a way to\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Carlos: Cecil? Nothing and nowhere is safe. But there are things greater than us. Greater than all of this (so, you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it, but I just made a big sweeping hand gesture to indicate everything in the universe), and there are people who must learn about it all. How it all works, and why. This is what we call science!\n\n\n Cecil: Yes, I know what science is.\n\n\n Carlos: And I am a scientist.\n\n\n Cecil: OK, I understand. Ugh. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just that I miss you, and\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n [rumbling sound in the background]\n\n\n Cecil: Oh! Oh my! The building is shaking!\n\n\n Carlos: You can feel it? You can feel the rumbling? Ooh, this is exciting! Wait, this is new! The ground is moving very quickly. There is a large lump churning the sound up and down, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaning out over this ledge to get a better view of this fantastic event, and\xe2\x80\xa6.ow!\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos! What happened?\n\n\n Carlos: I got hit. What is that? Is that a rock? Oww!\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos!\n\n\n Carlos: Cecil, the rocks are coming down. They\xe2\x80\x99re coming down the side of this hill. I need to take cover, I need to find a\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos. Carlos?\n\n\n Listeners, while the earth still shakes, take shelter. This does not feel like one of our government-scheduled earthquakes, but if I were you I would still do as the earthquake safety mascot, Duncan the Brown Recluse Spider, always says: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m small, and I hide a lot, so it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to be safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And with that, I take you now to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cEcho in the Hills\xe2\x80\x9d by Carrie Elkin and Danny Schmidt]\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos, are you there? Carlos?\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\n\n\n Cecil: Are you OK?\n\n\n Carlos: I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. A scientist is always fine. Doug was really helpful!\n\n\n Cecil: Who is Doug?\n\n\n Carlos: He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the members of this great masked army. He must be a captain of some sort, given his size and the respect he appears to garner. As the rocks and boulders came down, Doug picked up a large, flat stone and held it above us. The rocks bounced off his makeshift shield.\n\n\n Unfortunately, I dropped my phone. I smashed the phone something good. I thought I lost you for a while there, Cecil. I was despairing that my one way to reach you would be lost for who knows how long. But then, you know what? Something really amazing happened! Something tremendous! The phone healed itself!\n\n\n Cecil: Oh! That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s great!\n\n\n Carlos: It is great! But phones don\xe2\x80\x99t just heal themselves. This is another scientific mystery I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get to the bottom of.\n\n\n Cecil: Where is Doug now?\n\n\n Carlos: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99s probably back at the encampment. They\xe2\x80\x99re a nomadic army. Sometimes they are here, sometimes not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have time to make new friends. They\xe2\x80\x99re nice people, but there is a lot of work for me to do here. And\xe2\x80\xa6the only person I truly care about isn\xe2\x80\x99t in this desert anyway.\n\n\n I do not know what the rumbling is. I do not know why some doors work and others do not. I do not know why my phone never loses battery power and can heal itself. I do not know how long it will take me to pursue this knowledge.\n\n\n But I do know two things.\n\n\n Cecil: What is that?\n\n\n Carlos: I love you.\n\n\n Cecil: I love you, too. What\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing?\n\n\n Carlos: You just said it.\n\n\n Cecil? I have to go. Be patient with me. We have our phones. We have our voices, and you have the best voice of them all.\n\n\n Cecil: Thanks for being on the air with me. We did almost the entire show together!\n\n\n Carlos: We can still do things together, even in absence. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back again soon.\n\n\n Cecil: Find that door, Carlos!\n\n\n Carlos: I will. But first I need to see if the red light is blinking again or not.\n\n\n Cecil: OK. Bye, Carlos.\n\n\n Listeners, I wish I could tell you where the rumbling came from, and that we are safe from it. The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Seismology Team announced that today\xe2\x80\x99s rumbling, which caused quite a bit of structural damage and knocked out power for one third of the town, did not register at all on the Richter scale, which is a thing seismologists use to assign two-dimensional numbers to complex multidimensional physical events.\n\n\n But the upshot is we are all alive for however many two-dimensional numbers we have left.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for the sound of future becoming the present \xe2\x80\x93 becoming the past \xe2\x80\x93 in no time at all.\n\n\n And as always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Everything that happens, happens for a reason. Except ostriches. What the hell, man?"
