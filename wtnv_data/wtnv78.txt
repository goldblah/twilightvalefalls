Episode 67 - [Best Of?]
b'Leonard Burton: The sun is\nactually cold! It\xe2\x80\x99s cold and empty, and all is lost.\n\n Greetings from Night Vale!\n\n While your regular host, Cecil\nPalmer, is on vacation, we continue to bring you some of the\nhighlights of his uncountable years hear at Night Vale Community\nRadio \xe2\x80\x93 from lowly eager intern filing reports from the field, to\nhis tenure behind the desk at the greatest community radio station in\nAmerica.\n\n Today I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d start with a\nvery special and rare clip, Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s first ever broadcast on our\nairwaves. Let\xe2\x80\x99s listen.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac\ncartridge being started]\n\n Cecil:\nHi, it\xe2\x80\x99s Cecil! Oh, boy! Um, oh. Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, uh, let me try that\nagain, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be way more professional.\n\n Hello,\nlisteners! Intern Cecil Palmer here, reporting live for host Leonard\nBurton. I\xe2\x80\x99m way excited!\n\n I am\nstanding in a vast stretch of desert in which no one has lived for\nhundreds of years. Neat, right? But it\xe2\x80\x99s not even the neatest,\nbecause some new folks have moved into the area recently. They look\nlike they\xe2\x80\x99re from back east a ways. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t their land, but\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re going to set up here anyway. They\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is ours\xe2\x80\x9d\nand pointing ludicrously at actual Earth, as though that were an\nownable thing.\n\n One\nof the arrivals, famous screen actor Lee Marvin, who just turned 30\ntoday \xe2\x80\x93 Oh, hey! Happy birthday, Mr. Marvin! \xe2\x80\x93 said that they\nwere immediately proceeding to found a town. A town they will call\nNight Vale. A home for themselves, complete with all the things a\nhome needs: secrets, dread, omnipresent government, and areas that\nare forbidden!\n\n He\nthen donned a soft meat crown as the other newcomers bowed to him.\n\n And\nnow, the Community Calendar.\n\n Monday\nthrough Sunday, this will be a barren stretch of desert, strewn with\nhuman debris shot out by a population explosion back east. These\nshiftless fellows will mope around and complain about the heat and\nlack of water. The shadows up on the hills will watch and watch, but\nwill come no closer. Squinting, the newcomers will see the shadows in\nthe hills and then they will squint further and further, until their\neyes are closed. And then they will hum until their minds are empty,\nand sit dreaming until their dreams are clean, and they will never\nlook at the hills again. They will cease to believe in hills at all.\nElevation will become a laughable thing. The sky, a starry stranger.\nThe ground, a barren friend. The cliff dwellings are empty now, but\ntheir scattered children are manifest, and filled with love and mirth\nand grief.\n\n This\nhas been the Community Calendar.\n\n All\nright! Uh, back to you, Leonard! Oh, um, Mr. Burton, sir. Uh, thanks\nfor giving me this opportunity.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nWhat fantastical days those were! Everything old is wonderful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\nshame anything had to change. I sure do dislike change. The sun has\nmoved in the sky and I distrust it completely.\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s\nanother story Cecil reported as station intern. This is one of my\nfavorites, a real turning point for our town, and for America and for\nthe world, but also quite unfortunately for the outer galaxy warlords\nwho wished to prolong the senseless Blood Space War.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n Cecil:\nIntern Cecil here, on the scene.\n\n All\nI see is devastation. Devastation that once was mere existence.\nPeople and buildings reduced to holes in space and time. Gaps, both\nconcrete and metaphorical. Losses that would be overwhelming if\neverything didn\xe2\x80\x99t already precede in a state of pre-loss, each thing\ndefined in its existence by the nothing that will come after:\ndevastation and ruins.\n\n Streamers\nand balloons! So a happy big three-oh to immortal screen legend Lee\nMarvin, who is celebrating his special day by opening his seventh\neye, and incinerating onlookers by the wailing hundreds with his holy\nlight. Happy birthday, Mr. Marvin!\n\n And\nnow, the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n I\nrecently took a fantastic trip to Europe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time right\nnow, but one of these days I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell all of you listeners out there\nsome of the funny stories from my European vacation. In the meantime,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re here about science, right? And from whom better to learn about\nscience than a scientist, right?\n\n Well,\non my trip I met a very smart and\xe2\x80\xa6very handsome\nscientist. His name is Guillermo Marconi. He showed me all sorts of\nthings, all sorts of\nthings. All sorts.\n\n But,\nhe also showed me a new device he\xe2\x80\x99s working on called \xe2\x80\x93 get this \xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x9cradio.\xe2\x80\x9d As unlikely as it seems, Marconi things that soon, shows\njust like this will be carried by invisible waves right to your ears.\nHe showed me the blueprints for his invention \xe2\x80\x93 full of strange\nwords like \xe2\x80\x9creceiver,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransmitter,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity\nradio,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthree commercial free hours of alternative music,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x93 that are all part of how this strange new mechanism will\nfunction.\n\n Who\nknows? Maybe one day I will see one of these \xe2\x80\x9cradios\xe2\x80\x9d for myself!\nHaha! Wow. Even the word sounds goofy.\n\n This\nhas been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk again about the good old days. Remember the 1930s? Or the\n\xe2\x80\x9csparklingly clean 30s,\xe2\x80\x9d as we once called them? When America was\nflush with cash, and people literally could not,\nwould not, stop\ndancing with their hips and wearing sequined fringe.\n\n It\nwas a great time to roll up $100 bills and fill them with shredded up\n$20 bills and smoke them like cigars, just great.\n\n I\ntruly wish for stasis.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n Cecil:\nIntern \xe2\x80\x93 [sigh]\nstill intern Cecil\nhere. Big thanks, as always, to our host Leonard Burton in the booth,\nas he has been for what seems like a really\nlong time.\n\n Ooh!\nNot saying that it is\na long time, uh, who knows what a long time is, even? Not me! But it\njust seems that way. That\xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nNew Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, 1934. And here in Night Vale, as in towns all over\nthis great country, we are celebrating with large swimming pools full\nof champagne. This is both fun and also practical, since we have way\nmore champagne than we can drink or even safely store without the\ntowering stacks of champagne crates threatening to tumble down onto\nour fragile bodies.\n\n So,\nwhat better way of honoring the season than just dumping a ton of\nthis stuff into a swimming pool and splashing around it it?\n\n Turns\nout, it\xe2\x80\x99s not great\nfor swimming in, what with the alcohol content and acidity. But, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nOK, because we have pool floats made from compacted caviar.\n\n Everyone\nis here, and everyone is having a blast. Even little Josie Ortiz,\nyoung as she is, is getting in on the act, entertaining swimmers with\nsimple magic tricks and minor prophecies. This is the best party\nNight Vale has had since last week\xe2\x80\x99s big blowout in honor of Lee\nMarvin\xe2\x80\x99s 30th birthday.\n\n As I\nlook out over the lush grassland and the verdant trees sagging with\ntropical fruit, an area that just a few years ago was flat empty\ndesert forever, I feel the warmth inside, that American warmth that\ngives me great certainty. It will be this way from now to always.\nFrom now on, peace. From now on, prosperity. From now on, champagne\nswimming pools every New Year\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n America\nis taking flight, and hard working people are its wings.\n\n Back\nto you as always, Leonard! Always. I genuinely can\xe2\x80\x99t remember a time\nyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that job!\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nOf course, just a few years later, the trees and grassland were gone,\nthe second war had hit Europe, and all of Night Vale came together to\nmake explosive and devices to launch explosives. Nothing shows the\nbeautiful perfection of human community like intercontinental\nweaponized combat. It was a better time then.\n\n This\nas also Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s first ever broadcast as a full time host of this\nshow.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n Cecil:\nCry havoc, and let slip the hounds of war. Weep havoc. Squeeze grief\nlike coal to diamonds, until it slides, crystalline and compact, down\nyour reddened cheeks, and let slip those ugly useless hounds to do\ntheir ugly useless work.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n Hello,\nlisteners. Here I am, as I thought I might never be, behind the\nstudio microphone at Night Vale Community Radio.\n\n Yes,\ntop news tonight is that our beloved Leonard Burton has retired in\norder to spend more time trying to understand what a family is. And\nso I will, from now forward, take over as the voice of our little\ncommunity. This is a proud\nday for me. And a proud day, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, for my mother, who has been\nhiding from me for decades now, but whose absence in many ways speaks\nto me more than words could.\n\n With\nthe big news out of the way, we go back to the usual day-to-day.\nThere is, of course, a war in Europe and the Pacific, and all around\nthe world. We ourselves have been attacked\xe2\x80\xa6or, not we,\nNight Vale is still fine. But people who share our same broad\ncategory, somewhere, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been attacked. And that will not stand.\n\n Night\nVale is, of course, very tricky to leave, so no one has actually\njoined the Army or anything, but we are doing our part for America by\nbuying war bonds, growing victory gardens, and chanting in blood\nstone circles.\n\n Leading\nexperts say that it is the indomitable American spirit, the fighting\nprowess of our soldiers in the field, and mostly chanting in blood\nstone circles that will win this war. Like those famous Rosie the\nRiveter posters all over town say, \xe2\x80\x9cGet chanting in blood stone\ncircles double-time, or me and the rest of the riveters will come at\nyou with rivet guns. You ever have someone come at you with a rivet\ngun? Well, bud, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. Trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Inspiring\nwords in difficult times.\n\n But\nwhen the turbulent events of the past few years have you down, just\nremember your friend Cecil, behind the mic and talking you through it\nfrom this day forward.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nHuh. Uh, while that clip was playing I found a few Fidelipac\ncartridges that look pretty old. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember pulling these for\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s Best Of show. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what the first one is. It\xe2\x80\x99s marked\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end?\xe2\x80\x9d (question mark).\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n Cecil:\nNulogorsk, our Russian sister city, is gone. The people of Nulogorsk,\nour friends, they are gone too.\n\n Since\nthen, the sky has been hot with death. So much fuel for so many\nrockets burning away at once, it makes the fall air seem a little\nwarmer, even down here. Not to mention that final sizzle at the end\nof each.\n\n Blooms\nof death all over the world, hot and final.\n\n I\nspeak to you for as long as I can from a world ending.\n\n 1983:\nour final year. I suppose as good a year as any.\n\n Josie\nOrtiz, once young, now middle aged, will never go on to be the old\nwoman she could have become.\n\n Lee\nMarvin, famed screen actor, will die having just\nturned 30, never to see another year pass.\n\n And\nI? I will go, too. Amidst a screaming of sirens that warn without\nhelping, that make a show of protecting without protecting at all. I\nwill never meet that someone.\nThat someone who could have given my life depth and meaning, who\ncould have been my other. I will only ever sit here, only have\never sat here, behind this microphone, until I am not ever, ever,\nagain.\n\n Goodnight,\nfrom a world ending, Night Va\xe2\x80\x93 By all accounts, this is looking to\nbe a good year! At least as good as 1983 has been!\n\n Josie\nOrtiz would like me to remind everyone that this Thursday, she is\nholding a benefit for the Old Opera House. It will be a lavish\nevening, with everything you would expect from a fancy night out,\nlike a salad bar. Tickets are $100 and are not for sale to the likes\nof you.\n\n In\nother news: Simone Rigadeau, professor of Earth Sciences at the Night\nVale Community College, says that her reality has split, that she is\nexperiencing another history happening now. A history in which all of\nthis ends.\n\n She\nis shutting down the Earth Sciences program in order to devote\nherself fully to understanding what has happened to her shattered\nmind, and this ended \xe2\x80\x93 but yet also not\nended \xe2\x80\x93 world.\n\n Well,\nbest of luck in your new career, Simone!\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nOh yes, those were glorious days! These days, the world seems to\nnever be ending for some and not others. The world is a worse place\nnow than it ever was before, but far better than it ever will be\nagain. The past is always better than the present, and the future is\nthe worst of all.\n\n This\nnext cartridge is marked \xe2\x80\x9cWeather.\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\xe2\x80\x99s on it.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nCan I Say That I Love You\xe2\x80\x9d by Kyle\nFleming]\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nAnd I have one last clip here, there\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of duct tape on the\nplastic casing in which someone has written a thick, shaky \xe2\x80\x9cNO!\xe2\x80\x9d\nso let\xe2\x80\x99s play that.\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing started]\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, oh listeners, I\xe2\x80\xa6I come to you with sad news. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\nthink you know the news. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I think we all saw what happened.\n\n To\nthe family and friends of former Night Vale Community Radio host\nLeonard Burton, I extend my deepest sympathies. Not that my\nsympathies will do you any good.\n\n For\nwhat Leonard experienced is something that no human, no sentient\nbeing, should ever have to experience. The blood! Those stains on the\nbroken asphalt. The skin or\xe2\x80\xa6I think that was skin? But then, all\nthose bits that were clearly not\nskin, of course, and then all the more blood of course, and then the\nwretched sound of the pulling, and the single awful snap.\n\n We\nwill all remember the sound of the snap forever.\n\n There\nis more, but I cannot. Ugh. There is more, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n And\nthe fingernails. Of course. Of course, the fingernails.\n\n I\nmourn Leonard Burton with all my heart, and my liver, and kidneys,\nwith the bones of my toes and with my belly button, I mourn him with\nmy armpit, and neck sweat, every part of me. Every facet. The\nphysical of me. I\nmourn him with these.\n\n Leonard\ngave me my start. He took a chance on me. He gave me the life I have,\nand now he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have life. It is an equation with a mis-written\nnumber. Nothing can be solved. It is an error.\n\n The\nCity Council warned that the mess left from Leonard Burton\xe2\x80\x99s death is\nlikely to draw Street Cleaners, and that we should all take shelter.\nCover your mirrors, shade your eyes, stay indoors, and mourn.\n\n Stay\nindoors, and mourn.\n\n Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath, and my barely-contained grief have been brought to you today\nby Shasta Cola.\n\n Shasta\nCola: same great taste, low, low price.\n\n *Ahem*\n\n And\nnow, moving forward as best we can to political news, of course the\nfocus now is on the big debate about president Clinton. Who is he?\nUh, what\xe2\x80\x99s a president? How did this strange news from the outside\nworld reach our little desert hamlet?\n\n For\nthat, let\xe2\x80\x99s bring in senior political analyst, Lee Marvin, who\xe2\x80\xa6oh!\nLook what day it is! This is your 30th birthday!\n\n [Sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]\n\n Leonard:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6 uhh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Listeners,\nhave you ever forgotten where you put your keys? You were certain\nthey were on the mantel but they were not? Have you ever missed an\nappointment because you were sure it was on Wednesday at noon, not\nTuesday at ten? Have you ever remembered a life you did not lead? Has\na carefully collated series of words ever made you uncertain?\nUnconfident? Or un,\njust un? Un, as an\nadjective unto itself?\n\n I\ndid not remember that story at all. I do not like that story. That is\na bad story. It was a better day earlier, back when I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard\nthat story. This present, this now\nis no good. No good at all!\n\n Stay\ntuned next for less of the best and more of the same. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a\npleasure to fill in this week, in my old job, Night Vale. Cecil will\nbe back soon.\n\n Until\nthen, this has been Leonard Burton.\n\n And\nas always, see ya, Night Vale. See ya.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all\nbusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d I say, peeling off my skin strip by strip, showing you\nwhat oozes out. Business to my core.\n\n [After about 30 seconds of post-proverb music, the sound of a Fidelipac cartridge\nbeing stopped]'
