Episode 39 - The Woman from Italy
b'Flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. The second-safest is dreaming. The third-safest is decomposing into rich earth and drifting away with the wind and rain.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Hello, listeners. Welcome to this, another day. Or, you were already in this day, and my voice is now joining you. Perhaps\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0should be welcoming\xc2\xa0me.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take this moment to update you about the misbehaving child, Tamika Flynn.\n\n\n She has been witnessed with her army of missing children, sabotaging any business owned by StrexCorp \xe2\x80\x93 which is getting to be most of them at this point.\n\n\n The White Sand Ice Cream Shop isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6there are probably others. They should\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0be proud of this.\n\n\n Tamika was last seen leading her army through the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, shouting to all witnesses that \xe2\x80\x9cWe are here! We are the beating heart! We are the breathing lungs! We are the lips that chant!\xe2\x80\x9d before erecting a blood stone circle in the produce section, in direct defiance of StrexCorp\xe2\x80\x99s recent ban on bloodstone manufacture and use.\n\n\n This was\xc2\xa0wrong\xc2\xa0of her, and it is my duty to condemn her act of extreme civic pride and heroism. Which is also wrong. Everything was incorrect, and\xc2\xa0not allowed, and should not be celebrated or reported on.\n\n\n Listen. Listening is dangerous. Talking? More so. Things aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking so good for quiet existence, either.\n\n\n In an unrelated report, yellow helicopters have continued to disappear from their place in the sky, along with the pilots who were presumably inside. The helicopters are disappearing almost as fast as our beneficent sponsors, StrexCorp, can supply them.\n\n\n StrexCorp management released a series of flares from the darkened horizon which spelled, in Morse code, \xe2\x80\x9cWe love your enthusiasm for our products, but those helicopters are for your own good and productivity. Please, stop taking them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make us ask again, or we will have to do a number of\xc2\xa0unproductive\xc2\xa0things with your human form.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Also, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing this up, there was a new woman drinking coffee at the Moonlite All-Nite Diner this morning. She smiled twice, and frowned once. And her fingers tapped out a rhythm. There was nothing unusual about the rhythm. She ordered a second coffee, she\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 IS ARRIVING TODAY NOTHING CAN STOP HER \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 FROM COMING THIS WAY SHE WILL NOT HEAR PLEADING, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 SHE CARES NOT FOR SUCCOR SHE IS THE WOMAN FROM ITALY, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BOW LOW BEFORE HER\n\n\n ALL THE CHILDREN IN TOWN \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0KNOW TO HIDE IN THEIR ROOMS THE ADULTS HAVE FORGOTTEN \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THEY\xe2\x80\x99LL RECALL ALL TOO SOON HER HANDS ARE LIKE STORM CLOUDS, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0WITH LIGHTNING-QUICK TALONS ALL BEFORE IS A MURMUR, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ALL AFTER IS SILENCE\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6and ate the last of her eggs. Nothing more to report on the woman at this time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why I reported what I just did.\n\n\n The Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency would like to address the lights and sounds seen in the Scrublands just off Route 800 yesterday.\n\n\n Many townspeople reported seeing a great craft alight on the ground, and disgorge spindly creatures of enormous size, wavering up into the darkness with limbs that\xe2\x80\x99s angle and attachment met none of the criteria of human biologic knowledge.\n\n\n The Agency would like to inform you that what you mistook for the Scrublands was actually your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house, that what you mistook for a great craft was your grandmother \xe2\x80\x93 with whom you have a tense, but ultimately loving, relationship. And what you mistook as enormous spindly creatures were the words you and your grandmother exchanged \xe2\x80\x93 pleasantries and reminiscence to avoid discussing all the hurt that lies behind you, and the ultimate ending to your shared past that is foreshadowed by her every forgetful moment. Every tremble in her hand.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such thing as aliens!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency. \xe2\x80\x9cYour grandmother is dying. And so are you. You have this in common, celebrate it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n A memo from the owner of the Ace Hardware on Fifth and Shay Street:\n\n\n They will no longer tolerate baristas lining up for day jobs in their parking lot. Every morning at dawn, dozens of baristas with newsboy caps, waxed mustaches, and knit ties tucked into buttoned sweater-vests continue to crowd the parking lot, foreheads beaded with desperation, and hoping to be picked up to operate unlicensed espresso machines. This is scaring away the legitimate Ace hardware customers, and the baristas will be required to return to their caves just on the outskirts of town, near the Sand Wastes, in the Barista District.\n\n\n Oh! Some great news to all of you out there who adopted kittens from Khoshekh, the cat floating in our station bathroom. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been several months, and the kittens have just been growing like you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe! They\xe2\x80\x99ve molted twice, and some of them are already getting their grownup kitty spine ridges!\n\n\n Which brings me to my grave warning:\n\n\n As we all know, the spine ridges of adult cats are highly poisonous. If you are coming to see a kitten that you have adopted, it is important that you check for the location and severity of the spine ridge before attempting any petting.\n\n\n Also,\xc2\xa0keep your hands away from their mouths. A few of them have developed their venom sacs. We lost two cat adopters already this months, so\xe2\x80\xa6let\xe2\x80\x99s just be careful, people.\n\n\n And, let\xe2\x80\x99s take care of these cute little kitties! Who\xe2\x80\x99s my adorable little kitten with your adorable tendril hub? It\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s you!\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure why I bring this up, but the new woman is wandering down Main Street, checking out the various knick-knack stores and antique shops and chanting dens and food wallows that have been springing up with all this new money flooded into Night Vale from one single, uncomfortably efficient source.\n\n\n She is window shopping, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found one she likes yet. Bay windows, stained glass, a car window taken from a 1983 Honda Odyssey, she bought none of them! She gnaws softly on the side of her thumb, she\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 IS WITH US THIS EVENING WE HIDE AND WE SHUDDER \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BUT THERE IS NO DECEIVING SHE EXHALES MUST AND STEAM, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 SHE POISONS THE AIR SAY YOU HAVE A FAMILY, SAY IT! \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 SHE DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T CARE\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 DELIGHTS IN YOUR PAIN SHE ASKS JUST ONE FAVOR, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BUT ASKS AGAIN AND AGAIN \xe2\x80\x9cDO YOU THINK YOU COULD, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 NO RUSH, JUST A MOMENT, GIVE IN SCREAMING TO \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 ETERNALLY BURNING TORMENT?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6sang an impromptu song to the delight of everyone who heard her.\n\n\n No one heard her.\n\n\n And now, traffic.\n\n\n Think of a number. Any number. That number is how many thousands of years old a certain rock is.\n\n\n That number is how many times someone has cried in their life.\n\n\n That number is the lucky number of an unlucky man who is yet to realize he is unlucky.\n\n\n Think of a number. No, think of\xe2\x80\xa6numbers.\n\n\n Picture all of these abstract representations of human thought, all of them forming an imagined pattern, as all patterns are imagined, and picture how those abstractions describe, in specific ways, real moments that exist.\n\n\n Picture numbers.\n\n\n There is a woman who lives at 531 Beachwood Street. Her phone number starts with a 3 and ends with a 5. She smiled 18 times yesterday. She is currently thinking of 3 things she needs to do. There are actually\xc2\xa04\xc2\xa0things she needs to do. She has forgotten 1 of them.\n\n\n She touches the doorknob 2 times before committing to its turn. She has 2 eyes. She has 2 hands. She has 2 more chances to make her life what she thinks it should be.\n\n\n But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet.\n\n\n Think of a number.\n\n\n Yes! That\xe2\x80\x99s the one! That\xe2\x80\x99s the one that describes an infinity of disparate truths about our disparate universe.\n\n\n Also, the roads are looking clear.\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n Filler text to be replaced with actual material. Replace with copy before sending to radio station.\n\n\n Talking points go here.\n\n\n \n Something about coffee\n\n\n Something about the bright start of a hypothetical day\n\n\n Something about secret boxes locked in secret soundproof rooms\n\n\n\n Maybe make it a song. Look into that.\n\n\n Then, slogan goes here.\n\n\n Starbucks.\n\n\n Copy and paste slogan again here.\n\n\n Also, just reminding the future me that comes back to rewrite this that I need to grab some milk. I think the one in the office fridge is starting to turn.\n\n\n As long as I\xe2\x80\x99m reminding myself things, I\xe2\x80\x99m a good person, worthy of love \xe2\x80\x93 both from myself and others. And writing press releases and ads like this is just the start of a great writing career.\n\n\n You have a novel in you, kid! You have a novel in you!\n\n\n This has been a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n In economic news, the White Sand Ice Cream Shop has gone out of business, and will never open again.\n\n\n The owners, Lucy and Hannah Gutierrez, have gone bankrupt and, as is usual for bankruptcy cases, have had their lives confiscated by the nearest friendly large business \xe2\x80\x93 which, in this case, was StrexCorp.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe were only too happy to help,\xe2\x80\x9d StrexCorp carved into a large slab, uncovered this morning out in the Sand Wastes, and dated to several thousand years ago by reputable scientists and experts.\n\n\n The carving continued, \xe2\x80\x9cLucy and Hannah are valuable members of this community, and now their value has been added to\xc2\xa0our\xc2\xa0value. We are even more valuable now. Everyone wins! Even if it seems like some of the\xc2\xa0everyones\xc2\xa0are gone, or absorbed, or dead. This is just part of the natural process of winning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Archaeologists were baffled when presented with the content of the carving and evidence of its age, saying that just moments ago they were working in a museum in Los Angeles, and they have no idea where they are or how they were so suddenly brought here.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go home,\xe2\x80\x9d they said to the person presenting the carving. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease! Let us go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n In a story that will interest no one, the new woman is sitting on a bench in Mission Grove Park, reading an old paperback copy of a book apparently called\xc2\xa0Bridge of Birds. Her hair flutters a bit in the breeze. She turns a page in the book, she crosses her legs as she leans back and relaxes into the story she is reading. She\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 OH END OF ALL THINGS SHE HAS SEEN THE FALL OF BABYLON, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 SHE HAS DRUNK THE BLOOD OF KINGS HER ROBES ARE SHADOW, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 HER EYES ARE DUSK HER VOICE IS AMBER, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 AND CHALK DUST AND RUST\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 HAS HONED IN ON YOUR SCENT SHE SEEKS OUT YOUR REFUGE. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 OH YES! SHE KNOWS WHERE YOU WENT! IT\xe2\x80\x99S YOUR SKIN THAT SHE WANTS, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BOUND AND BROWNED INTO LEATHER BUT FIRST, PREDECEASE, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I GIVE YOU THE WEATHER\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPenn Station\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0The Felice Brothers]\n\n\n Welcome back, listeners!\n\n\n Usually, after the weather, I am here to tell you about how we have been saved from some world-ending danger \xe2\x80\x93 that, for whatever reason, has failed again to end our world.\n\n\n But today, I have no such report, because there is no such danger. Or, there is an\xc2\xa0infinitude\xc2\xa0of such dangers. Rocks hurdling unseen from space, gamma ray bursts created by chance and utterly destroying by chance, disease, war, hunger, or the slow dissipation of it all \xe2\x80\x93 not by the sudden, but by the gradual\xc2\xa0always.\n\n\n But now is not the time for such light-hearted childish thoughts. Now is the time for me to talk.\n\n\n Umm, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. What can I talk about?\n\n\n Ah! Well, that new woman! The one I have been, for some reason, reporting on, she is leaving town. She has bought a Razor Scooter from the pawn shop, and is using it to skim her way down the shoulder of Route 800. Destination \xe2\x80\x93 and origin \xe2\x80\x93 both unknown. But we know where she is\xc2\xa0now.\n\n\n Good for us!\n\n\n Any information is impressive in such an opaque world.\n\n\n Cars honk and swerve, there are a few accidents, a man gets out of his car and looks at his bumper, fists on his hips, his mouth half opened, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell what is this now? Well what is this now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The woman does not seem to hear him \xe2\x80\x93 or anything else.\n\n\n She is skimming slowly out of town, her hand raises, it waves goodbye, her shoulders bounce slightly with the imperfections of the road. She turns to look back, and we all see her face and we..\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n WE\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 OH MERCIFUL GODDESS! HER VICTIMS ARE LEGION \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BUT THIS EVENING THEY\xe2\x80\x99RE NOT US WE GRAB GRATEFUL BREATHS \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 FROM THE NIGHT-SHADED AIR BATED BREATHS, FEARFUL BREATHS, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BUT BREATHE DEEP \xe2\x80\x93 NOTHING THERE\n\n\n THE WOMAN FROM ITALY IS GONE \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 BUT THEN, NOT FOR ALWAYS SHE WAITS BEHIND DOORS \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 AND AT THE END OF DARK HALLWAYS SHE FOLLOWS NO LOGIC, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 EXISTS SOLELY FOR SPITE BUT YOU ARE SAFE FOR NOW, DEAR LISTENER, \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 SO GOODNIGHT, NIGHT VALE.\n\n\n GOODNIGHT.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Your Bitcoin address is your middle name, followed by the name of your first pet, and the first street you lived on.'
