Episode 85 - The April Monologues
b"Cecil:\nOnce again, the turning of the seasons. Nearly imperceptible\nhere, a shading of the desert heat. But we feel the change in the\nthrum of our bodies, in the texture of the sand.\n\n There is rain, once in a while. If\nnot here, then somewhere else, surely.\n\n Wild spring has stepped in for her\nstolid winter sister. It is April, and something is different. It is\nApril, and the days have depth and vibrance.\n\n It is April.\n\n And so, dear listeners, Night Vale\nCommunity Radio is pleased to present The April Monologues.\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nChad. Oh, Chad. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to understand and\xe2\x80\xa6I wish I did not.\n\n You\nused to wear nice shirts. You cut your hair regularly. Sometimes,\nwhile you slept, I would come in to keep it orderly and presentable\nfor the next morning. You would shower, and shave, and dress for your\ninternship. So plain and well kempt and precious, unaware of the\nFaceless Old Woman Secretly Living In Your Home.\n\n And\nthen, one day, you did not return home.\n\n You\nlove your home. You rarely leave, not even to be with other people.\nYou play video games, and watched police dramas, and read books by\ncomedians. You\xe2\x80\x99ve always loved your solitude, and I have always\nthought you were special in how completely ordinary\nyou seemed. Few young men are exactly what one thinks of when one\nthinks of a young man.\n\n You\nwere it, Chad. And I always looked out for you.\n\n Remember\nthat terrible roach problem you had? You tried all kinds of traps and\npoisons, but nothing worked? Only one day you returned home to find\nthousands of roach corpses scattered across your floor, each one with\nits legs tied and its head removed, and there was a hand-scrawled\nnote that said \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll not bother you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n That\nwas me. I did that.\n\n Well,\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill the roaches, that was the exterminator you called. He\nwas, very thorough at\nhis job. But I wrote\nthe note, Chad. That note was me.\n\n We\nhad a good way about us. I lived secretly and facelessly in your\nhome, and you\xe2\x80\xa6well, you kind of did, too. Only, metaphorically.\n\n But\nthen one night you didn\xe2\x80\x99t return home.\n\n I\nsaw in your emails (I loved reading your emails, Chad, so\ncompellingly bland) you had to go check out a used and discount\nsporting goods store. Something for your work. But that store was not\nwhat it claimed to be, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t return home for months. The\nlandlord came by in your long absence, but I scared her off with this\nterrifying noise I can make using only a leather belt and a bird.\n\n You\nleft your home, and I protected it for you.\n\n But\nwhen you returned, things were different. Oh, how different! Your\ncrisp button shirts all unbuttoned and wrinkled, dangling on hooks\nlike dried pelts from a misguided hunt.\n\n These\ndays you rarely notice the little things I do. Like when I painted\nthe inside of your bathtub black, or glued blurry photos of spiders\ninto the bottom of your mugs. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even play video games\nanymore. You wear hoods and light candles. You drew a star in the\nmiddle of your floor, which\xe2\x80\xa6actually, I can totally get behind.\n\n Your\nemails, which were once so wonderfully calm and full of mailing\nlists, and then social invitations, and social invitation rejections,\nand food delivery receipts, the tale of a stagnant nothing of a man,\nso perfectly lovable in his comfy inertia\xe2\x80\xa6now they are terse, coded\nmessages to a girl I think you are destroying.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFound\na door. Come over,\xe2\x80\x9d this one says.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nis here, and he is good,\xe2\x80\x9d this one says.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCandles\nare growing again,\xe2\x80\x9d this one says.\n\n I do\nnot like these candles you have that grow when lit, and melt when\nnot. And I certainly do not like him.\n\n What\nyou brought to us here in this little town, my\ntown, the town I secretly live in, what you summoned\xe2\x80\xa6I stopped\nsecretly living in your house because I was afraid of it. But now I\nhave returned because I feel \xe2\x80\x93 unusual for me \xe2\x80\x93 some obligation\nto do something, to prevent this coming disaster.\n\n Listen\nto me. It is five in the morning and you are asleep, but I am at your\near quietly asking you \xe2\x80\x93 telling you \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m begging you really,\nChad. Did you ever think that I would beg\nyou? Beg anyone? I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t begged since I was a child aboard that wicked ship. Those men\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t listen either, Chad, which is the reason I lived at the bottom\nof the ocean for so many years before this place, this desert, this\ntown, this apartment\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Chad,\nwhat happened to you in that store that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a store? What did they\nturn you into? What have you brought into this reality? Do you even\nknow the destruction that awaits this town? Not just this town,\nperhaps the world? That is not a door you have opened, Chad.\n\n When\nis a door not a door?\n\n When\nit is a chasm.\n\n I\nknow you cannot see or hear me, for I live secretly, but I beg you.\nIf somehow my voice seeps into your dreams and sticks in your memory,\nyou must undo what you have done, before it is too late. You must\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Chad?\nThat creature, that monster you summoned is here. It is staring at me\nwith eyes that could never be mistaken for human. It\xe2\x80\x99s walking toward\nme. How does it see\nme, Chad? No one sees me!\n\n Chad?!?\nIt is licking my hand! Stop it! It\xe2\x80\x99s bringing me a tennis ball! The\npuppy is bringing me a ball!\nI will not play fetch with you, hound!\n\n How\ndo you see me, you monster?\n\n Chad?\nWe must undo\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n GET\nAWAY FROM ME!\n\n You\nmust undo what you have done. It means nothing but ill will to this\ntown, to this world, and most importantly, from my perspective, to a\nFaceless Old Woman That Secretly Lives In Your Home.\n\n Stop\nstaring at me, you unholy beast! There, beagle, go fetch your stupid\nball!\n\n [Static,\nwith Disparition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSong\nfor the Other Side\xe2\x80\x9d playing faintly]\n\n Cecil:\nGrowth turns our thoughts to decline. Each new sprout brings to mind\nthe decay out of which it grows. Each thing leads to its opposite.\nEvery moment contains multitudes. Every second is the history of the\nuniverse, if taken at its composite parts.\n\n Let\nus take this moment at its composite parts. Break down this day into\neach person\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. We return you now to The April Monologues.\n\n Michelle\nNguyen:\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking lately about loneliness. Not because I\xe2\x80\x99m lonely, I\njust like to be ahead of the curve when it comes to thinking about\nthings. Ugh, obviously I\xe2\x80\x99m not lonely. I\xe2\x80\x99m Michelle Nguyen, owner of\nthe coolest (and only) record store in town, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nlonely! I\xe2\x80\x99m just, like, a performance artist, and my medium is\nsolitude.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen listening to a lot of hopcore lately. It\xe2\x80\x99s my new favorite\ngenre. It\xe2\x80\x99s recordings of a person hopping.\n\n *Thump*\n*Thump* *Thump*\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6but\nsoft.\n\n *thump*\n \xc2\xa0*thump* \xc2\xa0 *thump*\n\n Totally\ngreat. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have heard of it. Because I made it myself, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve shared it with no one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a recording of me hopping. I\nrecorded that and I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the new thing.\n\n Maureen\ncame by. Nervous, jaw clenched, hair parted, hands fluttering,\nstopping, restarting, sighing Maureen. She was looking for something\nnew to listen to, said things were stressful at her internship. She\nhad to led an army, or whatever? And she needed something that would\nrelax her.\n\n I\nsuggested easy listening, like Slayer or some silence, but she said\nshe was tired of all the top 40 stations playing no sound at all.\nSilence is too mainstream, and she wanted something new.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe honest, I actually like silence. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s, like, so\npopular, but my favorite silence is the hum of a dryer from the next\nfloor down. I also like the swish of a highway that you thought was\ntoo far away to hear, but now that it\xe2\x80\x99s so quiet you can hear it,\ndistant and dissipating. Like, the sizzle of foam on a wave.\n\n I\ngave Maureen Leonard Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s new album, the one where he talks in a\ngravely voice and women sing along behind him. She rolled her eyes\nand walked out. I think she liked it.\n\n Hold\non.\n\n Welcome\nto Dark Owl Records. Hey, Larry. Oh you want the new album by the\nBeatles? How original. Well, all the dubstep stuff is upstairs.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike that old joke: I listen to Bach often but never the Beatles.\n\n *thump*\n \xc2\xa0*thump* \xc2\xa0 *thump*\n\n I\nlove\nthis hopcore recording! I made it on the old beige carpet of the back\noffice here at the store. I did it in socks so it would be extra\nquiet. You have to hold still, like, even hold your breath to hear\nit. But it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\n\n *thump*\n \xc2\xa0*thump*\n\n You\nhave to really pay attention to notice me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m there.\n\n I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t actually listen to Bach often. What a sellout! Did you see his\nHBO special? Ugh! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but I bet it was bad.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\na quiet time for record sales. Usually it\xe2\x80\x99s really busy, which is\nannoying. I hate it when people who are, like, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I want to\npay you a lot of money for physical albums!\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s like, get in\nline, you know? Get in that line. The one leading to the cash\nregister. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring you up when it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn.\n\n But\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve let the temporary staff dissolve back into mud for the season,\nand I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to mutter the incantations to bring them back to\nlife for another month or two. It\xe2\x80\x99s just me, behind the counter. Me,\nlike always.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nall I need. I\xe2\x80\x99m the ultimate underground hit. No one\xe2\x80\x99s heard of me.\nNo one\xe2\x80\x99s listening. Just the way I like it.\n\n Yes,\nI know this is a one story building, Larry! I was being metaphorical.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have any Beatles albums. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the old joke: I\nlisten to Bach often, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n He\nleft. His loss.\n\n Maureen\ncame by. Steady, jaw tight, hair loose, hands swinging, shuffling,\nrestarting, sighing Maureen. She said she liked Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s album, but\nshe had heard it enough now. What else did I have?\n\n I\nnever thought I\xe2\x80\x99d do this, but I gave her some of my favorite\nrecordings of bees. I love\nthose recordings! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to them enough times now that I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ever need to hear them again. It\xe2\x80\x99s like, the sound became part\nof me, and I know it better than the recordings do, you know?\n\n Hmm,\nmaybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Probably not. You\xe2\x80\x99re probably still listening\nto that Woody Guthrie single on repeat, because you just listen to\nwhatever \xe2\x80\x9cbig music\xe2\x80\x9d tells you too.\n\n Oh,\nthis is my favorite part of the hopcore recording. It\xe2\x80\x99s the part\nwhere the thump of my hopping gets so quiet that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any sound\nat all. It\xe2\x80\x99s a silence. And you have to know I\xe2\x80\x99m there to recognize\nme in the silence. That I\xe2\x80\x99m still hopping, even though you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear\nit. Listen:\n\n [Silence\nexcept for Disparition\xe2\x80\x99s background music and, presumably, Michelle\nNguyen hopping silently]\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s\nme in there, in that no sound at all. They say music is made up of\nthe spaces between the notes, and that life is made up of the moments\nwhen your eyes are close because you\xe2\x80\x99re blinking. And that books are\nmade up of blank pages that everyone pretends have words on them so\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll seem smart.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nthe blank. And the space. I\xe2\x80\x99m the pause. I\xe2\x80\x99m the gap.\n\n Hold\non, I have a customer.\n\n I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t actually have a customer; I just need a moment to myself. This\nis me, greeting someone. This is them, feeling like just because\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re in a record shop they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to, like, music, or\nwhatever.\n\n Ugh,\nthat person is the worst! Hold on, someone is actually coming in.\n\n Oh!\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6I'll\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\n\n Maureen\ncame by. Satisfied, jaw loose, hair up, hands idling, striding,\nstopping, restarting, sighing Maureen. She said she loved the bees\nrecording. She wanted something like it, but even more so. Similar,\nbut so different that it would startle her.\n\n I\nknew exactly what she meant with that thirst, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\nto satisfy it. There\xe2\x80\x99s only so much music, you know? And there\xe2\x80\x99s so\nmuch human desire.\n\n Well,\nyou are not going to believe this. Probably, like, you won\xe2\x80\x99t even\nunderstand. I gave her the recording of me hopping. I know that,\nlike, ruins it because now someone else has listened to it, but\nsomehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if Maureen hears it. I think, maybe even I like\nthat. I hope she comes back soon.\n\n I\nmean, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. I love\nit when the record store is empty, when there are none of those\nannoying customers clamoring for music to listen to. Being alone is\nthe best.\n\n But\nI also kind of like it when Maureen comes by. Her being here is cool\ntoo, I guess.\n\n I\njust have to figure out what album to show her next. Only, there\xe2\x80\x99s so\nmuch good music, you know?\n\n [Static,\nwith Disparition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBook\nof Arrows\xe2\x80\x9d playing faintly]\n\n Cecil:\nEach leads to the next. The seasons are a corridor we perceive\nthrough, and the door at the end of the corridor is black and\ndepthless. Appreciate the warmth of this narrow corridor.\n\n How\nsmall this world is! And how small we all are for living in it. And\nhow joyful a smallness can be.\n\n So\nlet us return, for one last time, for one last small time, to The\nApril Monologues.\n\n Steve\nCarlsberg:\nI try to be helpful. I know I can\xe2\x80\x99t always fix everything, I know my\nlimits (and they are many), but still\xe2\x80\xa6I try to be helpful.\n\n So\nwhen the kid came by, I did my best.\n\n He\nwas scared, sure, because he could see them too. The glowing arrows\nin the sky. Dotted lines and arrows and circles\xe2\x80\xa6see, the sky is a\nchart that explains the entire world, and he could see it! That\xe2\x80\x99s a\nterrifying thing if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for it.\n\n Oh,\nhe was shaking so bad. His ball cap was pulled low over his face.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSteve!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cSteve Carlsberg! I know you can see them too. Help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nI tried. I\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x93 I tried to be helpful.\n\n I\nlike the evenings, when it\xe2\x80\x99s quiet. In parts of the world, the big\ncities, things don\xe2\x80\x99t change much from morning to afternoon to\nevening. The same even light, the same people in a hurry. But here,\nevery time of day has a different tone and shade.\n\n In\nthe mornings, before anyone else is up, the desert is golden, and the\nhorizon light illuminates every detail on the mountains to the west.\n\n I\nfeel bad for the folks who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in mountains, who won\xe2\x80\x99t see,\neven when shown.\n\n Then\nthe birds come and hop around outside the kitchen window. Oh, I like\nto watch them as I make coffee. My brother-in-law, he never sees the\nbirds on account of he likes to grind the coffee himself, and the\npounding of his coffee hammer keeps all the birds away. But me? I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind the pre-hammered stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s a soft trade for the birds.\n\n And\nthen the afternoon, when the light deepens and widens, and the\nmountains turn to blue cutouts against a white-blue sky!\n\n And\nthen the sunset, loud and fragrant, like sunsets usually are.\n\n And\nthen the evening, a vast, quiet empty. Just me and Abbey and Janice,\nfloating, and island of a family in the rich darkness of the desert\nnothing.\n\n The\nkid was so\nscared! Oh, boy. But he had it in him. He tries to be helpful too, I\ncan tell! And so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to know. He wanted to do something\nabout it.\n\n He\nsaid that he\xe2\x80\x99d been sent to a sporting goods store that they thought\nmight have been a front for the World Government. I know that place.\nThe World Government isn\xe2\x80\x99t the half of it! Go in that sporting goods\nstore, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna find a real\nracket!\n\n Ha-ha-ha-ha!\nI love puns!\n\n But\nyeah, that place holds the core of it. And this kid, he goes in there\nand he sees\nit! And once you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, once you know, you can\xe2\x80\x99t ever not know.\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t become who you once were after you\xe2\x80\x99ve become what you are\nnow.\n\n Glowing\narrows in the sky, dotted lines. He understood, like I understand.\n\n The\nfolks that run Night Vale, they think they have control. But you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t control what a person knows! The more you think you have that\ncontained, the more it eludes you. You might as well try to control\nthe weather.\n\n [Brief\ndiscordant music]\n\n And\nthey try to do that, too, using cloud seeding, drones, and laser\narrays. But it never works out the way they planned.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ncan we do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d the boy kept asking. Poor kid.\n\n I\nwish my brother-in-law took better care of his interns at the radio\nstation. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t send them to places they had no right being, like\nsporting good stores run by the World Government. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not up to\nme. I suppose Cecil can run his life the way he wants, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t\never hear from me about it. Not like the other way around, I suppose.\n\n The\nkid understood how the world worked. He could see the structure of it\nand, oh, bless him, he wanted to fix it! To make it right again. And\nhe wanted me to tell him how.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNot\nmuch we can do but understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much to do but\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n But\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept it. He wanted to follow those glowing arrows in\nthe sky like they were a map to somewhere, and not a labyrinth in\nwhich a monster lives.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said. \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\nChad,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, in time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel better. Hey, maybe\nget a puppy!\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a puppy infestation a few years\nback, hell on the insulation and some load-bearing joists, but it was\njust the cutest\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cSummon a puppy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cSure, or just get\na puppy. Like, \xe2\x80\x98adopt\xe2\x80\x99 is probably the word you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for,\xe2\x80\x9d I\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAdopt a puppy, sure. They smile, and wag their tails, and\nroll around, very cute!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis how we will change things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSummon a puppy. The\nWorld Government will never see it coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nhe thanked me and walked away.\n\n Oh,\nwell. At least he\xe2\x80\x99s not a station intern anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nfine. What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst that could happen? Ha-ha.\n\n I\nsat out on the porch the rest of the day, just thinking, watching the\nwide light of afternoon narrow back down to the west, until I could\nsmell the sunset coming. And then I went inside. It was Abby\xe2\x80\x99s turn\nto make dinner, and it looked delicious! Oh-ho!\n\n Maybe\nI should get a puppy, too. Add one more to our island of a family. A\npuppy could be just the thing. Janice would love it!\n\n But\nnot\na puppy like that kid has now. I think, perhaps, that that\xe2\x80\x99s no puppy\nat all. Maybe it was a mistake, my conversation with him. But what\ncan I say? I try to be helpful.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd so we reach the end of The April Monologues. There is much that\ncould be said. I will say none of it.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Put your [static] in, take your [static] out. Put your\n[static] in and [static] all about."
