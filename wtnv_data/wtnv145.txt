123 - A Story of Love and Horror, part 3: “Frances”
b'Who was that whistling, whistling in the dark? Was that you, my love, whistling, whistling in the dark? Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n Frances Donaldson and Nazr al-Mujaheed were faced with a terrible choice. There are times, as humans, it feels like we are given more responsibility than we can handle. It feels as though the world is resting on our backs. And any decision we make could have implications for everyone else in the entire world. But of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s not really the case. The truth is, while we might be able to ruin our own lives, or even a whole bunch of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, there are few who are ever put in the position where they can make even a ripple in the life of everyone on Earth.\n\n But this was exactly the situation Frances and Nazr found themselves in. She had accidentally entered this Night Vale from a Night Vale in a different universe. If Nazr and Frances stayed together, the two of them could both phase out of reality and cease to exist. A powerful entity, the Brown Stone Spire, could make it so they could stay together safely, but only by destroying the universe she came from, and every person in it. There was no path forward for their love that did not end in horror. There was no path forward without horror that did not end their love. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear what we have to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nazr sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo two people are worth so many lives. We must go our separate ways.\xe2\x80\x9d Already he could see the long evenings alone in his office, watching tapes of football plays and trying to recapture the innocent happiness he used to feel doing his job. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear to you because you have other options,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frances. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re from this world, and you could find another to love. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d tried Nazr, but predictions like this can never carry the weight of truth, because who can predict the heart?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou will\xc2\xa0find someone else,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, I will have to live alone forever or risk my own existence and the existence of everyone I entangled myself with. Can I even have close friendships or would those too result in an unraveling? Certainly \xc2\xa0I would be afraid to risk it, and in that fear I would settle into a bleak loneliness.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cSo what are you saying? That we should murder a universe of living beings?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m saying,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I love you, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to proceed from there.\xe2\x80\x9d After this argument, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk or see each other for a few days. Both of them felt completely overwhelmed by the weight of the decision. Both of them pretended it was a settled question for themselves. \n\n And now corrections. Despite previous reports, the ineffable isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. It\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, a trace. A sandwich left on a park bench. A misunderstood smile from an unfriendly crowd. The accidental arrangement of the sky. The distance from the Earth to the moon. The way grass feels when it gets a little dry. A hand reaching blindly into a drawer. A word spoken once and never again said aloud. A dream which seemed prophetic, but evaporated upon waking. A stain in a shirt that\xe2\x80\x99s source is a mystery. A bird with three missing feathers. A math problem with no possible solution. A signpost to a place which never existed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a trace, a joke. The ineffable isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. We apologize for our previous mistaken report.\n\n During the days apart, Frances and Nazr were not alone. They were not alone first in ways that were mundane and expected. For instance, Nazr had his team, and while he was distracted and morose, he was also determined not to let this affect the chances of his good kids. And so he forced himself to double his efforts when it came to practices. And if any of the team members of faculty thought anything about his behavior during this time, it was that he seemed especially dedicated and focused. And so therefor his relationship must be benefiting him.\n\n Frances had her customers. And while an antique store doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually bustle, it does have a steady stream. And the goal is to sell a few high-end items a day, along with a good amount of cheap trinkets, so that it all evens out, and she would have enough money to eat for another month. She had friends, too, except now she felt they weren\xe2\x80\x99t her friends. Her friends were back in another universe and the people here looked like her friends, but did not share exactly the same experiences this Frances remembered. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if this should matter but felt that it did, and so avoided her friends. Her friends when they talked, thought she must be so focused on her happy relationship that she no longer had time for them, and they felt resentment. They did not resent her personally, but rather resented the situation. \n\n But Frances and Nazr were not alone in a more malevolent way as well. Every evening, Barks Ennui visited each of them. Frances no matter where she went would find him sitting next to her. He would sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cFrances!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say softly. \xe2\x80\x9cFrances!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice was almost kind, but his eyes were pivoted toward her unnaturally, giant 2-D sources on a 3-dimensional yellow snout. \xe2\x80\x9cFrances, oh Frances,\xe2\x80\x9d he would murmur until she slept or thought she slept. He was less gentle with Nazr. With Nazr, he screamed. No words, merely a high keening in the living room as Nazr tried to watch game tapes, or in the bathroom as he washed his teeth. First a mundane quiet and then suddenly a huge dog screaming, cartoon eyes and cartoon mouth both gaping in terror. Why was Barks afraid? He was the specter who was haunting Nazr, but Barks was\xc2\xa0afraid. This made Nazr even more afraid. \xe2\x80\x9cStop screaming!\xe2\x80\x9d he would scream back, but Barks didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hear. \n\n And now sports news. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of Night Vale football, because I love our town, and our kids who are out there playing, and our fabulous coaching staff. But to be honest, I\xe2\x80\x99m often a little shaky on how the sport works, so I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d try a little experiment. I will now attempt, without looking up anything or consulting anyone lese, to explain the rules of football form memory. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, the kids enter the field. Uh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of them, they\xe2\x80\x99re all padded up and ready. Uh, \xe2\x80\x9choorah\xe2\x80\x9d they say, and others shout: \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s get the football!\xe2\x80\x9d They are there to get the football. They line up facing each other, uh someone shouts some numbers that they like, in order to get them in a happy headspace before starting the game, and then the football is thrown weird. It could be thrown much easier, but they throw it in a weird way. The quarterback catches the ball, mostly, uh sometimes they miss and that\xe2\x80\x99s a foul. But if they catch it, then they try to sneak it down the field. The ball needs to get going, but no one can know the team is doing it, and so they try to act nonchalant. Oh, and also the slam dance with the other team in order to show that they\xe2\x80\x99re only there to party. And no football is going down the field, mm mm, no way. [whispers] But it is! \n\n The other team figures this out and jumps at the football. Eventually, the football is carried to what is called the \xe2\x80\x9cend zone\xe2\x80\x9d, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a zone at the end of the field. There it transforms from a leather bag into a victory. There is more dancing, uh you know football is mostly about dancing. There\xe2\x80\x99s some other stuff like sometimes it turns into soccer for a little bit and they bring on a soccer player to do that, but mostly it\xe2\x80\x99s about dancing and sneaking, which are two of my favorite activities. Wow! No wonder I love football. This has been sports news. \n\n Nazr and Frances made the night as romantic as they could. They lit candles, because the risk of house fires is of course very romantic. They had flowers on the table, because the reminder of how plants grow is considered a great aphrodisiac among people who get really revved up about plants. Neither Nazr or Frances were one of those people, but still, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not too late,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could still be together.\xe2\x80\x9d This didn\xe2\x80\x99t help the romantic mood. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would we become if we caused so much loss, just for our own petty happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what this is?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPetty?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6 what isn\xe2\x80\x99t petty against the span of all of it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d But he could not be persuaded. She gave up and instead, she kissed him. He had never felt such a kiss, because he had never before kissed anyone out of a quiet and desperate grief. I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend that context to any of my listeners, but it does make for one hell of a kiss.\xc2\xa0\n\n Then she left his house. Nazr sat all night with the decision they had made. It was the correct decision. But if that was true, then why did he feel so completely like a person buried under rocks or locked into a cell with no light for months? He felt as though he would never take another free breath of air. There was no longer an other version of himself in his home, but it also felt to him that perhaps there was no one in his home. That the version of himself that was a human being existed only in the past tense, and from here on out, there was only this quotation of Nazr. And out of context excerpt stripped of meaning. \n\n He stood for a while before walking down to his car and pulling it out of the garage. It was almost morning. The Radio Shack wasn\xe2\x80\x99t open and packed with technology-craving customers yet, so he parked there and walked the rest of the way up to the humming Spire. He fell to his knees. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his decision to make, but he had already made the decision. \xe2\x80\x9cBrown Stone Spire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made my choice. Destroy the other universe. I have to be with her, no matter what.\xe2\x80\x9d The Spire did not reply. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. He slapped his palms against the hard packed earth again and again until they stung. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided! Destroy the other universe!\xe2\x80\x9d The Spire hummed to life. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from deep in its core. Nazr, murderer of billions, walked away slowly toward his car. \n\n The ending of our story coming up. But hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s check in on today\xe2\x80\x99s weather. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPieces and Pieces\xe2\x80\x9d by The Rough and Tumble]\n\n At first, Nazr walked with shame. But what use, after all, was shame? He had done what he had done so he and the woman he loved could live together in happiness. It would be a waste of everything, the worst of all possible outcomes, if he had agreed to such a monstrous price, only to have any possible renumerative happiness ruined by the guilt of what he had done. He made the decision then and there to leave it behind him. By the time he had reached his car, still waiting in the Radio Shack parking lot as if nothing of import had happened in the intervening minutes. He had set aside the choice as a matter of the past, and started to feel the first spark of joy in his heart. \n\n For the last few weeks, he had felt a strangeness, which he now knew was the feeling of falling out of step with reality. And now, the feeling was gone. He felt human again. He started the car, drove directly to Frances\xe2\x80\x99 house. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see her. He had never felt such a complete hunger for another person, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible no one in all of history had ever paid such a price to be with another person. \n\n And there was that person before him, tending to her garden in the cool morning sun. he did not think about a universe and everyone in it, including another version of Frances who no longer existed. He thought about this Frances. He watched her for a long moment from his car, feeling a blissful lack of urgency. They had a life together. What would a few more minutes be? So he let those minutes pass, watching her work, and then he stepped out of the car and approached her. She looked up with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHiya,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to the Spire and I did it.\xe2\x80\x9d He realized he was crying, but he was also smiling. She frowned, stood, took a step back. \xe2\x80\x9cDid what?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean \xc2\xa0I-,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI made the choice, you were right.\xe2\x80\x9d She held the clippers in front of her, not quite towards him, but not quite not. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe this is something that the other Frances would understand? I suppose a certain confusion was going to be unavoidable, but I do wish you\xe2\x80\x99d calm down.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe other Frances? In the other universe?\xe2\x80\x9d He did not know what was going on. \xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSweet lady, or is that immodest? Anyway, she told me that she asked the Brown Stone Spire to take her back to her own universe where I had been stuck. She said we had gotten mixed up, and things weren\xe2\x80\x99t working out for her here. So she showed me how to come back to my world and she went back to hers. She said at least we\xe2\x80\x99d have a chance at happiness this way. She also said he hoped you were as nice in her world as you are in ours.\xe2\x80\x9d She eyed Nazr\xe2\x80\x99s sweaty face, the desperate lean of his posture. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you nice, Nazr?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShe went back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Not a question but a surrender. \xe2\x80\x9cTo her world. To her\xe2\x80\xa6 universe.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Frances who barely knew him at all. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I do want to get back to my gardening.\xe2\x80\x9d Nazr returned to his car, but had nowhere he wanted to go. He watched the Frances who was not his Frances, but she glared at him, so he drove aimlessly and stopped again. His Frances was gone, along wither entire universe. Before hew as aware of it, he was already shouting . \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, let me reverse it!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease take it back!\xe2\x80\x9d Barks Ennui, in his awkward 3-dimensional body, was sitting on the passenger seat. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no taking it back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will make you a one-time offer. If you like, I will let you join her in oblivion. It is not mere death, it is an absolute ceasing of existence, forever. Blip, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone. Do you want this?\xe2\x80\x9d Nazr looked into the dog\xe2\x80\x99s distended eyes. He looked and looked. Two weeks later, he returned to school. He went back to football, re-doubled his dedication to his team. A complete focus on football may not be much of a life to many folks, but it is a life. There are many different kinds of life, and most of them are nothing special at all. Frances, a different woman quite literally from the one we started this story with, continued to run the Antiques Mall. What delighted her most was how objects existed here, in the moment, that everything existed all at once, right now. She loved the present. She thought little about tie. Outside her window, a plane passed overhead. No one watched ist passing.\n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: We regret to inform you that this entire podcast series has been viral marketing for Dippin\xe2\x80\x99 Dots.
