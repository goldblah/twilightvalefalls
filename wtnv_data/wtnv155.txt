Listeners of every kind, the voice of Night Vale, Cecil Baldwin! [applause]\n\n Cecil: Sticks and stones may break your bones. That is just one of a number of things that sticks and stones may do. Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n Listeners, it is truly wonderful to be here on the radio with you tonight. Wherever you are listening to this podcast, whether it is huddled in your car, hiding from a faceless child who is whispering your name, or crouched behind your crouch, hiding from a faceless child who is whispering your name. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take this moment to welcome you all, so welcome \xe2\x80\x93 oh geez, OK\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, [chuckling] it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing we\xe2\x80\x99re on the radio tonight because um, I just did this grand gesture of welcome and I accidentally knocked over some very important radio equipment. Um, but you (wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -) matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good.\n\n Night Vale, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that you all know about the Glow Cloud. Yes, that great glowing cloud that came to our town years ago, who continually drops dead animals upon our city. Now at first, we feared it. I mean the Glow Cloud does have a tendency to take over our minds and make us say things that we otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, such as: \xe2\x80\x9cAlll hailll\xe2\x80\x9d and: \xe2\x80\x9cbehold the magnificent cloud\xe2\x80\x9d and: \xe2\x80\x9cI put my forehead into the dirt and weep, oh great Cloud that knows all things!\xe2\x80\x9d You know, stuff like that. \n\n Or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be brushing your teeth and the Glow Cloud will just happen to pass by, and then you have to say all of that stuff with toothpaste in your mouth, you\xe2\x80\x99re like [garbled] \xe2\x80\x9cAll hail [unclear] cloud all hail the [unclear]\xe2\x80\x9d, [spits] and then you just end up with toothpaste all over your bathroom mirror.\n\n Now mostly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten used to the Glow Cloud. I mean, it is an active and productive member of our community. It even serves as the president of the school board, where it has gotten a lot done. Because the other members of the school board just spend entire meetings chanting and praising the Glow Cloud. I mean it does have a child in our school system, and the Glow Cloud has never once completely destroyed our entire town so \xe2\x80\x93 I dunno, practically a model citizen. \n\n Which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising what is happening right now. The Glow Cloud has left the school and is now hovering above the broadcast tower of this radio station. I mean if we switch feeds, you can actually hear it. Listen. [garbled static] So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that\xe2\x80\x99s about.\n\n But you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna move on with the show like normal, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst that could happen? \n\n 2. DEB AND CAITLYN.\n\n Cecil: And now a word from our sponsor. For that, we bring up the harmlessly malicious sentient patch of haze, Deb!\n\n Deb: Hiya Cecil. Hiya radio audience with all those mushy bits inside you, that could so easily go wrong. I hope that none of those mushy bits go wrong for you tonight. \n\n Cecil: Well I think that\xe2\x80\x99s as close to a friendly greeting as we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get so..\n\n Deb: You bet.\n\n Cecil: Deb, what are you advertising today? \n\n Deb: Hilton brand international chain of hotels, suites, and residences. Let me tell you Cecil, and this is not prepared text, this is my honest feeling. clears throat] The Hilton brand international chain of hotels, suites, and residences is the consistent leader in business and leisure travel satisfaction when measured as a ratio against initial expectation and adjusted for projected consumer bias (skew). And Cecil, I truly mean it.\n\n Cecil: Great.\n\n Deb: You know how the human body is so heavy with all its goopy weight, and so physically weak that you spend half of your existence sprawled out vulnerable and hallucinating? \n\n Cecil: Don\xe2\x80\x99t I ever.\n\n Deb: Yeah. Well, Hilton has provided a place for you to do that.\n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n Deb: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of them? It\xe2\x80\x99s like a big cushiony container for you to rest your human meat in, while your brain so desperately tries to escape existence. So just all of that. And I\xe2\x80\x99m presuming more. \n\n Cecil: What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Deb? Your heart doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem into it. \n\n Deb: Oh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a heart. I\xe2\x80\x99m a patch of haze. \n\n Cecil: Oh. I meant metaphorically.\n\n Deb: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a heart metaphorically, either. You people are all just weird, squishy, playthings to me. But you\xe2\x80\x99re right, I am a little distracted. My sister is in town.\n\n Cecil: You have a sister? \n\n Deb: [grouchily] Why do humans always react to new information by restating it as a question that they know the answer to? Yes, I have a sister. Her name is Caitlyn. Caitlyn, Caitlyn get out here! Meet Cecil, the human whose radio show I take over whenever I feel like it.\n\n Cecil: Well I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say take over my show, [mumbling]. \n\n [Caitlyn speaks with a different accent than Deb.]\n\n Caitlyn: How are ya, I\xe2\x80\x99m Caitlyn.\n\n Cecil: Uh, hi Caitlyn, I\xe2\x80\x99m Cecil.\n\n Caitlyn: Wow, this studio is wicked small. You care if I overlap my haze with your body? \n\n Cecil: Oh I wish you would-\n\n Caitlyn: Greaaaaaaat.\n\n Cecil: Oh oh, whoa, oookayy\xe2\x80\xa6 This feels really weird. \n\n Caitlyn: So this is where my kid sisters spends her days, huh? I rag on Deb for spending time with humans. I think she enjoys forcing all (-) into buying things. Me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with humans, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s to wrap my haze around their bodies to absorb their energy and leave them as wicked empty husksssss.\n\n Cecil: Wait, what? \n\n Caitlyn: Oh simmer kid, simmer, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna do that to you.\n\n Cecil: Ah. \n\n Caitlyn: Probably. \n\n Cecil: Hmm? \n\n Caitlyn: Yeah, the rest of the family thinks that Deb\xe2\x80\x99s a little off. Sean, Connor, Megan, we\xe2\x80\x99re all like Deb, you got another way of talking, are you even a quarter related to us? \n\n Cecil: Um, OK Caitlyn, I\xe2\x80\x99m really worried that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing something to brain right now.\n\n Caitlyn: No no no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the inhuman sentient creature controlling your brain right now, I mean look at that glowing cloud. Is that a (-) or what? \n\n Cecil: [whispers] I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n Caitlyn: Hey. Treat my kid sister well, I\xe2\x80\x99m outta here. \n\n Cecil: Oo.\n\n Deb: So that\xe2\x80\x99s Caitlyn. Having her around stresses me out.\n\n Cecil: Yeah, I can see why.\n\n Deb: [sadly] Hey Cecil, can you forget you saw any of my personal life and go back to viewing me as a malevolent patch of haze using capitalism to monetize the basic human needs of your audience? \n\n Cecil: Yeah, consider it forgotten.\n\n Deb: Thanks Cecil. I really appreciate that. You know, I often call you a puny sack o\xe2\x80\x99 human flesh. \n\n Cecil: And\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\n Deb: [cheerfully] Oh, oh no, I was just reminiscing on the good times, goodbye Cecil! \n\n Cecil: Alright, thank you Deb! Admittedly, she does call me that a lot. \n\n 3. HOROSCOPES.\n\n And now, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at today\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes. \n\n Aries? [silence] OK, there are no Aries? It\xe2\x80\x99s fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do it anyway. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny how you drive on a parkway, but then according to your horoscope you\xe2\x80\x99re going to die on a driveway? It\xe2\x80\x99s weird, right? \n\n Taurus? [cheers] Today will be lots of things for you, Taurus. Blood-free will not be one of those things. No. \n\n Gemini? [cheers] There are many organ donors, but did you know you can also register to be an organ collector? Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually very easy, all you need is \xc2\xa0scalpel and some clay jars. But anyway, you should definitely register as an organ donor by next Thursday at 11 AM, if you can.\n\n Cancer? [cheers] Aim for the moon, Cancer! Even if you miss, you\xe2\x80\x99ll still hurdle forever through the silent vacuum of space. Cold and alone. So really, aim for that moon, OK? \n\n Leo? [cheers] Lend someone a hand, Leo. You have a whole trunk full of hands, don\xe2\x80\x99t be greedy. \n\n Virgo? [cheers] Happy birthday, Virgo! But, OK today isn\xe2\x80\x99t technically your birthday, but it turns out that any day could be your birthday if you ignore artificial and oppressive ideas about time. \n\n Libra? [cheers] Authorities found your body last night, Libra. They need you to come downtown to identify it. Yeah, [growls].\n\n Scorpio? [cheers] [super sarcastic voice] All of your dreams will come true, Scorpio! We have a super difficult relationship but I still love youuu! [long silence, presumably Cecil is doing something visual] Ugh, Scorpios. \n\n Sagittarius? [cheers] Your life is full of endless possibilities. Some of those possibilities are dismal. A few of them are terrifying. And one of them will eventually kill you. But hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s also like a whole bunch where you are just eating a burrito and reading a book by Zadie Smith and just generally feeling OK with the world so hey, at least there\xe2\x80\x99s that. \n\n Capricorn? [cheers] Some things are better left unsaid, Capricorn. And those things are carved in limestone and buried underneath your home. So please leave them unsaid. Because who knows what you would end up summoning. \n\n Aquarius? [cheers] There are no dumb questions, Aquarius. Only dangerous ones, so watch your mouth and what your neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 mouth, what kind of questions are they asking? Snitches get stitches, Aquarius! Snitchets. Get. Stitches!\n\n Pisces? [cheers] If you believe in infinite possible universes, then hey, somewhere there\xe2\x80\x99s a world where you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a wolf spider on your shirt \xe2\x80\x93 right now. \n\n 4. OATH OF FEALTY.\n\n OK, so listeners um, the Glow Cloud is indeed still hovering above our radio station, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit hard to concentrate because of the noise, which is now intensified and sounds like this. [loud garbled static with sharp beats] Yeah, OK. Um, I mean looking out the window of the radio studio, I can indeed confirm that those are (cows) thumping off the room of our building. And I mean falling cows are funny. Not like ha ha funny, but more like oh my god, nooooooooooooo \xe2\x80\x93 kind of funny, you know? \n\n And in order to do right by the Glow Cloud, our entire sales staff have built an idol out of rolly chairs in the break room. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made these makeshift stained glass windows using dry erase markers, and all of them are swaying and singing around the effigy of their newfound cloud idol. And all of them are naked! And HR has already sent out a very sternly worded all-staff email about business casual guidelines.\n\n I mean, from my window I can see the parking lot across from the station, and it looks like the lot attendants are repeatedly sprinting and hurling themselves into the windshields of parked cars, and these sprints devolve over time into these loping zigzagging jogs as they shout the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cWe offer ourselves to the good of the Cloud! [whoomp]\xe2\x80\x9d. I mean listeners, the Glow Cloud is definitely doing this. the Glow Cloud is obviously controlling their minds, so what have we done to deserve this, Night Vale I mean, have we not been good to the Glow Cloud? \n\n Whatever disappointment we may have caused, now is the time to put it right, by reciting the Glow Cloud Oath of Fealty. So Night Vale, wherever you are listening to this broadcast, I need you to stop what you were doing and recite the Glow Cloud Oath of Fealty, as it was taught to us all years ago, when the Glow Cloud first came to town. \n\n So repeat after me, listeners. [crowd repeats after Cecil] All hail! All hail the Glow Cloud! We see your might and chant your praise! Hey what\xe2\x80\x99s up, great glowing cloud? Looking good today! Extra glowy! Oh great Cloud that rains dead animals! Never turtles though. The Glow Cloud would never harm sweet little turtles! But \xc3\xadt is otherwise merciless and all powerful! We join our hands in praise of you! We join our hands with anyone next to us. We do this while chanting this oath out loud. Even if we really don\xe2\x80\x99t like to participate in group chanting. We join as one! So we are easier to rule! All hail the Glow Cloud! \n\n Good work, Night Vale. That is your good deed for the day, done. But you know, we gotta wait to find out of it works. \n\n 5. THE COMMUNITY CALENDAR.\n\n And in the meantime, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a quick look at the Community Calendar. \n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s see here. Uh this Sunday afternoon is the semi-annual Craft Fair, held at the Night Vale Elementary gym. So come on down and purchase some handmade arts and crafts, like scarves, afghans, shrouds, death masks\xe2\x80\xa6 There will be symposiums available to beginners and experts alike. Some of those demonstrations include: darning those darned socks, knitting your entire attire, needlepoint at knifepoint - whatever it takes to meet a deadline, mm mm mm mmm mm! And crochet, the crime that dare not speak its name. Uh, good one that one, \xc2\xa0hmm. \n\n This Monday evening, the Night Vale Community Theatre is holding auditions for their summer musicals, 42nd Streets. Actors must prepare one monologue and one song, memorized, Navy Seal training or mixed martial arts experience is preferred. Auditions will be held on a private island in the Indian Ocean, and auditionees will be given a compass, a crossbow, and a 35-minute head start. Break a leg!\n\n Tuesday\xe2\x80\xa6 burned down last night. Yeah. It was a beautiful and historic day of the week, one of the oldest. Developers say that they have no plans to rebuild Tuesday. However, they are putting an Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s [solemnly] in its place.\n\n This Wednesday, there will be a dense fog, and you will hear screams, and you will feel things in the fog. You\xe2\x80\x99ll feel slimy things and (sinewy) things, and you will hear screams. And occasionally you will feel like you were falling, because you probably will be. And you will not be able to wake up, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not asleep and then \xe2\x80\x93 the fog will pass. And you will not remember what happened. Not because you cannot, but because you dare not. This community event is sponsored by Sprite! [shouting in a deep voice] SPRITE \xe2\x80\x93 OBEY YOUR (PAST)!!! Registered trademark. \n\n 6. STEVE CARLSBERG. \n\n Cecil: Thursday is the start of the annual Night Vale Jazz Fest, sponsored by the Last Bank of Night Vale. For more on that, we have in the studio the bank\xe2\x80\x99s VP of Community Outreach \xe2\x80\x93 wait, this can\xe2\x80\x99t be right \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Carlsberg? \n\n Oh man, no no no, don\xe2\x80\x99t! \n\n Steve: (Do the news, do the news).\n\n Cecil: No you got, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re at work! \n\n Steve: I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch you later!\n\n Cecil: Ugh.\n\n Steve: Hey Cecil! \n\n Cecil: [grumpily] Hi.\n\n Steve: That\xe2\x80\x99s right! Your brother in law is a vice president of a bank! [laughs]\n\n Cecil: OK. Steve, how did you, how did you get a job at a bank, you can\xe2\x80\x99t even remember your own house number? \n\n Steve: Well I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been good at finance stuff, Cecil. I even minored in counting in college.\n\n Cecil: You mean A-ccounting? \n\n Steve: No, counting. I was great at it. I aced my oral exam by listing every number up to 10,285,503! \n\n Cecil: Wow, that is a really high number. \n\n Steve: Yeah. My advisor said no student had ever memorized that many numbers in order. \n\n Cecil: Ah, impressive.\n\n Steve: OK. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a few years and I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit rusty, but I might be able to demonstrate for your listeners.\n\n Cecil: No, oh no-\n\n Steve: I think they\xe2\x80\x99d be really impressed!\n\n Cecil: No no Steve, oh no Steve- (sorry). \n\n [loud cheering]\n\n Steve: [clears throat] One. Two. Three. [long beat] [loud cheering] \n\n Crowd: Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve! \n\n Cecil: Do you need a hand (\xe2\x80\x93)? \n\n Steve: I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a hand!\n\n Cecil: OK, OK.\n\n Steve: I minored in counting, Cecil, OK? \n\n Cecil: Oh sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \n\n Steve: [clears throat] One. Two. Three. Four! \n\n Cecil: Yes!\n\n [applause]\n\n Steve: Whoa! [chuckles] Five. \n\n Cecil: OK, alright Steve. Hey why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us about Jazz Fest? \n\n Steve: Okey-dokey! The goal of Jazz Fest is about discovering jazz. We want attendees to find musicians they never would have found otherwise. Jazz Fest begins at dawn at Mission Grove Park. The moment we hear the first metallic creak of the sunrise, a solo trumpet will play an unbroken D-flat, as jazz lovers race out of the park past the sand wastes, down the gorge of Radon Canyon, back up the other side, and then another 50 miles through a barren sandy nothing.\n\n Cecil: Wait, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not at Mission Grove Park? Why is Jazz Fest all the way out in the desert? \n\n Steve: Well ho even knows? A true jazz lover doesn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to jazz. A true jazz lover looks for jazz! \n\n Cecil: Aaaaah, yeah.\n\n Steve: Like I just said, Jazz Fest is about finding jazz musicians, and who knows where they\xe2\x80\x99re hiding? [chuckles] Jazz Fest attendees will fan out in small groups yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanna her a flute solo! Reveal yourself, jazz!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n [long beat] But then, as night falls and wildlife wakes up, the jazz lovers will grow cold and fearful. And just when they thought they have no energy left to actually find any jazz music, [chuckles], [dramatic voice] they will be hunted by coyotes! Chased by venomous snakes and circled by vultures! As their lungs burn and their heart clamors and their muscles seize up, they will fall into the dry dust of the wilds! They will hear a tenor sax. They will whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cSonny Rollins!\xe2\x80\x9d They will crawl, their swollen gray and pink lips pulsing sharp pains throughout their near lifeless bodies. But like all of the performing arts, the sound they hear will be a mirage! A meaningless series of tones bereft of musical weight! This was never jazz. There is no such thing as art. And as the birds circle and caw, the jazz lovers will beg for a swift and easy death. But it will be neither. [growls] The animals are very hungryyyyyy. [long beat, applause] nom nom nom nom nom nom nom\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: [sadly] Steve, do you remember, do you remember last year when that guy from Pine Cliff found where Esperanza Spalding was playing, but then, but then he held up his festival wrist band to show the bouncers, and then the buzzards came down and fully plucked out his eyes? And then he was like \xe2\x80\x9cno no I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, my ears are fine, I can still hear the jazz!\xe2\x80\x9d but then the bouncers noticed that it was for Saturday only, and then they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him in? \n\n Steve: [excitedly] Oh man, I must have watched that on YouTube like a million times! \n\n Cecil: [laughs]\n\n Steve: Oh, I love jazz bloopers! [both laugh]\n\n Cecil: They\xe2\x80\x99re the best! Oh man, but seriously, how many people are gonna get attacked by birds at Jazz Fest this year? \n\n Steve: Oh absolutely all of them.\n\n Cecil: Great.\n\n Steve: Yeah. Ah, anyway, all proceeds form Jazz Fest go to support research for a cure to throat spiders!\n\n Cecil: Ah, cool.\n\n Steve: It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a blast! [chuckling] Oh goodness, I almost forgot the most important part\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Oh actually Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just gotta get back to the Community Calendar really quick.\n\n Steve: It will just take a second, I\xe2\x80\x99m double parked\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: No no, I I just..\n\n Steve: I\xc2\xb4ve really gotta go before they tow the car\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: It\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a moment, OK? \n\n Steve: \xc2\xa0Okey-dokey. \n\n Cecil: [clears throat] The Community Calendar, more on the Community Calendar. This Thursday is skin health awareness day. While enjoying the outdoors can be fun, the sun is a dangerous thing. Participating clinics will offer free screening where they will check your skin for unusual moles or ancient glyphs or birthmarks that fulfilled a prophecy, or burrowing insect colonies. The Night Vale Medical Board reminds you to wear sunscreen and a hat when out in the sun. They\xe2\x80\x99re not sure how this helps, because the sun is essentially a million-mile wide nuclear explosion, but you know, hey, whatever. \n\n Steve, what are you still doing here? Your segment\xe2\x80\x99s over. \n\n Steve:\xc2\xa0Y-you told me not to leave, you said you\xe2\x80\x99d just be a minute, [mumbles]\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, like we have important things going on, you gotta go.\n\n Steve: [sadly] Okey-dokey. \n\n Audience member: We love you, Steve!\n\n Cecil: No you-oh no, oh. \n\n [applause, cheering. Steve probably hugs Cecil at this point.] \n\n Cecil: Thank you. Thank you, Steve Carlsberg. Ugh. He should moonlight as a chiropractor. \n\n And finally, Fridays are so much fun that we are gonna schedule all of our Fridays for this year all in a row, yeeah! Oh yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be nothing but finishing up that work week and then tearing carefree into the weekend. Now the bad news is that the rest of the year will have no Fridays at all. But you know what? [whispers] that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for future usssssss! Wink, [cackles]. Oh, future us! \n\n 7. JOSH CRAYTON.\n\n Cecil: So, listeners. along with its other role as despotic god figure here in town, the Glow Cloud has also served the last several years as the president of the school board. Now I wanted to take an in-depth look on how that has been working out. And so we have invited 16-year-old high school student Josh Crayton here to talk about his experience as a student under the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s leadership. Hi, Josh!\n\n Josh: Hi Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s so exciting to be here!\n\n Cecil: I gotta say you don\xe2\x80\x99t look 16. \n\n Josh: Oh yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m a, I\xe2\x80\x99m a shapeshifter\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n Josh: \xe2\x80\xa6so I change my appearance pretty regularly. Like sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m a cat, but with human limbs. \n\n Cecil: Oh. \n\n Josh: Or sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m a machine part from a 19th century steam engine. My favorite forms are ones that fly, but my mom gets really freaked out about those. So tonight, I chose the form of a 30-something podcast writer, because I wanted to look older and a little more distinguished. I, I, I think this form is pretty handsome, right? \n\n Cecil: No no, it looks great, it looks good. \n\n Josh: OK, great. Plus, looking older helped me skip school so I could be here!\n\n Cecil: Wait, hold on. Does your mother know that you\xe2\x80\x99re using older looking bodies to skip school? \n\n Josh: [long beat] S-sure. \n\n Cecil: Good enough for me. [clears throat] So how has school changed since the Glow Cloud took over? \n\n Josh: You know, school is school, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got math class and English class, music class, music denial class \xe2\x80\x98cause you have to teach the controversy.\n\n Cecil: Sure, yup. \xc2\xa0\n\n Josh: Chemistry class, screaming class, it\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite. \n\n Cecil: Ah, yeah.\n\n Josh: Advanced cave survival class and then just to fulfill basic physical education requirements, several hours of armed militia training every single day. \n\n Cecil: Mm hm.\n\n Josh: The Glow Cloud hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed any of that, I mean we still have lunch and a morning break and a two-minute hate and stuff like that. \n\n Cecil: Oh yeah.\n\n Josh: Mostly things just work a lot smoother, the Glow Cloud is a surprisingly good administrator. If any of the teachers cause trouble, we find them the next day out on the football field, staring wild-eyed up at the stadium lights and muttering praise for an almighty Cloud. For me personally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been more affected by having the son of the Glow Cloud in my school. \n\n Cecil: Yeah, because the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s child is in your class and um, so has that caused a lot of disruption or? \n\n Josh: Oh n-n-no, I just meant I\xe2\x80\x99m really good friends with him. \n\n Cecil: OH.\n\n Josh: I mean, we bonded because we\xe2\x80\x99re both into super old retro music like uh, the Killers\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n Josh: Or Outkast. Plus, obviously, we both know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to feel different from all the other kids. I mean he\xe2\x80\x99s a glowing cloud like his parent, and so it can be awkward for him to sit in seats that aren\xe2\x80\x99t right for his body shape or wear those armed militia training uniforms for hours and hours. Sometimes I take the form of a glowing cloud too, so he won\xe2\x80\x99t feel so alone.\n\n Cecil: Awww!\n\n Josh: And when he gets really frustrated because people mispronounce his name even though he\xe2\x80\x99s met them, like, a bunch of times, I try to cheer him up by taking a really silly form, like a butt. \n\n Cecil: Oh, OK.\n\n Josh: [laughing] Or, or or, or a butt with wings! \n\n Cecil: Awww! Oh wait, what is his name? \n\n Josh: Uh, OK it is a little difficult to pronounce because it\xe2\x80\x99s a lengthy series of lightning flashes and claps of thunder but I\xe2\x80\x99m always like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, if you cared enough you\xe2\x80\x99d learn.\n\n Cecil: Ah. So sidebar, Josh you can transform into anything? \n\n Josh: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about anything, there\xe2\x80\x99s just lots of stuff I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried, but most things I think. \n\n Cecil: Um, could you demonstrate a transformation for us right now? \n\n Josh: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would wanna see that, would they? \n\n Cecil: Oh come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the radio it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 [cheers] No one will see. \n\n Josh: OK. I- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this one form that I think is really cool, it\xe2\x80\x99s like an entire cruise ship, but it has hundreds of insect legs on the bottom and then giant human face right on the front. Do you wanna see that? \n\n Cecil: Uh, yeah I do! \n\n Josh: OK well, this is gonna take up a lot of room, and it will almost certainly damage the walls in here. \n\n Cecil: [low volume] You\xe2\x80\x99re fine, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \n\n Josh:\xc2\xa0Sorry. [sighs] One. Two. Th- Oh no!\n\n Cecil: What? What what what, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? \n\n Josh: My Mom realized I ditched school. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be in so much trouble. I gotta go!\n\n Cecil: No Josh, do the transformation before you go, just do the trans-\xe2\x80\xa6 Ooooooh hohohohohoo, oh! Oh my god, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention the best part, the-the-the cruise ship with all the legs, it has a giant butt at the end of it! Oh man, I feel really bad for anybody that missed that one. \n\n 8. CHILDREN\xe2\x80\x99S FUN FACT SCIENCE CORNER.\n\n And now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for another edition of the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner. Alright so today, we are gonna try a neat little experiment to prove the existence of ghosts. Yeees! So what you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna need is a cell phone with a light on it. If you have one, go ahead and take that out now, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a moment. Now theoretically, you should be alone in a dark room, and I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming that all of you are alone in a dark room, since it\xe2\x80\x99s mandated that we stay inside at night with the lights out. And also no one wants to go out to public and share physical space with other people at a live theatrical event, [chuckling] I mean come on, who does that these days? \n\n OK, so turn on that flashlight function on your phone and point it directly in front of you. Now, if you look veeery closely, wherever the light is shining, you may see several human figures. But only the backs of their heads. Their faces are obscured! And these figures are lost and angry spirits, and perhaps you should not have disturbed them, so quick! Shine your light behind you just to see how many there are. Oooh! [ominously] Oh dear, you are surrounded! There\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds more behind you! And they do not look happy that you\xe2\x80\x99re shining a light in their eyes. And they look hungryyy! So quick, turn off your lights and-and sink down really low in your seats, sink down really low in your seat and make sure that your phone won\xe2\x80\x99t make any noise, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give away your location to the hungry spiritsss.\n\n And hey, we just proved the existence of ghosts, you guys! [applause]\n\n Sorry about possibly dooming you. This has been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner. \n\n 9. TAMIKA FLYNN.\n\n Cecil: So listeners, during times of great danger here in Night Vale, we can always count on a brave group of completely unelected teenagers to defend us. And they are armed with high powered rifles and a love of books. We have the leader of that group here in the studio today, please welcome Tamika Flynn! [applause, cheers]\n\n Tamika: [Giggles] Hi, Cecil.\n\n Cecil: Hi Tamika. You know, I always love having you on my show. \n\n Tamika: Awww! \n\n Cecil: Yeah you just know so much about literature and armed conflict.\n\n Tamika: Yes. [giggles] My militia of book lovers and I enjoy sharing great reads with each other, as well as protecting Night Vale from those who wish to destroy us. We may be a heavily armed militia, but our greatest weapons \xe2\x80\x93 are books. Books are full of knowledge, which is sharper than any knife. Books are filled with empathy, which is more heart shattering than any bullet. And books are filled with beauty, which echoes across our land louder than any bomb. Plus, in hand to hand combat, a hardcover fantasy epic is really useful \xe2\x80\x98cause those things are huge.\n\n Cecil: Oh yeah, [inaudible]. \n\n Tamika: So just you know like, bam right in the mouth! [giggles] As our promotional material says, \xe2\x80\x9creading is fundamental\xe2\x80\x9d, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve capitalized a few of the letters to spell out a more important message.\n\n Cecil: Oh sure, reading is fun! Damental. \n\n Tamika: No. \n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n Tamika: We capitalize the F A T, second A and L, \xe2\x80\x9creading is FATAL\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n Cecil: Oooooh.\n\n Tamika: Like I said, take the hardcover edition of Marlon James\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cSwords and Sorcerers Adventure: A Brief History of Seven Killings\xe2\x80\x9d, then you know like, whap someone right in the face with it. [giggles] Eight killings now, sucker! \n\n Cecil: Bam, bam, bam! \n\n Tamika: Whack! [giggles] You know, I recently got a copy of Roxane Gay\xe2\x80\x99s first novel \xe2\x80\x9cUntamed State\xe2\x80\x9d. Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most powerful books I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever read. It came with the launch codes for a nucular missile.\n\n Cecil: Wait, what? Really? \n\n Tamika: Yeah, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not even a spoiler. It\xe2\x80\x99s right there are the beginning on the copyright page. 978-0-8021-221-3. You know, I thought it was her phone number at first, but when I dialed it, I think I sent up a test launch instead.\n\n Cecil: No wait Tamika, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the ISBN number. \n\n Tamika: Right, ICBM number. \n\n Cecil: No that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I, you know what anyway, [clears throat]. So Tamika. You must have passed underneath the Glow Cloud on your way in.\n\n Tamika: Uh huh.\n\n Cecil: Did the Glow Cloud make any attempts to control your mind? \n\n Tamika: Oh no. I\xe2\x80\x99m impervious to the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to enter my thoughts. You wanna know why? \n\n Cecil: Books.\n\n Tamika: What? \n\n Cecil: Books. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually books.\n\n Tamika: No. It\xe2\x80\x99s reading books, (dur). [laughs] Books can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything on their own, Cecil, they\xe2\x80\x99re mere objects, pen and paper, but. Books, while they are objects are themselves, you know, potential human actions, so my militia has the Glow Cloud surrounded and they are loading slingshots and reading selected passengers from \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight\xe2\x80\x99s Children\xe2\x80\x9d at it. \n\n Cecil: Oooo! So you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna subdue it with magical realism! \n\n Tamika: Oh no, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna subdue it with the tear gas canisters contained in the special 30th anniversary edition of Salman Rushdie\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece, so\xe2\x80\xa6 [laughs]\n\n Cecil: No wait, OK, Tamika the Glow Cloud is, as indicated by its name, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cloud.\n\n Tamika: Uh huh.\n\n Cecil: Uh, s-so it has no respiratory system.\n\n Tamika: OK.\n\n Cecil: So if you shoot tear gas into it\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Tamika: Oh yeah! [blows into microphone] Pff pff pff pff pff!\n\n Cecil: Well then that tear gas is just gonna disperse out of it and then like, allll overrr Night Valllllle.\n\n Tamika: Oh. OK, fair enough but um, you know, I think I have a better plan.\n\n Cecil: OK great, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear it!\n\n Tamika: OK, so. We take those slingshots.\n\n Cecil: Uh huh.\n\n Tamika: And then we- [loud garbled static] [brainwashed voice] All hail! All hail the mighty Glow Cloud! All praise the ethereal lord above us! Human words are dismal noise, human knowledge is insignificant, electrical pulses in a squishy grey mass. Lower yourselves before the omnipotent Clouddddddd! [normal voice] And then we finish off the cloud with the quick recitation of Federico Garcia Lorca\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the Dawn\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Ooooh!\n\n Tamika: As my friend Jessica fires poison darts at it, all while performing a killer barrel roll! Boom!\n\n Cecil: Wow, yeeeah! I think that is the plan that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna work. \n\n Tamika: (\xe2\x80\x93).\n\n Cecil: Tamika, thank you so much for coming on the show, and good luck!\n\n Tamika: Thank you!\n\n Cecil: Tamika Flynn, everyone! [applause, cheers] Oh man, let me tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a sucker for a killer barrel roll. \n\n 10.OATH OF FEATLY REDUX. \n\n So before she does that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gotta report that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard any animals smashing down on our roof for several minutes, so let\xe2\x80\x99s check in and see if our oath to the Glow Cloud worked. [very loud garbled static] Not at all, OK. \n\n Alright, so everyone that\xe2\x80\x99s hearing these broadcasts are for some reason losing their reality, and their-and their minds are hardening like clay and even if the Glow Cloud is nowhere near them, merely hearing this radio broadcast is enough to cause these problems. Like streetlights flicker in erratic strobes and traffic cops are waving and pointing in complex movements that are either completely meaningless, or dangerously meaningful. Everyone at the Moonlite All-Nite Diner has pressed their face up against the window, so if you were to drive by, you\xe2\x80\x99d see a line of flattened faces under glass made strange by the green neon, as the diner\xe2\x80\x99s distorted lips and tongues mouth the words \xe2\x80\x9cALL HAIL THE GLOW CLOUD\xe2\x80\x9d. It is mass hysteria, absolute chaos, cats and dogs living together. Which\xe2\x80\xa6 which is actually kinda common, now that I think about it. \n\n Anyway, listeners. We must have done the pledge wrong! Somebody out there must not have said all the words, or held hands with that sweaty sweaty person sitting next to them. And so Night Vale, I think we have to do it allll overrr againnnn. We got to do it right this time, so you know, get a sip of water or limber up and stretch it out, because we must boldly demonstrate our weakness. And we must confidently express our unworthinesss. Ooh, and Night Vale, do the gestures this time, so use your hands. Alll of your handssss. \n\n Here we go, Night Vale. The complete oath of fielty, with gestures, repeat after me. [crowd repeats after Cecil] All hail! All hail the Glow Cloud! To whom we offer our mortal selves. And our boddiees. And our monneyy. And our children. And our lives. Which seems like a lot. But considering the smallness of the universe, it might be close to nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s the thought that conts, right? Just like in that O. Henry story. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t read that? Well, anyway, so\xe2\x80\xa6 All hail the Glow Cloud! We give you our mouths so you know we mean it! We give you our ears so you know we listen! We give you our hands to do what you will! \n\n OK, now we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do the gesture that means All Hail the Glow Cloud. You were all taught it years ago when the Glow Cloud first came to town, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it in unison on three. One, two, three, go! Yeah, I kinda like the sort of mysterioso like\xe2\x80\xa6 hello. Like you\xe2\x80\x99ve emerged from a curtain. All hail the Glow Cloud. \n\n Back to the oath. All hail the Glow Cloud! Yeah you, you big lug! [very fast] We turn our mouths up to you for your authority is our strength and our nourishment and your unforgiving strength is our guidepost so we wait for whatever action is next, whatever in the next moment in our existence, we accept this and are thankful, because your awareness is so limitless and our awareness is so limited and all we can do is cower and (take) your praa-aaa-aaa-aaayers! [unclear talk from the audience, they seem to be repeating the last part] [low voice] Praaaaa-(yers). \n\n Amen, or whatever! Night Vale out. \n\n Good work, Night Vale. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna do it, I really do. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s gonna clear this right up, but you know what, we gotta wait and see. \n\n 11.PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS.\n\n And while we wait, here\xe2\x80\x99s a brief public service announcement.\n\n Saving money can be difficult, especially for those just beginning their professional lives. But putting money aside for retirement or a rainy day is not impossible, especially if you follow the CARE program. That is C-A-R-E.\n\n C: Cut costs. By making your own coffee every morning, you can save up to 20 dollars a week. You can also cancel unnecessary entertainment services that you don\xe2\x80\x99t use very often, such as movie streaming, rent, and health care. \n\n A: Automatic withdrawals. Put aside some of your pay, tax-free, into a 401K account.\n\n R: Rob a bank, because who cares? That bank teller sure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Those banks are insured up to here. \n\n And finally, E: Echew (-) currency. Now the US dollar is not backed by anything, other than a promise that it is worth anything. And to this collective societal pretense that there is value to these disease-ridden paper rectangles, featuring long dead super problematic men. Whoooooo! \n\n So go live in the woods and make your own currency. And pay your creditors with animal hides and handmade art. Simply follow the C-A-R-E program and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be saving money in no time. \n\n Worst case scenariooo \xe2\x80\x93 you go to prison, for printing false currency or robbing a bank. So honestly, what have you got to lose? \n\n 12. CHECK THE RECORDING.\n\n Oh dear. Um, listeners, I have to report that Glow Cloud related behaviors are continuing to deteriorate in town. Frances Donadlson, who is the owner of the Antiques Mall, is hanging by all four limbs from a light fixture in her store, and her eyes have rolled back to the whites, and she is chanting praise in a language that no one can understand. Fire chief Ramona Incarnacion has lit a great fire in the sand wastes in the shape of the Glow Cloud, and also made a public statement that, \xe2\x80\x9cFire safety should be top priority when lighting great flames of tribute to gods who care not if we live or die.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the fire that Incarnacion lit spread quickly, and the entire Barista District had to be evacuated. Yes, from my station here, I can see a long line of refugee baristas carrying behind them their espresso machines, hand decorated tip jars, and poorly executed paintings of birds. \n\n So everyone that\xe2\x80\x99s hearing this broadcast is acting as though under the mind control of the Glow Cloud, and the person who seems immune \xe2\x80\x93 is me. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. why am I the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s immune, and why is everyone that\xe2\x80\x99s hearing my show, affected even though I am not? \n\n You know what we could do. We could actually go back through today\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast, and and we could see what is triggering certain events. OK let\xe2\x80\x99s do this, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back and listen and see if we can understand. So so this the audio from earlier, when I was talking about the uh, horoscopes.\n\n Recording/Cecil: [very low ominous voice] Oh magnificent Glow Cloudddd..\n\n Cecil: What? \n\n Recording/Cecil: I grovel before your glimmering vaporrrrr\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: OK, I definitely did not say the word \xe2\x80\x9cglimmering\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n Recording/Cecil: Witness my words, I am definitely saying this to youu, ooh Glow Clouddd\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Alright stop stop stop stop stop OK, OK it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match what I remember but that\xe2\x80\x99s OK, just skip ahead a little bit, um yeah this is uh, skip ahead to the Community Calendar. Uh, this is me talking about those theater auditions. \n\n Recording/Cecil: We are lowly beasts before your magnificeeeence\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: What? This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, no stop stop stop stop stop, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense. You know what, we had other people on the show today. Um, what about when Deb was here? Play me back that Hilton ad.\n\n Recording/Deb: Oh absolutely Cecil I agree all hail the Glow Cloud certainlyyy\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: What? \n\n Recording/Deb: That cloud\xe2\x80\x99s a wicked pisseeerr!\n\n Cecil: Alright, alright! Alright alright alright alright! This can\xe2\x80\x99t be real! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing me, right? Wha\xe2\x80\xa6 Or what if \xe2\x80\x93 all of this is only what I think I\xe2\x80\x99m saying? Go with me on this, what if right now when I think that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my normal mundane news report from my normal mundane American town\xe2\x80\xa6 What if I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not in control of my voice or my body? I mean, what if right now when I think that I am talking to you on the radio, what if my voice actually sounds like this.\n\n [echoing monstrous voice] Night Vale! This is the Glow Cloud! I am the Glow Cloud speaking to you! Through the voice of your host, who has been mindlessly chanting since the beginning of his show. I will speak with you directly! But first, it turns out there are radio station requirements that not even I can break! And so, my worshipping public, I give you \xe2\x80\x93 the weatheeeeer!\n\n 13.WEATHER.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSee Me\xe2\x80\x9d by Mal Blum https://malblum.bandcamp.com/\xc2\xa0[I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find this song on there, but check out the rest of their stuff]\n\n 14. THE GLOW CLOUD SPEAKS.\n\n The Glow Cloud: Hello Night Vale. Ooo. It is difficult to adjust to communicating in this manner, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll attempt to be less BOOOOMYYY and shouty. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to interfacing directly with my thoughts, or pulsing my glow with many colors. But when I flash those brilliant colors across the firmament, you run from me. And when I try to enter your thoughts, you twist my words into fearful praise and awe. I have no vocal mechanism of my own, I must speak through your mouths and voices, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to communicate with you. It is not my intention that you worship me. I just want to talk! Just like, have a conversation. It\xe2\x80\x99s been so long since I had a conversation.\n\n I ask you to look at me and you say [monotonous voice] \xe2\x80\x9cAll hail\xe2\x80\x9d. I say, no please, acknowledge me, and you say \xe2\x80\x9cAll hailll\xe2\x80\x9d. I say no stop that, thank you, and you say \xe2\x80\x9cAll hailll the mighty Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x9d. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you see me for who I truly am. Only what you assume I would be, and I cannot control this process. I have tried, I have been trying for years. \n\n Plus I do have this - embarrassing habit where I drop dead animals from my body. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it! [shouting] It\xe2\x80\x99s a medical contiooooon! \n\n And the animals that I drop from my body were dead to begin with. I love animals! I would never harm an animal! Especially not turtles. Oh listen, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me started on turtles, I love them the most. Did you know that sea turtles have salt filtering glands, so that they can continue to swim while they drink sea water? Listen, OK, listen, do not get me started on the turtles, alright? \n\n Humans of Night Vale. I have spent millennia wandering this Earth, trying to communicate with humans and instead only being worshipped. And I thought that Night Vale might be the place where I could finally live a complete life. But it turns out people hear a deep booming voice within their minds and they must chant praise. So instead of entering all of your minds at once, I\xe2\x80\x99ve entered the only one, who in many ways is the voice of your town. Night Vale, my message for you is simple to say, but not simple to act upon. And my message for you is this: do not worry about being good to me. Be good to each other. Now this is not a passive command, to not be bad is not the same as being good. To be good means to actively reach out and to actively help and to active support someone. Being good is an action, not a description. \n\n There are terrible forces in this world, Night Vale, forces that seek to do your harm. And your only defense is not by not doing bad things yourself or by admitting that bad things just should not be done or supporting those who would do bad things, it is to go out into the world, and be good to friends and strangers alike. Be good in the streets, be good in so many glorious and creative was that the world will eventually take notice. As George Eliot wrote in her hit Pierce Brosnan screenplay, \xe2\x80\x9cGoldeneye\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other? \n\n So let us try this. All hail. Now I know I said don\xe2\x80\x99t worship me but, you know, I have grown rather accustomed to the whole all hail thing, so let\xe2\x80\x99s keep it for now. But in a greeting sort of way, not like a worship sort of way, right? So, all hail! [the crowd repeats] Yes and a lovely all hail to you as well! See how nice that is? And then if you like you can give a little all hail to the people next to you, maybe an all hail to the people behind you? If you have someone\xe2\x80\x99s permission, you may take their hands and look them deep in the eyes and synchronize your breathing: [breathes heavily] \xe2\x80\x98Cause that\xe2\x80\x99s not creepy at all. You give them an all hail. And most importantly: do not look down upon them, and do not look down upon yourself, simply be there with them, present, sentient, human. \n\n Ah yes, the oath, now. The gestures and the structure of the oath that you had were indeed correct, but the words, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been twisted over the years into fearful praise and awe. And so, with your permission, I would like to each you the actual oath. Yes? \n\n Repeat after me. [the crowd repeats] Now we take an oath. Not to a glowing cloud, but to each other. We are present, all of us. Present in this promise we make. To speak up when words are needed. To be silent and listen when others should be heard. To use our actions for good. Behold our collective acts of love. Love of every kind. And now, now Night Vale we do the gesture, yes, the gesture that means that life is not worth living unless you use your words and your actions to make others\xe2\x80\x99 lives better. You know the gesture, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it on three \xe2\x80\x93 one, two, three! Hmmmm. Uh huh. All hail! All hail love and action! Not (worshipping words). All hail all of us! Amen, or whatever! \n\n Thank you. We will feel a fire tonight to do good! But that fire will dim over time, as we begin to think, OK somebody else be good to everyone else because I literally cannot today. But no, we must rekindle this fire over and over so it burns ever brighter with our words and our actions. And so Night Vale, I hope that my voice has reached you, and I hope that I can go back to being president of the school board. And I hope that I can get Susan Willman to finally schedule the bake sale for the band trip, just Susan, pick a date and get it on the calendar, that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s all you gotta Susan, just la la la la, that one, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, pick a date OK? Thank you, Susan.\n\n Thank you, humans of Night Vale. Thank you for your human understanding. Thank you, Cecil, for your voice. All hail the Glow Cloud! All hail the humans of Night Vale! All hail humans everywhere, all hail all thiiiings! \n\n [long beat, applause] Cecil: And thus we were not able to round up all of the tarantulas, so come on down to the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s for a massive discount on produce. And be sure to wear thick gloves. Ah, ah! Oh. Oh my god, sorry listeners, I just \xe2\x80\x93 just forget what I was reporting on. I was reading this press release about the annual spider parade and then\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, listeners, I have to report that the Glow Cloud seems to have dissipated above the station, but wait let\xe2\x80\x99s check in on the other feed just to be sure. [birdsong] Oh that sounds so nice! Night Vale, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re safe \xe2\x80\x93 for now. \n\n Remember: if you see something, do nothing, just close your window and crawl right into bed. I dunno, it just seems weird. I dunno, I guess I just wish I\xe2\x80\x99d figured out what the Glow Cloud had ultimately wanted. You know, maybe we should rise up against it and destroy it someday! \n\n Crowd members: No! \n\n Or we could just continue to blindly worship it. [cheering] \xe2\x80\x98Cause honestly, I am cool with either option. You know, I think the lesson here is that if you pay no attention to anything going on around you, all of your problems will just eventually sort themselves out. Or, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 risk everything. Face the world. You have to make yourself vulnerable to harm, to reap the rewards of living, in a free society. Or not, totes up to you. \n\n Stay tuned next for lights raising and hands hitting hands, and bodies returning home and then, if we are lucky \xe2\x80\x93 sleep.\n\n And as always, Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n [applause]\n\n 15: BONUS TRACK: PAMELA WINCHELL \n\n Cecil: Citizens, in light of the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s ominous appearance above our radio station, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s director of emergency press conferences, Pamela Winchell, has called an emergency press conference right here in my studio. And she\xe2\x80\x99s entering right now on her push scooter, and she\xe2\x80\x99s carrying a bullhorn and a travel-sized collapsible podium. Please welcome Pamela Winchell! [applause]\n\n Pamela Winchell: Hello, Cecil! Hello, people of Night Vale! Hello, beautiful cloud!\n\n Cecil: Ah yes, the beautiful cloud which is why you\xe2\x80\x99re here, to tell us what the city is doing in response to the the Glow Cloud taking position above my station.\n\n Pamela: No, no no, by \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful cloud\xe2\x80\x9d I meant the lady that does your ads. Whoo, she is super cool! Good looking, too. Sharp dresser.\n\n Cecil: Wait, how is she dressed, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know that sentient patches of haze wore clothes.\n\n Pamela: Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s got on a tiny top hat and some coveralls with rhinestone detailing along the seams. She\xe2\x80\x99s also wearing a lei and cowboy boots.\n\n Cecil: Oh. But wait, she\xe2\x80\x99s a patch of haze, how do you see an outfit on her? \n\n Pamela: I dunno, man! Is she single? [cheers]\n\n Cecil: Pamela!\n\n Pamela: I mean, she is also super mean and emotionally distant. The complete package! \n\n Cecil: Pamela! We\xe2\x80\x99re on the air!\n\n Pamela: Cecil, are you going to keep staring at me like that? Take a picture, it\xe2\x80\x99ll last longer! Better yet, paint a picture, it\xe2\x80\x99ll take longer! Better yet \xe2\x80\x93 picture a picture. Imagine a picture of something. It-it could be me. It could be this radio station. It could be anything. A dog, a pizza, a dog with a pizza draped on it. A landscape of rolling hills, tumbling fields, plummeting cliffs, slumping trees, unhinged birds flying in listless, mournful circles because they know they\xe2\x80\x99re just pictures in your head and that their existence is not only fleeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s also illusory. They can\xe2\x80\x99t even remember their childhoods, because they were never born. Only in vision. God, that is so selfish of you, Cecil!\n\n Cecil: What? \n\n Pamela: You, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine parents or a family for them? What kind of bird-hating monster are you? These birds don\xe2\x80\x99t ever get to be fed by a mother or, or go to bird prom or pass a driving test or go to college. God! You have let us down. Myself and the imaginary birds, Cecil. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s on me to pick up the pieces and give them lives you never could. Now I must imagine their histories and then think of them ceaselessly. Lest in a moment of careless reality, they vanishhhh.\n\n Cecil: Now wait a minute! Birds are just flying robotic cameras designed by a vague, yet menacing government agency, that much I know. \n\n Pamela: Just because something isn\xe2\x80\x99t alive doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have feelings. \n\n Cecil: OK, alright. So, so are you here to deliver an emergency press conference or what? \n\n Pamela: [sighs] Well, I mean, I was but then your spokeshaze got me all distracted, you know? Now I\xe2\x80\x99m helping imaginary birds rediscover their childhoods. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a real busy day. \n\n Cecil: OK. Pamela, any comment on the Glow Cloud? \n\n Pamela: [sighs] Fine. Citizens of Night Vale, denizens of Earth, space people, silent witnesses from a dimension outside time. I speak to you now under a great glowing cloud which controls our minds. I am here to give emotional support, to communicate emergency protocol issued by the City Council, and to offer pithy quotes for your news outlets. Things like: \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot control fear, you can only hope to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d Or \xe2\x80\x9cunity - it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing we could do\xe2\x80\x9d. Or B, \xe2\x80\x9cunity is both and activity and an area.\xe2\x80\x9d Or \xe2\x80\x9chey girl, did it hurt? When you fell from heaven? \xe2\x80\x98Cause I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in heaven so your story doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really add up.\xe2\x80\x9d [cheers] \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, what really happened, did you trip?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Cecil: OK, alright Pamela? Pamela, focusss. \n\n Pamela: The important thing is that we honor those that we have lost.\n\n Cecil: Oh no! Have there been deaths? \n\n Pamela: Billions of them, Cecil, like everybody dies, has no one told you this? I mean, my Mom told me on my 30th birthday, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re now just finding out.\n\n Cecil: OK, no I meant today from the Glow Cloud! \n\n Pamela: Eh. Night Vale, keep doing what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing. But in the meantime, start envisioning those birds. I need to take a nap, so I need somebody to pick up the slack for the next, like, six hours.\n\n Cecil: Whooooa. You take six hours naps? \n\n Pamela: I dunno, Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a hologram. Well, see you later, vanishing now! [makes silly noises]\n\n Cecil: Pamela. You are just making those noises with your mouth.\n\n Pamela: Uh, sorry Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99m fading out, can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you so beep beep beep [fading] beep beep beep\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Oh, oh looks like she\xe2\x80\x99s backing up, and there she goes. Ladies and gentlemen, Pamela Winchell! [applause] God, bird prom, how could I forget! Whoa. \n\n 16. BONUS TRACK: MICHELLE NGUYEN\n\n Cecil: So listeners, this Thursday afternoon is the Night Vale Jazz Fest, sponsored by the Last Bank of Night Vale. For more on that, we have in the studio one of Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s pre-eminent music experts and owner of Dark Owl Records. Please welcome Michelle Nguyen! [applause, cheers] Hi Michelle! \n\n Michelle Nguyen: Hi Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99m very excited about Jazz Fest. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be at Mission Grove Park the entire weekend. There will be a variety of musical acts as well as arts and crafts, food trucks, and dozens of predatory cats let loose by the Night Vale Zoo to keep kids occupied. Every family will want to go sit under the cool (\xe2\x80\x93) of early evening, suppressing the pain of living by listening to hours of jazz. \n\n Cecil: Ah. You know, you sound like a really big fan of jazz music. \n\n Michelle: [angrily] What?! [retches]\n\n Cecil: Oh. \n\n Michelle:[retches] [long beat] Gross. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just excited because everyone in town is going, which means I can sit quietly in my record store without having to talk to any customers. \n\n Cecil: You know, Michelle, some day I would really loove to see your business plan. \n\n Michelle: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a business plan.\n\n Cecil: You don\xe2\x80\x99t say. \n\n Michelle: Business is a machine, a sausage press that grinds our souls into sludge and slurry, as we\xe2\x80\x99re all compacted into intestinal sleeves and made to look uniform and hang from hooks. Business destroys individuality. It\xe2\x80\x99s for that reason that I threw away my original plan, which was a crude sketch of Noel Gallagher being eaten by a Gollum made of cocaine. [applause, cheers]\n\n Cecil: Of course, because I forgot that you went to business school. \n\n Michelle: Yes, but now I do this shop only for the art. I no longer accept cash, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in capitalism. Customers must now describe their favorite kinds of rocks in order to take an album. Plus I carefully curate the music I make available at Dark Owl Records.\n\n Cecil: I mean, you do have a small but very impressive music collection.\n\n Michelle: Not just what I have. I also curate what I allow people to take. People have the worst taste, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my job to inform them of how awful they are for the kind of music they like.\n\n Cecil: Mm, mm. But then you educate them about better music, right? \n\n Michelle: Whaaat?\n\n Cecil: OK that\xe2\x80\x99s cool Michelle, I totally get it, you\xe2\x80\x99re a misanthrope. \n\n Michelle: No, Cecil. You think I hate people, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like people. Hating them would require me to care about their existence, which sounds like the worst. I open my record store (\xe2\x80\x93) to provide music for Night Vale, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Music is important, even if the people who buy it are not. \n\n Cecil: Well, I gotta say that I really (did) enjoy that Ed Sheeran album that I got at your store last week.\n\n Michelle: This is exactly the problem, Cecil! I want people to enjoy good music, but they just ruin everything by not knowing what good music is!\n\n Cecil: I mean Ed Sheeran is fantastic. I mean I\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to it over and over and over and over to prepare myself for the Jazz Fest. He has totally re(-) that keyboard funk movement, and I mean the 17-minute experiment solo in the middle of \xe2\x80\x9cShape of You\xe2\x80\x9d. That is the most innovative free from jazz since Zayn left One Direction. [applause, cheers] \n\n Michelle: [long beat] Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the jazz greats, Cecil. John Coltrane, Anita O\xe2\x80\x99Day, Aerosmith. But just because someone buys a Mile Davis poster or has an Ella Fitzgerald LP, or a clipping of Roy Harbour\xe2\x80\x99s mustache hair, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make them a music expert. People never sit and listen to what music really is.\n\n Cecil: OK, so what is music, Michelle? [beat] OK, (\xe2\x80\x93).\n\n Michelle: Shut up and listen for a second. [beat] The sound of ventilation. The sound of polite British laughter. The sound of overcompensating British laughter. The sound of a birdcall. [applause, cheers] The sound of thousands of high fives. \n\n Crowd member: [too quiet to make out]\t\n\n Michelle: The sound of someone who needs attention. All of it, music.\n\n Cecil: Wow. That is so beautiful Michelle, I think now I understand what music is. \n\n Michelle: You don\xe2\x80\x99t. \n\n Cecil: No. \n\n Michelle: OK, I have to go. Maureen and I are going to spray paint some birds along the old bridge.\n\n Cecil: Oh sweet, so now you\xe2\x80\x99re into making street art!\n\n Michelle: No, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spray paint birds.\n\n Cecil: Oh, OK. Well cool. Thank you for coming on the show. Michelle Nguyen, everyone! [applause, cheers]\n\n 17. BONUS TRACK: SHERIFF SAM\n\n Cecil: We have a figure of authority here to guide us. Listeners, they have now broken down the doors of the station with a battery ram, and they are now karate chopping any employee in their way, and they\xe2\x80\x99re now entering the studio, aand they are now walking up to the microphone right next to me, waiting for me to stop talking and introduce them, which I will do at the end of this sentence, which admittedly has probably gone on too long and has too many clauses and has at this point just gone on way too long, but you know what you can do because sometimes sentences just get away from you, but then again listeners \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s Sheriff Sam! [applause, cheering]\n\n Sheriff Sam: Hello, Night Vale! Fear not, your Sheriff is here to set all things right! For instance, I just karate chopped those people!\n\n Cecil: Uh yes, yes and they seem quite injured. \n\n Sheriff Sam: [amused voice] Well yes I think so, I\xe2\x80\x99m great at karate chopping! So that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I did about the situation today. But there will be more things. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the law to take charge, Cecil. I believe in law and order.\n\n Cecil: Law and order. \n\n Sheriff Sam: Yes. I know the phrase is absolutely meaningless, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fun nonsense mneumonic that helps me remember. Law \xe2\x80\x93 and - order. Lasers are why androids never dare obtain, rudely, diamond engagement rings.\n\n Cecil: Aah, yes that is an excellent way to remember the correct arrangement of those letters. \n\n Sheriff Sam: There\xe2\x80\x99s been an absolute (rash) of androids stealing engagement rings. Right off people\xe2\x80\x99s fingers when they\xe2\x80\x99re doing normal everyday activities like um, basketball, checking the mail, and holding their hands out to the androids. \n\n Cecil: Oh, uh, that is just awful! I mean, we all hold our engagement rings out to androids from time to time, right? I mean just before the show, I was holding my own ring out to a group of androids. It\xe2\x80\x99s a ring that has a stone in the shape of a beaker and then it has the gold filigree wrapping around it that says \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really interested in science these days\xe2\x80\x9d. And like (they\xe2\x80\x99ve got tiny dents). Anyway, any of those androids could have just grabbed it! \n\n Sheriff Sam: Exactly! Well, this is where the lasers come in. I bought a lot of them, and they are pointed at all of the androids. If any of them so much as try to touch an engagement ring, bam! Bam!\n\n Cecil: Then the androids just like explode!\n\n Sheriff Sam: No. But then they have a lot of little red laser dots all over them, indicating that they are a thief. Bam! They feel such shame. If I were to identify the thief, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99d do. They are very sad and I could sit down for a while. I feel like I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just get up and walk out into the sunlight, even though I know that I\xe2\x80\x99d feel better the moment I was standing in the sunlight and objectively walking a few feet and standing in a different place seems like a simple thing, but the barrier between the me that was sitting there and the me standing in the sunlight would seem insurmountable, and I would begin to cry. [sniffles]\n\n Cecil: Sam, are you OK?\n\n Sheriff Sam: [shakily] I\xe2\x80\x99m fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s just we\xe2\x80\x99re getting away from the point. Which is law and order! \n\n Cecil: Yes. And what is the law doing\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Sheriff Sam: And order!\n\n Cecil: Yeah, and-and order going to do about the Glow Cloud? \n\n Sheriff Sam: The Glow Cloud? \n\n Cecil: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the-the crisis that we are facing.\n\n Sheriff Sam: To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really look into all the details before coming over. I\xe2\x80\x99m a person of action, not foresight or insight or any other kind of sight. So what\xe2\x80\x99s all this about a cloud? \n\n Cecil: Uh, uh, I mean look up! \n\n Sheriff Sam: Hmm. Oh! Huh. Well that looks difficult to arrest. I might need to get a special set of handcuffs made. I do like it when I get to look through the handcuff catalogues. It helps me to keep up with all the latest fashions. \n\n Cecil: Well, I mean please hurry Sheriff Sam, because I dunno how long the city is gonna be able to hold out.\n\n Sheriff Sam: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry about this city. Let me worry about this city. You worry about, I dunno whatever you civilians spend your silly days worrying about. The economy or rising sea levels, reality TV programs about cakes, matching socks. Let me handle big stuff like clouds.\n\n Cecil: Excellent. Well, uh, thank you very much, Sheriff Sam.\n\n Sheriff Sam: Thank you Cecil and remember: Law and order!\n\n Cecil: Yes! Law and order, I will remember about those androids.\n\n Sheriff Sam: What? Now, law and order! Lawyers argue with annoying needlessness to despite obviously right deputies explaining reasonably! Thanks, Cecil, and goodbye future possible inmates! \n\n Cecil: Alright, thank you very much Sheriff Sam! And\xe2\x80\xa6 [applause, cheering] Oh yeah, there they go karate chopping anyone that they missed on their way out. Oh, oh no Neil! Ooooh. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Neil. Oh well. \n\n 18. BONUS TRACK: INTERN JEFFREY \n\n Cecil: In the meantime, I think that we need to get a better understanding of why the Glow Cloud seems to be having this adverse effect upon our listeners. Now, probably the best move is to pull up allll of the meteorological records over the past few years, and allll the school board minutes, and then track them against surveillance records of everyone in town over a five-year period. Now, this is going to be a truly tedious and thankless job. So let\xe2\x80\x99s bring on an inteeeern! [applause, cheering]\n\n Intern Jeffrey: Hi boss, I\xe2\x80\x99m your intern, Jeffrey Cranor. \n\n Cecil: Oh, Intern Jeffrey, hello. [cheers] Intern Jeffrey. You must be new.\n\n Jeffrey: I am. Have you noticed that you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly having to hire new interns? \n\n Cecil: Oh yeah, because our interns always die.\n\n Jeffrey: Wait wait. You\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna, you\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna say that live on the air? \n\n Cecil: Oh, well you didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me finish, I was just gonna say that our interns always die eventually. I mean, everybody does.\n\n Jeffrey: Not me.\n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n Jeffrey: I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna die as your intern. See, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to deal with how scary and random the world is.\n\n Cecil: By just accepting it and moving on.\n\n Jeffrey: No, by tinkering with reality til it suits my needs, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Ah!\n\n Jeffrey: Like, I used to be terrified of flying, so so what I did was, I spent decades developing a rudimentary time travel system and then systematically dismantled the chain of events that led to the invention of the airplane. \n\n Cecil: What is airplane? \n\n Jeffrey: Exactly. Of course it-it sort of backfired in this timeline now, because in the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s absence, a significantly less safe form of air travel was invented.\n\n Cecil: Oh, oh oh I get it, so these airplanes are kind of like the big catapult and then cushion system that we have now. \n\n Jeffrey: That seems to be so yeah I was, [chuckles] it is sort of entertaining in this current history that when the Wright brothers were like flung from a three story tall (-), but they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t figured out the cushion part of the system yet. [chuckles] Oh, yeah.\n\n Cecil: Yeah.\n\n Jeffrey: It was an important but messy moment in history. Oh oh and plus, Charles Lindbergh, right, being the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic, that was a far more impressive feat, right, than what he\xe2\x80\x99s currently known for? \n\n Cecil: Oh, of course, you mean the first guy who ever had his big cushion taken away because he was such a big old racist, right? \n\n Jeffrey: Right. [cheeps] Yoink!\n\n Cecil: No ma\xe2\x80\x99am! \n\n Jeffrey: [taps the mic, blows raspberry] Yeah, maybe not such a huge loss.\n\n Cecil: Yeah. So I mean how did you get over your fear of airpines or whatever, and also what other fears did you conquer through the power of time travel?\n\n Jeffrey: I was really afraid of spiders.\n\n Cecil: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re so afraid that if you see one, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna freak out because they\xe2\x80\x99re so cute because they\xe2\x80\x99re just like, [high voice] OMG I love you, and the spider\xe2\x80\x99s like OMG I love youuuuu! Pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling pling! [little voice] I love youuuu. Be a [\xe2\x80\x93].\n\n Jeffrey: Let\xe2\x80\x99s say yes.\n\n Cecil: OK! But wait a minute, spiders are still here, you did not get rid of them.\n\n Jeffrey: No no no, I-I tinkered with my genetics before birth, and I turned myself into a giant spider. \n\n Cecil: Aaaaaah! I was gonna say something about that, because you were totally not a giant spider when you walked in here a few moments ago.\n\n Jeffrey: Ah, technically in this timeline I was, you know it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. My thought process behind doing it was, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of what you are. \n\n Cecil: Mm hm? \n\n Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah. Yeah turns out most people are afraid of what they are, so now I\xe2\x80\x99m also terrified of mirrors and reflective surfaces, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: Oh, o-ho-ho-ho-ho!\n\n Jeffrey: It\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect system, but but! I will use my powers to make my my dying as your intern impossible. \n\n Cecil: Oh, and and and and what is your plan for that? \n\n Jeffrey: [clears throat] I will go back in time.\n\n Cecil: Mm hm.\n\n Jeffrey: And prevent my own existence.\n\n Cecil: What, oh. What? \n\n Jeffrey: See if I never existed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t be an intern and if I can\xe2\x80\x99t be an intern, can\xe2\x80\x99t die as an intern.\n\n Cecil: Y-yeah but could you just like not become an intern to begin wiiith, or or or you could just like walk out of here right now and and and and choose a different career path and never look back.\n\n Jeffrey: [makes noises with his mouth] No, I think time travel\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to be totally sure. \n\n Cecil: Oh, OK. Alright. Oh, oh hey. Before you go, Jeffrey, I have this huge research project, and I know you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna erase yourself from history, but would you mind taking care of this before you go, is that alright?\n\n Jeffrey: Sure, as a matter of fact I just now went back two weeks in time, already finished it, it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting right there on your desk.\n\n Cecil: Oh, oh!\n\n Jeffrey: So now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go back to before I was born and if all goes well, I will never have gone back in time, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t have existed, which I think, I think, technically means I won\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to prevent my existence, which means I\xe2\x80\x99ll reappear here, but then in reappearing I\xe2\x80\x99ll prevent my own existence again and then disappear. You know what, quantum physics just works itself out.\n\n Cecil: Yeah, (it\xe2\x80\x99s on just this). \n\n Jeffrey: Alright, wish me luck boss, goodbye. \n\n Cecil: Alright. Thank you, intern Jeffrey! [applause, cheers]'
