Episode 48 - Renovations
b"True beauty is on the inside, where everything is red, and glistening, and full of practical organs and sharp rocks.\n\n\n Welcome to the Greater Desert Bluffs Metropolitan Area.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Hello, listeners! You look nice today!\n\n\n This is an assumption, but it is a safe assumption. I am positive you look nice.\n\n\n Yes, a very safe assumption! Probably the safest of the many, many assumptions I\xe2\x80\x99ll make today.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good day, Kevin! The company picnic is still going strong! It\xe2\x80\x99s been over two weeks and every resident of Night Vale is\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n And, by extension, every employee of StrexCorp!\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6has been enjoying our first annual company picnic of indeterminate length.\n\n\n So many fun activities, Lauren! Nobody wants to leave!\n\n\n Nobody can leave!\n\n\n But they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\n\n\n Oh, absolutely not! Not with all the fun activities, like work\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Yes!\n\n\n But, there\xe2\x80\x99s even more exciting news! We are renovating this old radio station. We redecorated the studio a couple of weeks back, but now that we have so many new StrexCorp employees arriving each week, we wanted to create a welcoming, work-friendly office for them.\n\n\n Right! It\xe2\x80\x99s always exciting to get a new job! To take on a new career? You know that thrilling moment, after all the resumes and letters and interviews? That moment when one day, a van pulls up next to you, say, just outside your favorite ice cream store or on the sidewalk outside your girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s house, and you are blindfolded and sedated and lightly beaten, and driven around in seemingly random directions, and then after breaking down spiritually, hurled upon the concrete front steps of your new office, ready to start your new career! This is an exciting moment in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s professional life!\n\n\n And here at StrexCorp, we want that excitement to continue. So, we are remodeling and redecorating this old building. We\xe2\x80\x99ve added some new sales offices, a\xe2\x80\xa6a Room of Questioning \xe2\x80\x93 complete with fun steel chairs, and executive restraints\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Mmm!\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6and lots of wonderful framed paintings of human teeth. We\xe2\x80\x99re even completely redoing the bathrooms!\n\n\n Which reminds me, there are some stray cats floating at various heights in the men\xe2\x80\x99s room here at the station. They look to be about a year old. If you want them, come and get them before the demolition crew arrives this afternoon.\n\n\n Good point! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send our producer Daniel in there to take some pictures of the little guys. We\xe2\x80\x99ll post them to the website, and listeners can figure out which ones they want to take, and come and get them.\n\n\n Unfortunately, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s having too much fun at the company picnic!\n\n\n Hmmm.\n\n\n I doubt anyone will have any time \xe2\x80\x93 or the physical ability \xe2\x80\x93 to leave the picnic and adopt a stray floating cat.\n\n\n Oh, too bad! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Daniel post the photos anyway, just so you can all see what you\xe2\x80\x99re missing.\n\n\n Hehe!\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n Thanks, Kevin!\n\n\n Listeners, are you cold? Just a little bit? Feel a thin chill on your skin?\n\n\n Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve wrapped your arms over each other, and you\xe2\x80\x99re rubbing them softly but vigorously?\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re so cold!\n\n\n And now you\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled your arms entirely into your shirt, trying to maximize the body heat of skin contact. You\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled in your arms, and you\xe2\x80\x99re rocking your body forward and back\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n What about your ears and nose? So very, very cold!\n\n\n Ask a friend to borrow a sweater, try that. Go on!\n\n\n No one\xe2\x80\x99s around! Uh-oh! You don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know a single person, do you?\n\n\n Your life may be a total lie.\n\n\n Well, at best a fever dream.\n\n\n Or someone else\xe2\x80\x99s night terror.\n\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s probably it.\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re very cold.\n\n\n And no one to help you. Or hear you.\n\n\n Look around. All gray, windowless walls, right?\n\n\n Not even a door.\n\n\n How much air do you have left? How are you even breathing?\n\n\n There can\xe2\x80\x99t be much air left.\n\n\n This message brought to you by Best Buy.\n\n\n Best Buy. Conserve your oxygen!\n\n\n Listeners, the renovations have brought so much joy here to the radio station that we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d extend the fun throughout the town of Night Vale. We\xe2\x80\x99ve sent our contractors all over the city to tear down other things, too. Like the abandoned missile silo outside of town, several active but low-achieving elementary schools, and that weird forest along the eastern edge of Night Vale.\n\n\n Oh, I know that forest! It\xe2\x80\x99s a really nice forest! It complimented my outfit as I drove past it the other day. It whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cThat vest fits you well, Kevin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n It also whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a clever and colorful fashion sense. You are a delight to be near!\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\n That forest never whispers anything at me.\n\n\n I actually stopped my car along the side of the road, because I was feeling welcomed \xe2\x80\x93 even beckoned \xe2\x80\x93 by such a nice community of trees. But as I approached, it whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Your eyes! No! Please go! Please, leave us be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And I did. Because I have such a healthy respect for nature.\n\n\n I know you do. Vile, vile nature.\n\n\n Anyway, we\xe2\x80\x99re tearing that forest down to build a new corporate training facility!\n\n\n Great!\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve also hired the small civilization living under lane five of the Desert Valley Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex. Since building owner Teddy Williams is\xe2\x80\xa6busy at the company picnic and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid his lease, the small army of tiny people are using the building as a headquarters. They\xe2\x80\x99ve renamed it The Cathedral of Huntokhar, after their god.\n\n\n They\xe2\x80\x99ve also torn down the Arby\xe2\x80\x99s, and put in a contemporary sculpture, which is a 1:1 scale model replica of the Arby\xe2\x80\x99s they just tore down.\n\n\n It feels so good to redecorate.\n\n\n Does it? I rarely feel anything. I rarely feel anything at all.\n\n\n Hmmm.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at financial news!\n\n\n The markets are really fantastic today!\n\n\n Counterpoint? You\xe2\x80\x99re really fantastic today!\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re too kind!\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m kind because everything looks good in the financial markets!\n\n\n Would you be less kind if the markets were doing poorly?\n\n\n I would! Down markets mean people aren\xe2\x80\x99t working hard, and if people aren\xe2\x80\x99t working hard, that must mean they\xe2\x80\x99re sad and lazy! And when people are sad and lazy, I become less kind.\n\n\n Interesting.\n\n\n What are you doing?\n\n\n Hang on\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Listeners, Lauren is doing something on her phone.\n\n\n Annnnd, done. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if that\xe2\x80\xa6yup! Yes, it seems to be! Wonderful!\n\n\n What did you do?\n\n\n I just liquidated nearly all of my domestic stock, and the market is reacting quickly to it. Stock prices are plummeting. The markets are really terrible today.\n\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s awful news! It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame how people just don\xe2\x80\x99t value hard work like they used to. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let your sadness and laziness destroy our economic future! Cheer up!\n\n\n Wow! I think you were wrong. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t become less kind at all!\n\n\n I didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\n\n\n No, you became more helpful.\n\n\n [scoffs] You\xe2\x80\x99re right! Telling sad people to cheer up is like an extra level of kindness!\n\n\n It totally is! That was a very informative financial report we just had. The markets are still terrible now, though. There might have to be layoffs, or\xe2\x80\xa6disappearances, but I think it was worth it.\n\n\n Lauren? I just noticed all these new framed pictures of human teeth on the studio wall!\n\n\n They\xe2\x80\x99re lovely, right?\n\n\n Yes, very! But that one? I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that picture! I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall choosing to put a picture of a lighthouse in my radio studio! I would only choose pleasant images to look at. It is a very unpleasant image!\n\n\n I agree. I do not like it one bit. Let us try, for a moment, not to look at it.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop looking at it!\n\n\n Ugh, me neither! I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Daniel to take care of it when he\xe2\x80\x99s done photographing those doomed floating cats in the bathroom.\n\n\n Good plan!\n\n\n Hmm.\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re receiving word from downtown that there\xe2\x80\x99s a slowdown in our renovations. Our demolition crews have been stalled outside the empty lot across the street from the Rec Center, the lot with the sign that says \xe2\x80\x9cFuture Home of the Old Night Vale Opera House.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n It seems the outgoing mayor of Night Vale, Pamela Winchell, some old lady, and a line of impossibly tall people with long heads and wings have escaped\xe2\x80\xa6or, um\xe2\x80\xa6skipped out early from the company picnic, and are blocking our contractors from building the town\xe2\x80\x99s third Sharper Image!\n\n\n But that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible! We invoked eminent domain.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word that the mayor has veto power over both eminent domain and Sharper Image.\n\n\n How is she still mayor, even? Daniel! Daniel, where are you?\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find Daniel. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have him drive me downtown, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to deal with this directly. I am tired of messing around with\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n [Gasps] What was that?\n\n\n Listeners, the lights just went out in the studio.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6Daniel?\n\n\n Kevin? Why has Daniel not come back from taking pictures of the cats? That should not have taken this long. He\xe2\x80\x99s very efficient.\n\n\n Shhhh! There\xe2\x80\x99s someone here, Lauren! There\xe2\x80\x99s someone else in this room!\n\n\n Listeners, there is a bright, black glowing coming from the middle of our studio. It is glowing around the shape of someone neither man nor woman, tall, long, with great black wings, beating softly through filtered and recirculated 71\xc2\xba air. It is holding something. Something small and round. Listeners, it is holding a light bulb!\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s moving now. The person\xe2\x80\x93 the\xe2\x80\xa6the what? The\xe2\x80\xa6the angel (angels are, of course, real and very dangerous). This dangerous being is walking to the wall, to that new piece of art. The art that, unlike any other art in history, is not depicting teeth.\n\n\n Oh, Smiling God! That picture! Kevin, that picture, it's\xe2\x80\x93 It\xe2\x80\x99s different now.\n\n\n The lighthouse? Moments ago, the picture was of a lighthouse on a desert mountain in the clean light of midday. Now the photo is a lighthouse at desert\xe2\x80\x99s dusk! Purple-orange sky and a blinking red light atop the mountain. The light in the photo is actually blinking!\n\n\n There is a door at the foot of the stone tower, and that door is opening. A deep, purple glow slowly silhouetting a man \xe2\x80\x93 it looks like a man. I cannot tell if he is tall or if he is short. He is holding something. I cannot tell what it is, but it moves in his arms.\n\n\n\n\n [A faint but familiar note starts welling in the background]\n\n\n\n\n The man is\xe2\x80\x93 he is entering the lighthouse! He\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Kevin, the door! Our studio door.\n\n\n Daniel! Is that you? Are the kittens dealt with?\n\n\n I see only the intruder\xe2\x80\x99s shadow, in that deep purple glow. It is\xe2\x80\x93 it is the man from the lighthouse! He is holding something!\n\n\n\n\n [A familiar drum beat begins to play]\n\n\n\n\n The dangerous, dangerous angel is with him! The man is holding something!\n\n\n No! How did you\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n He is holding\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n\n\n [Music crescendos]\n\n\n\n\n Don\xe2\x80\x99t come any nearer!\n\n\n He is holding a cat.\n\n\n\n\n [Welcome to Night Vale theme plays, with a bit of extra bass]\n\n\n Thank you for bringing me here, Erika.\n\n\n And while whatever happens next, happens, I take you, Night Vale, to the weather!\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cHigh Tide Rising\xe2\x80\x9d by Fox]\n\n\n Listeners, it is good to be back. After so long away, in such a terrible, terrible place. Let us never fall again for the wicked ruse of the company picnic. No matter how many badminton tournaments or chili cook-offs the fliers and masked Picnic Captains advertise.\n\n\n There was one escape attempt during the unending, deadly horror that was the staff softball game. Ugh! Mmm. But\xe2\x80\xa6there were helicopters everywhere, and we were captured trying to dig a tunnel under second base with staple pullers.\n\n\n But, last night, just when \xe2\x80\x93 as all picnic-goers eventually do \xe2\x80\x93 we had given up all hope of someday being free, former intern Dana appeared to me. There was an old oak door, which I swear had not been in the heavily-electrified volleyball nets before \xe2\x80\x93 or, no. No. No more euphemisms. No more talking around it. They were high voltage electric fences, fatal to any who touched them.\n\n\n The door in the fence opened, and she stepped out and, taking me by my hand, led me with her into whatever strange other world she has been trapped in for so long.\n\n\n She brought me to the lighthouse in her strange desert that is like our own, but is not our own. She introduced me to an army of men and women who have taken great care of her. And introduced me to several tall, winged creatures, each named Erika. With a K.\n\n\n Dana said they were angels. Heh. I informed each of them that angels are not real, and that\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous! I might have howled this while covering my eyes.\n\n\n Dana took me to the peak of the mountain \xe2\x80\x93 which is also not real. From atop this monstrosity of rock and earth and lies, we looked out across an empty, pink desert. Past the lighthouse, over the army, to a curved horizon under a placid ocean of cloudless forever.\n\n\n And I saw for myself, on that horizon, the terrible light rushing toward us.\n\n\n Former intern Maureen is the one who showed everyone it was possible to pass fully back and forth, with her disappearing and reappearing. And it was John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer \xe2\x80\x93 who stumbled on how to open the old oak doors that lead to so many places\xe2\x80\xa6but also to here. This one beautiful place in space and time. Old Woman Josie and her definitely-not-angelic companions are in that other world, too.\n\n\n So many have fled. But we will not flee anymore.\n\n\n I have returned Khoshekh to his home here at the station, floating four feet off the ground in the men\xe2\x80\x99s restroom. I found StrexCorp\xe2\x80\x99s former radio producer Daniel, lying dead \xe2\x80\x93 or\xe2\x80\xa6perhaps inoperative (I do not know if Daniel identified as organic or not) \xe2\x80\x93 outside the restrooms. Apparently no one ever told him the deadly consequences of taking photos of cats.\n\n\n Listeners? All is not well. Most is not well. StrexCorp still owns all that can be owned here. And so much also that cannot be owned. Many of you are still trapped in the company picnic.\n\n\n Others of you are trapped in mistaken impressions of how your life should supposedly be, but that started long before this whole Strex thing. That\xe2\x80\x99s something only you can fix, through reflection, and laughter, and acceptance.\n\n\n Lauren and Kevin ran away when faced with whatever you call Erika, but I do not think they will be gone for long.\n\n\n And then there is Dana, and her army of masked warriors, standing in the path of that deep, rumbling light. That searing, blinding, hum. That Smiling God.\n\n\n And, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where Carlos is. They captured his scientists, but they did not capture him. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is fine. A scientist is always fine.\n\n\n Listeners, so much is wrong. Here is what\xe2\x80\x99s right:\n\n\n Night Vale Community Radio is ours again. We are the only thing in Night Vale not owned by Strex and I swear\xe2\x80\xa6I swear\xe2\x80\xa6we will stay that way.\n\n\n And soon this whole town will be as this station is now. Not without struggle, not without loss. Not without grave injury and a lifetime of what-ifs. But we will do it.\n\n\n We may be controlled by the City Council, and the Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency, and chemtrails, and the Secret Order of Reptile Kings, and the mysterious lights that hover above us, but we will not be controlled by a Smiling God! We are Night Vale! And we are, in our own way, free!\n\n\n We must continue to fight, and resist. We must be the heroes we look for in others. We must no longer speak in code, but in action.\n\n\n Return to your homes, if you can. But do not lock your doors tonight. Do not hide yourselves away from danger. Be brave. Be truly brave.\n\n\n I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t get carried away. Stay out of the Dog Park. And don\xe2\x80\x99t run with knives. And, for crying out loud, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry out loud. You\xe2\x80\x99ll upset the bears, which are emotionally fragile animals that are already very uncomfortable with themselves.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for that nagging feeling that you left the coffee pot on. Surely it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal, but\xe2\x80\xa6oh, geez! What if it is a big deal? Oh, no! I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you left the coffee pot on!\n\n\n And as always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight!\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Feeling lost? Like you have no goal in life? Like you\xe2\x80\x99re covered in dirt and wet leaves? Like you\xe2\x80\x99re an earthworm? Are you an earthworm? Kinda sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re an earthworm, actually."
