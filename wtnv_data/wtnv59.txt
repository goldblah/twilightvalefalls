Episode 53 - The September Monologues
b'Cecil: The wind out of the desert is changing. I feel it. You feel it. A shiver in the midday heat. A crackle in the television broadcast. A shift in your immune system.\n\n\n It is September, and something is different.\n\n\n It is September, and the days have gone sinister \xe2\x80\x93 from first eye\xe2\x80\x99s open to last slow breathing.\n\n\n It is September, and so, listeners \xe2\x80\x93 dear listeners \xe2\x80\x93 Night Vale Public Radio is proud to introduce The September Monologues. \n\n\n Faceless Old Woman: Chad? Can you hear me? My mouth is half an inch from your left ear and I\xe2\x80\x99m whispering. You will feel a heavy warmth there, like air from the swamp. That means I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you, Chad. I\xe2\x80\x99m right behind you.\n\n\n Listen, Chad\xe2\x80\xa6how long have we lived together? Your whole life, that\xe2\x80\x99s the answer. Not that you\xe2\x80\x99d know it, because I do it secretly. That\xe2\x80\x99s my name: the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home. Though, also, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a face.\n\n\n Chad, I am getting away from the point. You are the point.\n\n\n Is this how you want to live your life? Shuffling from one trivial moment to the next, never letting anything add up to anything else?\n\n\n Chad, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my place to say, I know. My place is hiding behind the boring button-up shirts in your closet, my thin, gnarled fingers almost brushing your hand each time you reach for one of those milquetoast frocks on your way to another unsuccessful night trying to find someone who will make you more than you are.\n\n\n Chad, do you know how many flies live in your apartment? I do. I know all of their names, and I tell them where to lay their eggs. So listen, Chad, do not get on my wrong side. My fury is vast, and murky, and expressed through a papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 gape-mouthed that I left behind your cereal boxes this morning. Not that you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it. You never eat breakfast. A good breakfast is the start of a good day, say the tablets we found in that ancient crater last year.\n\n\n But I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to lecture you, Chad. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to understand. Like, what\xe2\x80\x99s with all the candles? Your room is strewn with clothes like your dresser got sick from overeating, but suddenly you\xe2\x80\x99re buying nicely-scented candles, and arranging them carefully in the living room? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like you, Chad.\n\n\n And the fabric. That rich, red fabric that you bought and\xe2\x80\xa6are you sewing that fabric, Chad? That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like you either. Your other hobbies involve watching or consuming and now, here you are, doing! What does it mean?\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve uncovered many secrets, Chad. Do not think that you are going to be able to keep anything from me. I know what is behind the old VHS copy of Cliffhanger in your media center. I know about the way you talk to your horse figurines.\n\n\n Yes, I know about the horse figurines.\n\n\n And I know about the dreams, Chad. I put my faceless head very close to your face at night as you sleep. If you opened your eyes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would upset you.\n\n\n So fragile, and yet so certain \xe2\x80\x93 your belief in the sanctity and privacy of home.\n\n\n Oh, what about the amulet you hid in the bag of lettuce deep in your fridge? Why the amulet, that ancient cracked painting of a screaming goat set upon gold and ebony? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lift it, Chad. I tried with my bony, skin-taut arms that have a surprising animal strength. Those arms that have been so close to you so many times, but that you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen. I tried to lift it, Chad, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I able to lift it?\n\n\n This is me, as a part of your life, trying to understand that life. And you, drinking beer with your friends, drinking beer by yourself, drinking beer before work by yourself, smiling with your friends and smiling at your work and sitting dead-eyed and silent for hours inside your living room, wearing a polo shirt and khaki shorts, crying without making a sound or moving. A silence of tears down your slack, boyish face.\n\n\n Chad, this is you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped googling bees and I\xe2\x80\x99ve started googling your name over and over. I can\xe2\x80\x99t find a trace of you anywhere. What are you, Chad? I thought I understood. I do not understand.\n\n\n And now, you are rising from your easy chair, still weeping. You are putting on a long red robe and lighting the candles arranged through the room in a pattern or a shape that I do not recognize. You are raising up the amulet and you are speaking\xe2\x80\xa6no, shouting, no\xe2\x80\xa6intoning.\n\n\n This is not a language I understand! I understand every language. Your very speech is outside of my reality.\n\n\n What I saw next, Chad, was beyond me. I have seen death in its many heaving forms. I have seen the low-flying ships that hide on the horizon in front of the setting sun, and I have seen the misshapen silhouettes of their pilots. I have seen the websites you visit.\n\n\n But Chad\xe2\x80\xa6what I saw in that moment, what you summoned in your living room, what you brought to us here in this little town, my town, the town I secretly live in, the town in which I am, at least in my view, presumptive mayor\xe2\x80\xa6what have you done?\n\n\n Chad, this is all to say that I am the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, but\xe2\x80\xa6not your home, Chad. Not anymore. Because something else is living there now.\n\n\n Oh, Chad. Something else is living there now.\n\n\n Cecil: The air is different. Or\xe2\x80\xa6no. It is the way we are breathing that is different. The breathers, all of us, have changed. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone funny, you know, just\xe2\x80\xa6funny. Words can\xe2\x80\x99t capture it. But I have only words.\n\n\n So, up next, more words. After that, words. Words, and words, and words. Words that form The September Monologues.\n\n\n Michelle Nguyen: Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s made a good album in years! \xe2\x80\x9cMichelle,\xe2\x80\x9d you say, \xe2\x80\x9cMichelle Nguyen, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Very little of what I have to say is true. Some of it is, though. Make of that what you will.\n\n\n No, don\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust you to make anything good.\n\n\n Hang on, there\xe2\x80\x99s a customer.\n\n\n Welcome to Dark Owl Records!\n\n\n You! You! Why are you here? What do you want from me, you\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Never mind, they left.\n\n\n We sold a pretty decent record the other day. It was a Beach Boys album. Everyone thinks the Beach Boys are the best. And fine, fine, they contributed a lot to American music. You can hear their influence on people like Cole Porter, and Joni Mitchell, and Mozart, but I\xe2\x80\x99m so sick of everybody thinking they know music just because they buy a Beach Boys album!\n\n\n I begged the guy not to buy it. It was, of course, the one with most of their big hits on it, like \xe2\x80\x9cThe People Under the Floor,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Being Followed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTracking Device Inside My Skin,\xe2\x80\x9d and no doubt the Beach Boys\xe2\x80\x99 most famous song, \xe2\x80\x9cHand Me That Hammer, Madame Dentist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n He bought the album anyway, but I broke it into pieces as I handed it to him, and then I told him the store was closed and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to leave. He\xe2\x80\x99s still somewhere in the basement. A couple people came looking for him, but I covered my eyes with my hand and sat silently so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see me.\n\n\n Point being, there are still a few good albums in the world, but not many.\n\n\n Oh! You know what I ordered for the store last week? It should arrive any day. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a true lover of folk music, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be just as excited as I am for this. I ordered 25 copies of Woody Guthrie. They\xe2\x80\x99re scale replicas of his body in his most recognizable pose: holding a guitar in one hand and an aquarium full of mice in his other two hands. These replicas are 3:1 scale, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no room with our low ceilings. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to keep them outside of the store in people\xe2\x80\x99s lawns and next to highway overpasses and such. But they\xe2\x80\x99re just great!\n\n\n Oh, wait. Never mind. Folk music is over. It\xe2\x80\x99s done, came and went. Stop listening to folk music! The Guthrie replicas are now 70% off. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t buy them, though. Folk music is dead.\n\n\n You want to know what music I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to right now? Joy Division. Not \xe2\x80\x9cUnknown Pleasures.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s listened to that album. That album will never be talked about by me again. No. I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to a different Joy Division album. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty recent album that was never actually released, because they never wrote it or recorded it or produced it. But I managed to get a copy of this album, and I listen to it almost daily. In private, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not ruined by other people having heard it or talked to me about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good album. I cry when I hear it. I cry when I think about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m crying now.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound to you like I\xe2\x80\x99m crying, because you can\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend my crying. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see me or hear me crying because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t truly know me. This Joy Division album truly knows me in a way no other human ever has.\n\n\n And so, that\xe2\x80\x99s a complete list of music I like.\n\n\n Looks like the coroner is here again.\n\n\n Hello, Linda! We got the new Panic! at the Disco album in!\n\n\n [whispers] I\xe2\x80\x99ve been selling her blank CDs for years now and telling her that\xe2\x80\x99s Panic! at the Disco\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic, that they just release completely silent songs with no titles on albums with no tracks or cover art and no name. It\xe2\x80\x99s really funny, except for, their new album really did come out and it\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cQuit Fabricating Our Musical Career, Michelle,\xe2\x80\x9d so I\xe2\x80\x99m a little freaked out by that. But also, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m really impacting the future of music. [end whispering]\n\n\n We here at Dark Owl Records pride ourselves on that: impacting the future of music. Also, the past. We impact the past in music.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing a hat right now! So, know that.\n\n\n I hate Panic! at the Disco. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually heard their music, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually hate them so much as resent them. Or rather, resent what they stand for. Or rather, resent what I believe that they stand for. Or rather, resent my perception of other people\xe2\x80\x99s projections of what they stand for. Or rather, myself.\n\n\n I hate myself, is what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say.\n\n\n We have that in common, I think!\n\n\n Panic! at the Disco is probably fine if you were to ever listen to their music. Lots of people buy lots of their music. Of course, lots of people buy lots of ridiculous things: overpriced coffee, minivans, dogs, furniture, towels, medicine\xe2\x80\xa6you name it, and some idiot will buy it.\n\n\n Linda! Is that a Public Enemy cassette? Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch that! You do not have hip hop access here!\n\n\n We have a pretty good hip hop collection. Mmmm\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that one cassette. And it\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\n\n\n Anyway, t-shirts and posters and trance music are all 50% off this weekend at Dark Owl, so come visit the store.\n\n\n Wait\xe2\x80\xa6never mind. We\xe2\x80\x99re closed until further notice.\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed in here anyway. Not with that tattoo. Who has a Woody Guthrie tattoo these days?\n\n\n Cecil: It will all be over soon. And then, something else will take its place.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLike waves,\xe2\x80\x9d says the common metaphor.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFrom dust to dust,\xe2\x80\x9d says a simplified version of a complicated philosophy.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMmmmmmmm, zmmmmmmm,\xe2\x80\x9d says the big bang, still echoing quietly through everything it created.\n\n\n Let us return, one last time \xe2\x80\x93 before it, you, or anything else ends \xe2\x80\x93 to The September Monologues.\n\n\n Steve Carlsberg: There are glowing arrows in the sky. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see them. I do.\n\n\n There are dotted lines and arrows and circles. The sky is a chart that explains the entire world. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it. I know that.\n\n\n The world makes sense. I\xe2\x80\x93 I believe that. I\xe2\x80\x93 I do. It has to. Otherwise\xe2\x80\xa6it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense! And that would be the worst thing that could possibly happen.\n\n\n No one listens when I talk. They hear, but\xe2\x80\xa6they don\xe2\x80\x99t listen. Even now, maybe your attention is drifting. Why pay attention to me? Why pay attention to Steve Carlsberg? \xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes again, with his theories and explanations.\xe2\x80\x9d But I see them! I see the arrows in the sky. I understand what is happening.\n\n\n Night Vale is a weird place. No one else sees that, I guess. But I do. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like other places. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been other places, but I know. I know what other places are like. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read books. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, please. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read books. I have to maintain my position and the respect of my peers. I\xe2\x80\x99m a member in good standing of the PTA. I bring scones and they are always the first item in the pot luck to go. I take great pride in that.\n\n\n My\xe2\x80\xa6uh, brother-in-law, step-brother, brother-outside-of-the-law\xe2\x80\xa6I can never get those terms straight. Well, he just brings store-made hummus and wheat-free pita chips. Every time! I make my scones with my own hands, from scratch. Sometimes, I put in the zest of orange, sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t. They are not always the same.\n\n\n Nothing is.\n\n\n People pick at the chips and hummus. They want to be polite. Often, they are not. We all, all of us, so often fail at what we want to do. That\xe2\x80\x99s OK, as long as we understand our failure. As long as we see it. I see my failure to help my community the way I would like to help it. I would like to guide it somewhere new, but the only person who listened to me was that man on the Desert Bluffs radio. And then\xe2\x80\xa6well, then all the rest happened.\n\n\n The world would be better if more people saw the dotted lines and arrows in the sky. I can look out my window and see them! I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that now.\n\n\n Listen, I love my wife, and she loves her brother. And we both love our daughter, and my\xe2\x80\xa6brother-in-law? Half-brother? Double-brother? Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6Well, he loves his niece. So that counts for a lot. That counts for most of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate him the way he hates me. How could I? I understand him. He hates me because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand me at all. Cannot see the dotted lines. He cannot see the arrows.\n\n\n I first met him at the wedding. He\xe2\x80\x99s busy, or he says he is. He does always seem to be at the station. Or at least, he used to be. This last year\xe2\x80\x99s been good for him, I think. It has softened him a little, in the right places. Although not at all toward me. But I never expect that.\n\n\n He was very nice when I first met him. \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to the wedding,\xe2\x80\x9d he said grandly. Which was odd, since he actually arrived after me. But it was a nice gesture anyway, and I accepted it with a handshake and a \xe2\x80\x9cHello! It\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, try a scone!\xe2\x80\x9d I had made scones. It seemed right, in the midst of a formal celebration like that, to have a little touch of home, to remind people of the lifetime of simple gestures that this grand celebration was meant to launch.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is just scrumptious! This is the best scone I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything like that in some time.\n\n\n We chatted for a while. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what about. Maybe the weather.\n\n\n No, definitely the weather. I remember it was the weather, because we had to stand in awkward silence for a bit as we waited for the music to stop playing.\n\n\n But then, it all turned. \xe2\x80\x9cHow \xe2\x80\x98bout those secret agents?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, indicating the black-suited women and men lining the back of the room, taking photos and writing down everything that everyone said.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAah,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, well\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n He was raised in the Night Vale tradition of silence. And with a belief in the power of hierarchy and bureaucracy. I had been raised that way too, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick. Because I could see the arrows, and the dotted lines, and the circles laid out across the world. I could clearly see how things were! The way that it was all organized, and for whose benefit.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose agents from\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh. Well, um, this next part is complicated. People always just refer to them from being from a Vague, Yet Menacing Agency and\xe2\x80\xa6while they are certainly menacing, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing vague about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I explained to Cecil then exactly what branch they\xe2\x80\x99re from, who specifically they report to, and whose desk those reports ultimately land on. People could die for knowing these things. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known it. I could always just see it, how it all really was laid out.\n\n\n And as I talked, Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s face changed. It twisted into a grimace.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have you teaching Janice lies like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he howled. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for using such a melodramatic verb, but he really did. He howled! And then he refused to speak to me again.\n\n\n During the ceremony, he tried to object on the grounds that I knew and spoke aloud forbidden knowledge and dangerous truths. Which is actually a mandatory reason to cancel a wedding according to the laws of Night Vale, but his sister talked him down.\n\n\n Since then, though, he\xe2\x80\x99s never trusted me. It\xe2\x80\x99s because of Janice. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I want Janice to understand the world the way I do. I want her to see the arrows and dotted lines, to know the world, not just repeat what has been told to her.\n\n\n My brother-in-law, as you might imaging, disagrees. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will learn only what she is allowed to learn in schools!\xe2\x80\x9d he explains to me regularly, and loudly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t poison her with education!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s right. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like knowing has made my life easier. Quite the opposite.\n\n\n Quite the opposite.\n\n\n But every time I look up, I see them. Glowing arrows in the sky, dotted lines and circles, a great chart that explains it all, and I ask you, how can I know all of this? How can I understand, and not try to explain? How can I see the dotted lines so bright and tangible, and deny them?\n\n\n I have to try, even if it means that everyone \xe2\x80\x93 even my wife, or even Janice \xe2\x80\x93 grows to hate me. The truth is more important than all that. It has to be.\n\n\n Or else, why would it shine so clear above?\n\n\n Cecil: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s it for The September Monologues. We\xe2\x80\x99ve said so much. What more is there to say?\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: [static sounds]'
