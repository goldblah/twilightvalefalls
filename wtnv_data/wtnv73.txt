The Librarian - Live at Skirball
b"Cecil: If wishes were horses,those wishes would all run away, shrieking and bucking, terrified of a great unseen evil.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Construction crews are on hand at theNight Vale Public Library today to begin the renovations that were\napproved last year by the City Council. Some of the improvements\nplanned for the library are a new children\xe2\x80\x99s wing, something called a\n\xe2\x80\x9cknife pit,\xe2\x80\x9d an upgraded computer room with several empty desks\nand a loudspeaker that repeats \xe2\x80\x9cTechnology ruins lives!\xe2\x80\x9d and,\nmost importantly, thicker plexiglass to protect citizens form the\nlibrarians who were previously allowed to roam freely throughout the\nbuilding.\n\n City Council said renovations have been\ndelayed for several months because it has been difficult to find\nconstruction crews willing to work in such dangerous proximity to\nlibrarians. But they finally found a very talented and brave crew to\nconduct this project: Colston Contractors, Inc. The City Council is\nasking that no one mention to any of the Colston workers that they\nare working near librarians. They think that they\xe2\x80\x99re building an\nelaborate new Pinkberry.\n\n The City Council then added,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesssssss,\xe2\x80\x9d and then they released a bunch of badgers\ninto City Hall \xe2\x80\x93 much to the delight of onlookers who thought that\nthe badgers were kittens. The onlookers were quickly and painfully\ncorrected in this matter.\n\n More on this story as it develops but\nfirst, today\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes.\n\n Aries: Aries, you have much in common\nwith a tree. A sadness that no one can see, or understand.\nCommunication only through silence and wind. Skin made of wood. The\nway you collect sustenance through roots buried in soil. You are\nvery, very much like a tree.\nAlmost impossible to tell the difference.\n\n Taurus: Taurus,\ntoday is the day that you change everything. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\nmisspoke, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Uh, let me try that again, OK? *Ahem*\nToday is the day that everything changes you. You will be completely\nunrecognizable. Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. There ya go.\n\n Gemini:\nHow scared are you of centipedes, Gemini? I mean, no reason. The\nstars are just asking. Like, are you super super\nscared, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure, but you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty brave, right?\nLike, you could handle a couple of centipedes! You could handle a\nbunch of centipedes!\nRight, Gemini? No reason. I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\n\n Cancer:\nToday is an excellent day for you to demand a promotion, to approach\nthe one that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been secretly thinking about for years, to try\nyour hand at that new hobby that you are considering. Unfortunately,\nit is a terrible day\nfor getting that promotion, having that person say yes, and not\ninjuring yourself badly on a power sander. But you should at least\nfeel great about the attempt.\n\n Leo: There\xe2\x80\x99s just a\nthick, green smudge here, and the word \xe2\x80\x9ccryptotoxicology.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\nguess that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, right?\n\n Virgo: Now, wait.\nThere are still some of you left? How did you survive the great\nculling of Virgos that swept through \xe2\x80\x93 oh! You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x98til next week. Sorry, I got confused there.\nOh, yeah, today looks very good for you, Virgo! Maybe use this lovely\nday to get all your affairs in order. Just a thought.\n\n Libra:\nAll your dreams will come true today. Or\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, one of them will.\nYou know that recurring dream where you\xe2\x80\x99re chased through a house\nthat seems like your own, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite, by a swarm of bees that\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t see even though you totally know that they\xe2\x80\x99re there? Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not that recurring dream, it\xe2\x80\x99s the other one. And I am so, so\nsorry.\n\n Scorpio: Your arms\nlook weird. And your face is a natural irritant. And your personality\nleaves much to be desired, the principal desire being your immediate\nabsence. You disgust me, Steve Carlsbe\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, Scorpios? Ugh.\nScorpios, right?\n\n Sagittarius: Buy a\ntourniquet. The best that money can buy.\n\n Capricorn: Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nlucky number is imaginary! But, coincidentally, so are you, and your\nentire experience of the world.\n\n Aquarius: You wanna\nmake some money fast? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, rob somebody. Commit fraud.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots of ways.\n\n Pieces: You\xe2\x80\x99ve just\nwon another brand new car! You stare bleakly at your home filled with\nstacks upon stacks of new cars, occupying every possible space at\nimpossible angles. Today\xe2\x80\x99s brand new car is wheeled in and as you\nfeel its bulk pressing up against you, taking the last bit of your\nhome that had still been yours to live in, you feel tears hot upon\nyour cheeks. Congratulations on your prize!\n\n Listeners, I have\njust received word that there has been an accident at the library.\nThe intricate papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 and balsa wood scaffolding has\ncollapsed. The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police have reported no serious\ninjuries from the accident, but they are saying that one of the dense\ntitanium and heavily-electrified cages containing a librarian was\ndamaged, and that that cage is now empty.\n\n Night Vale, this is\nterrible news. There is a librarian on the loose in our city. And\nNight Vale, there is no triple-thick armored wall or bloody animal\ncarcass lying over a bamboo covered pit of sharp sticks to protect us\nfrom this stalking oblivion. Without the military grade steel walls\nof the library to keep the librarians contained, Night Vale, we are\nhelpless! We are doomed.\n\n Watch your back,\nNight Vale.\n\n Oh! I almost\nforgot. We have a new intern, and that\xe2\x80\x99s always fun! So, let\xe2\x80\x99s have\nhim introduce himself on the air.\n\n Intern Andrew:\nHello, I\xe2\x80\x99m intern Andrew WK. Super excited about being here. Was a\nlong waiting list when I signed up, had to wait, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, three\ndays until the other interns had\xe2\x80\xa6left the station, but my name is\nup on top now!\n\n Cecil:\nYeah! Well, we are just thrilled to have you here.\n\n Andrew:\nI look forward to a long and healthy life in radio.\n\n Cecil:\nSay, um, Andrew, what do you know about librarians?\n\n Andrew:\nLibrarians\xe2\x80\xa6oh no. When I was young, my mother used to work in the\ncoal mines before they were converted into the holding pens that they\nare for those who vote incorrectly in the municipal elections. She\nwent out to work each day, miner\xe2\x80\x99s helmet under her arm, pig slung\nover one shoulder, fencing sword tucked into her belt, and bloodied\naxe across her back \xe2\x80\x93 the usual miner\xe2\x80\x99s get-up \xe2\x80\x93 and she would\ndescend into the dark with her fellow workers seeking out coal or the\ntiny valuable hearts of rare bats.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, so fantastic! What I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna need you to do\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Andrew:\nMy mother saw terrible things down there in the dark. Hazy, feathered\nthings swarming, weeping things. Gawping, gasping things with claws\nand spokes and stingers and more claws! Day in and day out, this was\nher job! Mining coal and fighting the denzions [sic]\nof the dark downwards for their hearts. When she came home she\xe2\x80\x99d be\ncovered in coal dust and lymph.\n\n My mother was never\nafraid, though. Nothing phased her. Except for the day I had to get a\nbook from the library for a school science project. She insisted on\ngoing ahead of me to clear the way, but after a few minutes she came\nout shaking, pale, her fencing sword all bent, her axe broken in\nhalf. \xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Librarians are\nfeared even by the fearless.\n\n But I did get a B\non the project!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s good! And\xe2\x80\x93 and that was a very well-told story. Um,\nalso, I need you just to\xe2\x80\xa6run on down to the library, and just do a\nlittle bit of research on librarians.\n\n Andrew:\nTo the library.\n\n Cecil:\nYeah! Yeah, good luck. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine! Yeah. Well, I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear what intern Andrew comes up with!\n\n Listeners, we are\nalready getting reports from all over town about the escaped\nlibrarian. Liesel Schmidd, who owns the auto body shop near Somerset\nand Gray said she heard whispers. And the whispers sounded as if they\nwere coming from just next to her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you live, Liesel? Do you\nlike cars? How many cars will you fix before you die? What is your\nfavorite color of paint? Do you know what I look like, Liesel? Do you\nwant to? Do you want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And the whispers\nechoed off the closed garage doors of the vast, empty workshop. And\nLiesel said with each question, a halogen work light would fade to\nblack, her auto body shop slowly darkening until the whispers were\nall she could see. And yes, somehow she could see them. Until the\nfinal question.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLiesel! Can I come live with you?\nI am all alone, Liesel!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And the last light\nexploded, and the room went black. And before she could even start\nthe usual process of panic, Liesel felt \xe2\x80\x93 and here she is, alone,\nin the dark \xe2\x80\x93 a small hand slide, slowly, into her own. And Liesel\ntried to pull away, but this childlike hand kept sliding further and\nfurther into her palm, and the childlike hand was thick, serpentine,\nenlarging continually and wrapping around her wrist and then her\nforearm, and she felt the sharp pierce of what seemed like blades,\nbut were likely just the rigid caudal spine common on most\nlibrarians.\n\n And Liesel tried to\nscream, but she could only gasp. And she gasped through a clenched\nthroat and bared teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease! Please, let me be! I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\nhave a family!\xe2\x80\x9d And it was the possession of this family that saved\nher, as her business partner and sister, Pica, having just arrived,\nfired a blowtorch at the book-loving monster, and it slitheringly\nscurried and scurriedly slithered away.\n\n Listeners, I have\nalso received word from Green Market Board president Tristan Cortes\nthat he cannot stop feeling his own heart beating. And he feels it\nthroughout his entire body, and it feels like there is an enormous\nengine buried in the earth beneath him, shaking the very foundations\nof the land, but it is not an enormous engine, it is a heart. And it\nis actually so fragile, and so small, and there is\xe2\x80\xa6something just\non the other side of the front door, he said.\n\n And it is\nbreathing.\n\n And he is\nbreathing.\n\n And he\ncannot bring himself to look outside. He knows who it is. He knows\nwhat it is.\n\n And\nhis heart is reacting as any heart would in the presence of a\nlibrarian, the rhythm of his own liquid life pulses through his\ntongue and his lips, throbbing and impossible to ignore, and he can\nfeel it in his feet as he tries to stand still, and he can feel it in\nhis chest as he tries to yell over the din of his pulse, the BOOM!\nBOOM! BOOM!-ing\nof his heart, and finally he manages one terrified shout into the\ncool morning air. And Tristan could not say for sure that it was a\nlibrarian on the other side of the door, but he did say that he could\nsmell that familiar librarian odor of burnt coffee during a sinus\ninfection.\n\n And he\nalso said that after the beast left, the day\xe2\x80\x99s mail had appeared on\nthe front porch. So\xe2\x80\xa6it could have just been a really\nspooky postal worker.\n\n And now, a word\nfrom our sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is\nbrought to you by American Express. I have with me a representative\nfrom American Express in the studio, here to tell you all about this\namazing card\xe2\x80\x99s many features. The representative is just a slight\nhaze in the air, and her name is Deb!\n\n Deb?\n\n Deb:\nThanks, Cecil.\n\n Hello, listeners\nout there. I think I speak for all American Express employees, and\nalso for all sentient patches of haze, when I say that I am just\nthrilled about the new American Express Obsidian Card.\n\n Cecil:\nOhhh! Well, that sounds very exclusive! I'm\xe2\x80\x93 haha, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually\nstill using the same AMEX that I got in college, um\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just a\nPost-it note, and it has \xe2\x80\x9cReal American Express Card\xe2\x80\x9d written on\nit, and a drawing of a thumbs-up. And I trust this card completely\nalthough, admittedly, I have yet to find a merchant that will\nactually accept it.\n\n Deb:\nWell, the new Obsidian Card will solve all of your problems. It\xe2\x80\x99s\naccepted worldwide by any merchant that keeps their store dimly lit,\nand lingers sadly all day on memories of lost loved ones. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy \xe2\x80\x93\nif you hear crying, then your card is welcome.\n\n Cecil:\nOh!\n\n Deb:\nAnd the benefits are better than ever! The Obsidian Card features\nfull purchase protection, extended warranty on electronics, a\ndeathless hunger that can never be sated by mere carnal appetite, and\nthe quiet loss of one part of your body every month. We don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\nyou which part. It\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise.\n\n It also gives you\npoints for airlines. Or it points at the nearest airplane if you put\nit on a flat surface, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember which.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, that sounds really great!\n\n Deb:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what it sounds like.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Deb:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s already in your wallet now. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the wallet of all your\nlisteners. It has replaced\nthe wallet of all your listeners. Many objects in their home will now\nbe replaced by the American Express Obsidian Card. Everything they\ntouch will turn into a black volcanic stone credit card. They will\naccidentally kill people. People they care about. And whose only\ncrime was being touched by the cursed listener.\n\n American Express.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave home.\n\n Cecil:\nWow! What a great product and/or service! You know, I try not to\nlisten to or remember what anybody says to me? Taking in knowledge\ncan be a super dangerous thing to do.\n\n Speaking of danger,\nthe librarian was just seen near the Dog Park. The long-taloned\ncreature with its many round black eyes and hairy brown teeth was\nseen scaling the Dog Park fence. City Council has warned us many\ntimes that the Dog Park is off limits, that dogs are not allowed in\nthe Dog Park. That people are not allowed in the Dog Park. That we\nmay see Hooded Figures in the Dog Park.\n\n Well, witnesses\nsaid that as the librarian approached the Dog Park fence, the Hooded\nFigures all ran away, in different directions, their cloaks\nfluttering in a wind of motion, revealing matching black and white\nNike tennis shoes.\n\n But,\nbefore the librarian could enter the Dog Park, a small band of masked\nchildren showed up, holding slingshots and well-worn copies of Chinua\nAchebe\xe2\x80\x99s critically-acclaimed post-fatalist novel No\nLonger at Ease. By\nall accounts, this was the same group of fifth through eighth graders\nwho bravely escaped last year\xe2\x80\x99s Summer Reading Program at the Night\nVale Public Library.\n\n The leader of that\nescape, 13 year-old Tamika Flynn, was with the group of kids at the\nDog Park trying to back the librarian down from the fence. As a small\nboy blew a low, long tone on a conch shell, Tamika held aloft the\nsevered head of the librarian she defeated last summer (still\nsurprisingly well preserved) as a gruesome warning for the librarian\ncurrently terrorizing the forbidden municipal park.\n\n Witnesses said that\nthe librarian shrieked meekly, and leapt form the fence as the\nchildren chased after it shouting suggested additions to the\nlibrary\xe2\x80\x99s fiction stock.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaxine\nHong Kingston!\xe2\x80\x9d\ncame one shout.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLarry\nMcMurtry\nis a cornerstone of\nnew western literature!\xe2\x80\x9d came another cry.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave never read Elizabeth\nBarrett Browning,\nI hope you add her!\xe2\x80\x9d came a final call as slingshotted rockes\nplunked hard off the retreating librarian\xe2\x80\x99s exoskeleton.\n\n Tamika then spoke.\nWe have her actual speech, because we are all being recorded at all\ntimes by several different organizations, and of course, amateur\ncommunity spying clubs. Here now is Tamika Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s statement:\n\n Tamika Flynn:\nPeople of Night Vale, we are your children. We are your children who\nsurvived the librarians. We are your children who defeated StrexCorp.\nWe are your children who learned the power of books. The power of\nbooks is that they teach you how to destroy what is, but should not\nbe. The power of books is that they show you what it might be like to\nthink as someone other than this person you are stuck being. The\npower of books is poisonous gases and spring traps.\n\n Nothing\nis more powerful than a book. A larger book is slightly more powerful\nthan a smaller book, because it can also be used to hit your enemies.\nSmaller paperbacks are terrible for that. Take it from me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\ntried. A\nHero of Our Time\nmight be a classic of Russian literature, but it is useless against\nthe hide of a librarian \xe2\x80\x93 even when launched with a homemade book\nlauncher. This is why Vladimir Nabokov\xe2\x80\x99s famous\ntranslation added\nseveral thousand blank pages and a carbon steel bullet-shaped duff\njacket.\n\n But your physical\nstature is unrelated to your strength. You are strong because you are\nmany. You are strong because you are in this together. You are strong\nbecause of that weird rain that gave many of you double-quick hand\ncombat reflexes and seventh eyes. You are strong because, if enough\npeople believe in their own power, even if armed only with mass\nmarket paperbacks, they can bring down not just a librarian, but an\nentire corporatic regime!\n\n As for us, your\narmy of missing children, we are not missing. We are found!\n\n Here\nis our plan, Night Vale. We will give up. We will lay down our arms\nand quit fighting. We will close our eyes and sleep. Yes, that is\nwhat we will do. Once we have crushed every enemy in our path! Once\nwe are victorious and bathed in blood, and placing stickers on\nreading levels far beyond our ages! Reading levels that are yet to be\ndiscovered! Pizza reading rewards in quantities and kinds that are\nunimaginable to the unenlightened!\n\n As Indira Gandhi\nonce said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot shake hands with a mangled fist that has\nbeen chewed up by an unchained librarian.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n You are not alone.\nYou were never alone. We will advance on the librarians together.\nBelieve in us, Night Vale. We will exist either way, but you might as\nwell.\n\n You might as well.\n\n Cecil:\nUnfortunately, witnesses were too shaken to see where the librarian\ndisappeared to.\n\n Listeners, I urge\nyou to follow Tamika\xe2\x80\x99s example of strength and courage. Be brave,\nlike Tamika!\n\n But do so indoors,\nyeah? Keep your homes locked, and listen here for further\ninstructions.\n\n But now, let\xe2\x80\x99s have\na look at the Community Calendar.\n\n This Thursday\nafternoon at the Rec Center is the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police\xe2\x80\x99s\nsemiannual gun buy-back program. If you have an illegal or\nunregistered gun, bring it to the Rec Center, and the Secret Police\nwill buy it from you with full amnesty, no questions asked.\n\n A\nSecret Police representative said it\xe2\x80\x99d be \xe2\x80\x9cespecially\ncool\xe2\x80\x9d if you had\nfully-automatic rifles and some hand grenades. \xe2\x80\x9cLike, really\ncool!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, here eyes\ndarting about, her knuckles rhythmically cracking. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cplease don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this. It\xe2\x80\x99s\ntotally covert.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n There is an event\nthis Thursday night at Dark Owl Records. For more on that, we have\nowner Michele Nguyen on the phone.\n\n Umm, Michelle?\n\n Michelle Nguyen:\nHi, Cecil!\n\n Cecil:\nWelcome to our show, Michelle!\n\n Michelle:\nAm I\xe2\x80\xa6on a podcast?\n\n Cecil:\nNo. This is my radio show.\n\n Michelle:\nOh. Good. Podcasts are dead. I hate podcasts.\n\n Cecil:\nHm. So, Michelle, I got a press release saying that you have a\nspecial event this Thursday at Dark Owl Records.\n\n Michelle:\nI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sent that out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to know about it.\n\n Cecil:\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually say what the event is; it just says \xe2\x80\x9cDark Owl\nRecords, this Thursday night, you probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand and\nprobably won\xe2\x80\x99t be invited.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Michelle:\nSo, this Thursday night, the Dark Owl staff and I are going to try to\ndiscover fire. It\xe2\x80\x99s a private event and I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered them never to\ntell anybody what we find out because if everyone knows how to make\nfire, then everyone will start talking about how to make fire, and\nthen people will be making fire all the time. And suddenly making\nfire won\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything. We will no longer feel what it means to\ncreate flames. We will no longer cry under the glimmering orange lamp\nof nature\xe2\x80\x99s most cruel and useful force.\n\n If\neveryone loves making fire, then how can we truly know what it even\nmeans to feel heat, or light a scented candle, or fry an egg, or take\nrevenge on your own diary?\n\n Cecil:\nNot to be a spoil-sport here, Michelle, um, but fire was discovered a\nlong time ago.\n\n Michelle:\nI know that! Fire\xe2\x80\x99s been around for decades.\nBlah blah blah, history, blah blah. But it\xe2\x80\x99s important that my staff\nand I discover it for ourselves.\n\n Cecil:\nHmm.\n\n Michelle:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like Bono said, moments before he died: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all been a lie,\nand I wish I had been more aware.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nOh. Well, it sounds like a cool event.\n\n Michelle:\nPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin it with adjectives.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, it sounds like an event. Um, Michelle, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve\nheard the news today about the escaped librarian.\n\n Michelle:\nI found out about the escaped librarian years ago, from this\nunderground magazine called F\xc3\xbcte\xc3\xbcr.\n\n Cecil:\nFuteur?\n\n Michelle: F\xc3\xbcte\xc3\xbcr,\nwith two umlauts.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, OK. Well I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of F\xc3\xbcte\xc3\xbcr.\n\n Michelle:\nOf course you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. The only way to get a copy is to walk to the\nmiddle of the Whispering Forest. The trees there will try to lure you\ninto becoming one of them by complementing your outfit and physical\nappearance. But I\xe2\x80\x99m immune to positive feedback. So I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the\nonly people who can walk through there.\n\n My friend Richard\nis a tree there now. He used to intern here.\n\n Cecil:\nYeah!\n\n Michelle:\nHe wanted me to tell you hi, and you have a nice voice.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so nice!\n\n Michelle:\nYou have an OK voice. I guess. Richard\xe2\x80\x99s the one who told me about\nthe magazine. In order to read it you have to climb this one tree,\nthis creepy seeder named Redge, who appreciates my hats way too much.\n\n At the top of Redge\nis a plastic magazine kiosk that\xe2\x80\x99s covered with band stickers and\nmisspelled cuss words. \xc2\xa0F\xc3\xbcte\xc3\xbcr Magazine comes out weekly, and it\ntells you news, all before it happens, insuring that I never have to\nhave my parents or someone over 30 tell me something I didn\xe2\x80\x99t already\nknow.\n\n So, yes. I knew\nabout the escaped librarian well before anyone else.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, what happens? I mean, did F\xc3\xbcte\xc3\xbcr explain how we were able to\nsave our town or if, if\nwe were able to save our town?\n\n Michelle:\nProbably. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very interesting. There was a\nreview of an Amanda Palmer album that comes out in eight years. I\nread that instead.\n\n Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m covered\nin spiders, so\xe2\x80\xa6know that.\n\n Cecil:\nOh my gosh! I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry! Please, go call an exterminator right now!\n\n Michelle:\nNo! The spiders are my outfit, Cecil! I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to kill them!\n\n Cecil:\nOK. Um, well, thank you very much, Michelle.\n\n Uh, listeners, this\nThursday night at Dark Owl Record, Michelle and her staff will try to\ndiscover fire.\n\n Michelle:\nPlease stop knowing this.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, before you go Michelle, do you have any special approaches or\ntechniques you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use to discover fire for yourselves?\n\n Michelle:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to use simple elements, like cigarette lighters and\ngasoline. I gotta go. My hat is crawling down my back.\n\n Cecil:\nOK! Thank you very much, Michelle!\n\n More on the\nCommunity Calendar:\n\n This Friday night,\nall lanes of Route 800 will be shut down in both directions as work\ncrews stand in the middle of the empty, dark highway, repeating\n\xe2\x80\x9cBloody Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d three times, just so we can settle this thing once\nand for all!\n\n Oh! Saturday\nafternoon on the great lawn near City Hall is the annual Children\xe2\x80\x99s\nFair! There will be face painting booths, street food, balloon\nanimals, real animals, hungry animals, feral wild animals that fear\nno humans. Children and adults are prohibited from attending until\nthey get all of these animals under control.\n\n Saturday night is\nthe PTA\xe2\x80\x99s annual fundraiser benefit. With more on that, let\xe2\x80\x99s go now\nto PTA treasurer, Diane Creighton, who is on the phone with us right\nnow.\n\n Uh, Hi, Diane?\n\n Diane?\n\n Steve Carlsberg:\nYeah, hi!\n\n Cecil:\nNo!\n\n Steve:\nYeah, yeah, uh, hi, it\xe2\x80\x99s uh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nNo, no, no, no, no!\n\n Steve:\nDiane couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here, so, you know, uh, so it\xe2\x80\x99s me, Steve\nCarlsberg. Secretary-elect of the Night Vale PTA.\n\n Cecil:\nI was told it would be Diane Creighton!\n\n Steve:\nWell, uh, Diane has a minor case of throat spiders, so she asked me\nto fill in for her.\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she did not, Steve Carlsberg! But fine. Fine. Tell us about\nyour idiotic *ahemmmmm*\xe2\x80\xa6Tell\nus about your fundraiser.\n\n Steve:\nOK! Thank you, Cecil! *Ahem*\nThis\nyear, the Night Vale PTA is raising money to increase the number of\nschool clubs. Studies show that children who get involved in\nextra-curricular organizations \xe2\x80\x93 especially kids who take on\nleadership roles \xe2\x80\x93 are more likely to graduate college! In the\ncoming year, we wanna be able to fund a glee club, a drama club, a\nchess club, a pyrokinesis club, an blood stone circle prayer society,\na speechless debate club, and an armed political insurgency club.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat about a science club?\n\n Steve:\nOh, uh, why would we want a science club?\n\n Cecil:\nBecause science is important, Steve!\nWe need science! Kids should learn science! It helps them\xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x93\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very good for them when they need to\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Steve:\nWha\xe2\x80\x93 Wh\xe2\x80\x93 What does it\xe2\x80\x93 How does it help them, Cecil? What does\nit help them do?\n\n Cecil:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Something. Something good. Science is good. I like\nscience. Science is good for all of us.\n\n Steve:\nAlright, well, most parents don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in science, Cecil, so you\nknow, I\xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0I doubt it would have much support, but tell you what,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, fine. So, when is your stupid *hmmmmmm!!!*\nWhat is your event going to be like?\n\n Steve:\nOh, glad you asked. Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s benefit will feature a seated dinner,\na silent auction, a live auction, a secret underground auction, two\nfake diversionary auctions, and a raffle drawing where we hunt,\ncapture, and clean the winner.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, great. That is all the time we have today\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Steve:\nSorry, Cecil! Cecil, sorry! Can I just add that tickets for the\nbenefit are still available online! Ha-ha-ha! They\xe2\x80\x99re only fifty\ndollars, or you can pay at the door. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be held at the Rec\nCenter. You just go past the auditorium and you look for the door.\n\n \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a door you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before, but you will know it when you see\nit. Go through that door, and then continue through a series of\nincreasingly smaller doors, as it becomes harder and harder to\nsqueeze your shoulders, and then your chest and hips, into the\nincreasingly dark and quiet crawlspace. Then just when you think you\nwill become stuck, you will become stuck. And all will go silent, and\nyou will hear nothing except something feathered, and you will feel\nnothing except something feathered. And you will not be heard from\nagain.\n\n Cecil:\nThat sounds like fun!\n\n Steve:\nIt will be! It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be great! Super blast! Super blast good time!\nHa-ha-ha!\n\n Cecil:\nOK, whatever. You know I was just humming to myself until you stopped\ntalking.\n\n Steve:\nOK, well, can I just say one more thing?\n\n Cecil:\nNo! No, Steve\nCarlsberg, we are done here! Hang up the phone!\n\n Steve:\nOK, ha-ha-ha!\n\n Cecil:\nHmmm. Where were we, listeners? Oh, yes. Community Calendar.\n\n \nSunday morning, the Night Vale Junior League will be opening the one\nhundred year time capsule that was buried there by disgruntled Subway\nemployees all the way back in 1915. And it is just so exciting to see\nwhat kinds of bread and cold cuts that have been buried in that\nlittle cardboard box for an entire century! And we are all certain to\nlearn a lot\xe2\x80\xa6and then forget it, only to have it resurface subtly\ncouched in horrifying Jungian dream imagery for the rest of our\nlives. Because that is how time works, hmm?\n\n \nMonday would like for you to leave it alone. It is not its fault that\nyou are emotionally unprepared for your own professional lives! Mmm,\nmmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.\n\n How\nare you doing right now, dear listeners? No? Are you\xe2\x80\xa6afraid? I\nwould like to tell you that I am not\nafraid. Um, I would like to be strong in the face of imminent death,\nNight Vale. I am, after all, the voice of a community, and I must be\nneutral. Impassive. Just\xe2\x80\xa6simply reporting the news. I would like to\nfeel something resembling confidence.\n\n But,\nI am feeling something resembling petrified terror! I am very similar\nto a scared person. The City Council has just announced that\xe2\x80\xa6dear\nlisteners, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I do not know how to tell you this,\nbut\xe2\x80\xa6the City Council has just announced that all\nof the librarians have escaped.\n\n Night\nVale, we do not yet know how many librarians there are, or what\nexactly they are capable of. We were already too scared to read or\neven think\nabout good literature, and now even our own book-free personal space\nwill be invaded by these monsters!\n\n \nLike the great American writer Mark Twain once said, \xe2\x80\x9cReadin\xe2\x80\x99 is\nhardly worth all this bloodshed. That is why all my novels are wadded\nup candy stall receipts that I leave on park benches. They should\nnever be put in libraries, even after I die \xe2\x80\x93 in the next few\nminutes, at the hands of this drunk Minotaur standin\xe2\x80\x99 in my parlor\nright now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nNow, Mark Twain was wise enough to know that libraries are a bad\nidea. Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call my boyfriend Carlos just to\xe2\x80\xa6just to\nsee what he thinks. I mean, I know, I know, he\xe2\x80\x99s only a scientist,\nbut he might have some good ideas about how to handle these unholy\nbeasts.\n\n Carlos:\nHello?\n\n Cecil:\nHey, Carlos. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s me. I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m calling you from the\nshow.\n\n Carlos:\nOh, hey! Yeah, I was listening earlier, um, but I got distracted\nwith, um, uh, with work\xe2\x80\xa6 Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m standing in front of a row\nof beakers, with different colored liquids, intermittently rubbing my\nchin and writing down long, complex, equations. And there is a giant\ncomputer next to me, too, with several blinking buttons.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re obviously\xe2\x80\xa6hard\xe2\x80\xa6at work. Hard at work. And I\xe2\x80\xa6and I\nreally hate to bother you. No, wait! How are you able to listen to my\nradio show from an alternate desert otherworld?\n\n Carlos:\nOh, I\xe2\x80\xa6I just reprogrammed my phone using some basic scientific\nlaws, and now I can actually livestream your radio station! Yeah,\nso\xe2\x80\xa6so time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work correctly in Night Vale, and it works\nactually even less correctly here, so sometimes I get old broadcasts\nfrom before we met, and once I heard a future broadcast but I turned\nthat off as soon as I realized what was happening, because you know,\nsome thing just aren\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be known.\n\n \nAnyway, so I heard that you announced that there\xe2\x80\x99s a new wing of the\nlibrary opening, that\xe2\x80\x99s exciting!\n\n Cecil:\nNo! No! No, that is not exciting! Well, actually, technically, yes it\nis\nexciting, but it\xe2\x80\x99s like, the horrible\nexciting! There are escaped librarians on the loose and\xe2\x80\xa6listen,\nthis is one of the few times that I am glad that you are in an\nalternate dimension. At least, there, you are safe from bloodthirsty\nlibrarians.\n\n Carlos:\nWhy would we need to be afraid of librarians? Librarians are helpful\nand kind! I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize about all librarians,\nyou know, certainly there are some mean librarians, just as there are\nsome mean people, I mean\xe2\x80\xa6just as there are helpful and kind\nlibrarians and people. They are no different than any of us!\n\n \nSo, I myself have never actually met a librarian. Yeah, I, uh, since\nI am a scientist and not a writer or an editor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually\nhad to read a book.\n\n Cecil:\nOh!\n\n Carlos:\nYeah, and thus, um, yeah. And\xe2\x80\x93 and\xe2\x80\x93 and have never actually been\ninside a library. Uh, but, but I had friends in college who were\nliterature or journalism majors, and they told me that librarians did\nthings like\xe2\x80\xa6help recommend good books, and find important\ninformation related to their interests, and nearly all of my friends\nthat have visited a library are still alive.\n\n \nA little over half.\n\n \nAnyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what the panic is about!\n\n Cecil:\nNo, Carlos, listen to yourself. This is\xe2\x80\xa6this is insane!\n\n Carlos:\nPerhaps, you know, Cecil, but\xe2\x80\xa6as the great mathematician Albert\nEinstein once said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe definition of insanity is available inside\nthis cave. Come inside this cave. Come inside this cave and the\ndefinition will be told to you, it is so nice inside this cave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nTrue. No, Carlos, even though there are no librarians where you are,\nI want you to be safe. Or, better yet, come home soon.\n\n Carlos:\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again soon. I promise.\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with myself without you. I love you.\n\n Carlos:\nI love you too. And, you know, Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist.\nA scientist is always fine.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, listeners, I have to say, I certainly feel better having talked\nto Carlos\xe2\x80\xa6even though I have learned absolutely nothing new about\nthe escaped librarians.\n\n \nSo, Night Vale, all I can tell you is to board up your doors and\nwindows, turn out the lights, and\xe2\x80\x93 and do not answer your door for\nany reason. We do not yet know how long we must hide ourselves.\n\n \nAnd you must continue to live your lives. But, do so in a way that\ndraws no attention, that requires no light, or motion. J\xe2\x80\x93 Shut down\nyour lives, dear listeners, for fear of losing them. Just remove all\nsemblance of living to prolong, for a few more moments, that empty\nlife.\n\n \nBe safe, Night Vale. And I will do my best to keep bringing you the\nnews.\n\n Andrew:\nHello, Cecil?\n\n Cecil:\nIntern Andrew? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful to hear from you again. Are\nyou\xe2\x80\xa6are you at the library?\n\n Andrew:\nUh, yes. I have found my way into the library, it\xe2\x80\x99s very dark in\nhere. The construction crew is standing over the collapsed\nscaffolding, poking at it with sticks and ordering it to put itself\nback together again. Their antennae are in the non-aggressive\nposition, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they realize the danger they\xe2\x80\x99re in.\n\n Cecil:\nOK. Be careful, Andrew, but also\xe2\x80\xa6be closer to the story. Be much\ncloser and tell all of us what you see.\n\n Andrew:\nUh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m walking between the shelves, there are books all around\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel safe around so many books. There are small wallows\nhere and there where librarians have nested for the night. Some of\nthese look quite fresh.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, move quietly. There could still be a librarian somewhere.\n\n Andrew:\nThere is! There is a librarian! OK, it\xe2\x80\x99s seen me. It has me trapped\nin the biography section. There are so many books here about Helen\nHunt. I have no choice, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to fight my way out of this.\n\n Cecil:\nNo! No, you would never survive. Just pretend that you don\xe2\x80\x99t exist\nand hope that the librarian shares your delusion.\n\n Andrew:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I have my fencing sword in my hand. Say\ngoodbye to my mother. Wherever she\xe2\x80\x99s buried herself after the mine\nclosed, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna do her proud.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, I will definitely find\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Andrew:\nAnd say goodbye to my best friend Johann and my second-best friend\nJamie, and my tied-for-third best friends Xerxes and Hasad. Wish them\nwell on their artisanal upholstery business. Cover those chairs, my\nsweetest friends. Cover those chairs.\n\n Cecil:\nOk, I will\xe2\x80\xa6I will do that\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Andrew:\nAnd say goodbye to the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in My\nHome. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would have done without her. Well, probably\nmost of the same things I always did because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was\nthere until she started running for mayor, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m not clear how\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s secretly living anywhere.\nI mean, how is it a secret at this point?\n\n Cecil:\nHuh.\n\n Andrew:\nYeah, ask her that.\n\n Cecil:\nAll right.\n\n Andrew:\nAnd\xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0and\xe2\x80\x93 and kind of smirk while you ask her.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Andrew:\nLike, lean back, you know, cross your arms a little bit.\n\n Cecil:\nLike\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Andrew:\nMore\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nRrrrr\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Andrew:\nOK, great.\n\n Cecil:\nRrr\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n Andrew:\nSo\xe2\x80\xa6so do that. Do that for me.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, I wi\xe2\x80\x93 I will do all of those things.\n\n Andrew:\nWait! And say goodbye to Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat?\n\n Andrew:\nTell\nhim his voice is like swimming in a clear, cold underground river.\n\n Cecil:\nNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nCecil!\n\n Andrew:\nJust tell him for me!\n\n \nAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99m going in. This will be a perilous and lengthy\nstruggle. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be intertwined in a gruesome embrace until one of us\ndies. Maybe hours from now, maybe days.\n\n \nFor Night Vale!\n\n \nAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!\n\n Cecil:\nTo the family of intern Andrew WK: He was a brave intern\xe2\x80\xa6although\nnot very knowledgeable about fencing swords and their complete\ninability to cut human\nflesh, let alone librarian exoskeletons.\n\n \nAnd now, a public service announcement.\n\n The\nGreater Night Vale Medical Community is calling on all citizens to\nplease, give blood. There are always patients, unfortunate people,\nwho need your help. Sometimes there is a great natural disaster, like\nan earthquake or tornado, or even a great artificial\ndisaster, like scissor fog. But do not wait for these moments to give\nblood. Doctors need it every single day.\n\n \nNever given blood before? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy. The Greater Night Vale Medical\nCommunity knows that many of you are afraid of needles. But there are\nso many non-needle ways to get your blood: court injunction,\nsatellites, wolverines, a very carefully-staged \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d so\nplease, put aside your rational fear of needles and pain and give\nblood.\n\n \nThis message has been brought to you by the Greater Night Vale\nMedical Community, which\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nOK, this is weird. Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I said that I would ask.\n\n \nThe Greater Night Vale Medical Community wanted me to tell you that\nthey think that you are cute, and are you seeing anybody right now?\nBecause, listen, I told them that you were, so that way there\xe2\x80\x99s no\npressure on you, OK? But they still wanted me to ask, and they were\nvery persistent.\n\n \nYou know what? No. It\xe2\x80\x99s cool, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them that you are seeing\nsomebody, so there are no worries.\n\n \nListeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to doubt if I\xe2\x80\x99m as alone as I thought in this\nstudio. Um, I thought it was only me, and the monitoring cameras, and\nthe cameras that monitor the monitoring cameras\xe2\x80\xa6but I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning\nto feel something else. See something else. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home:\nCecil?\n\n Cecil:\nAahhhh! I think I know who this is!\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s me. The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home.\n\n Cecil:\nOf course. It is former mayoral candidate and hidden lurker watching\nall of us at all times, the Faceless Old Woman. Um, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely\nto have you here.\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nI am not a former candidate. I do not accept the results of the\nmayoral race, and I still consider myself your best choice for mayor.\nI wanted to make myself known to you and your listeners in this time\nof crisis to show how mayoral I am. It is very mayoral to stand near\ndisasters. I am very good at standing near things.\n\n \nI am less good at being seen, but I am working on that using a system\nof whistles and mirrors.\n\n Cecil:\nHuh. Mirrors.\n\n \nWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about this. What would you, as presumptive mayor,\nhave done differently with this librarian situation?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nOh, many things. Mayoral things. Profound and effective things. I\nwould have stood in the corners of dark rooms, shaking my head in\ndisappointment. I would have taken the uneaten lettuce from your\ncrisper and stapled it to your couch cushions. I would have filled\nevery dresser drawer with damp autumn leaves and uneasy dreams.\n\n Cecil:\nHmm.\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nI would have written the date of your death in blue highlighter on\nall of your shoes. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot you can do as mayor if you just stop\nand think. If you just stop all time, and think for centuries on a\nproblem while linear progression ceases and you continue to age on a\nseparate plane of existence.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd all of this would help get rid of the librarians on the loose in\nNight Vale?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nWhat? Oh, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that. That was just a list of things\nI would do regardless of intentions or consequences.\n\n \nLibrarians are pretty awful, but I can always hide. I live secretly\nin your home, not obstreperously like the rest of you, chewing loudly\nand playing brass instruments and stomping around in thick boots\nthrough a haze of television chatter and sublimated sadness.\n\n \nAlso, stop being so self conscious about your weight. Your shirts are\nall a full size too big. I\xe2\x80\x99ve cut them into fabric strips and made an\nottoman of them.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, uh, Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly\xe2\x80\x93 but l\xe2\x80\x93 listen. Is\nthere a shorter name that I can call you, by the way?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nYes.\n\n Cecil:\nOh! What is it?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll whisper it into your ear.\n\n Cecil:\nUh?\n\n [exaggerated\nwhispering sounds]\n\n \nOhhh\xe2\x80\xa6really?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell!\n\n Cecil:\nOK, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell!\n\n Cecil:\nOK. All right, all right.\n\n \nWell. Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, uh, even if\nyou are safe from librarians, um, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t your top concern as\nmayoral candidate be for the safety of your constituents?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nYes, it should. But \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis\xe2\x80\x9d are different words for\nmany reasons. Spelling is one reason; there are other reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderstandable you\xe2\x80\x99re alarmed, but\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s also quite dull. I\xe2\x80\x99m bored\nwith your fear. I want to talk about the death you cannot see, the\ndangers you do not fear because you do not know. That is interesting\nto me.\n\n Cecil:\nNow, what dangers do we not see? Please, please tell us.\n\n \nOK, she\xe2\x80\x99s whispering in my ear again\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [exaggerated\nwhispering sounds]\n\n \nWhat? Him? Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s so sweet!\n\n [exaggerated\nwhispering sounds]\n\n \nWha\xe2\x80\x93 her, too? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\n\n [exaggerated\nwhispering sounds]\n\n \nOh, I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\n\n [exaggerated\nwhispering sounds]\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nWell, most doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to stop the swelling or stench\nat all.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible, Faceless Old Woman!\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nYou meant \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d You said \xe2\x80\x9cterrible,\xe2\x80\x9d you meant\n\xe2\x80\x9cinteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s all going to be OK.\n\n Cecil:\nIt will? How?\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nWell, it actually won\xe2\x80\x99t be. I was lying. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll always\nbe there for you.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, well that\xe2\x80\x99s very sweet of you, Faceless Old Woman!\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman:\nOh, look. Diane Creighton has throat spiders. I need to see this.\n\n Cecil:\nHello? Hellooo?\n\n \nWell, it seems like she\xe2\x80\x99s gone again.\n\n Listeners,\nthe worst has just happened. We are getting reports that a librarian\nhas entered a theater. Thankfully, you are not one of those doomed\nsouls who risked their lives for something as useless\nas live theater! Ha ha ha! Ahh, ha ha! Ahh.\n\n \nBut let us all, as an exercise in empathy, imagine what it would be\nlike to be one of those unfortunates in their last oblivious moments.\nImagine you are in a theater. Imagine rows of seats. Imagine a stage.\nImagine amplification, and the person seated a row behind you\nconsistently whispering to their friend. Picture this. Picture\nyourself as you would never be, in a crowd of listening strangers.\n\n \nNow, imagine the librarian in the theater, not yet spotted in the\ndark of the house. Imagine it slithering silently beneath the theater\nseats. What if, hypothetical theater-goer, it were under the seat\nthat you were in right now?\n\n Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nlook! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look!\n\n \nIf it saw you, what would it decide to do to you?\n\n \nOK, there is safety in numbers. Everyone at once, now, look!\n\n \nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there! You are safe in your imagined theater seat.\nOr, maybe, the librarian anticipated your movement and slipped out of\nview just as you looked. That is a possibility, too. What is\nwonderful about this world is that anything is possible. Anything\nthat can eventually result in your death is possible.\n\n \nOh. Was that a dry, scaled hand upon your shoulder?\n\n \nNo, not that shoulder. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the other one. Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nOh. Ooohhhh. It keeps moving back and forth. And you begin to feel\nbreath faintly on the back of your neck. So faintly that you dismiss\nit, over and over until it dismisses you for good.\n\n \nAnd one by one by one, people are disappearing from their theater\nseats without a sound, just a flash of red and a dark stain. And your\nbrain adjusts for this by remembering those seats as always having\nbeen empty and moist.\n\n And\nthen, then the screams start. First the left side of the theater! And\nthen the right side of the theater! And the entire theater is\nscreaming! And one person in the front row stands up, and they are\ntearing at their hair, and they are howling!\n\n And\nwait! Wait! The entire\nfront row stands up, and the entire front row is clutching at their\nchests, and they are screaming louder than the entire theater\ncombined!\n\n \nAnd then, there is silence.\n\n \nUtter silence.\n\n \nAnd the front row sits down.\n\n \nAnd the silence is worse than the screams. And no one is saying\nanything at all. And no one is making the slightest move. And the\nlibrarian\xe2\x80\xa6it is above them.\n\n \nDon\xe2\x80\x99t look up!\n\n \nAnd the librarian begins to descend, perhaps on a web, perhaps on\ngreat black wings, perhaps with its tendrils wrapped around the walls\nand the beams of the theater and it\xe2\x80\x99s jaws begin to open and it\nfocuses on one single person.\n\n Don\xe2\x80\x99t look up!\n\n \nAnd while that person waits, unknowingly, to get taken, I take all of\nyou, safe at home of course, not actually helpless in a theater, to\nthe weather!\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cSerpentine\nCycle of Money\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Carrie\nElkin\nand Danny\nSchmidt]\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, good news! I mean, the news was always good for you,\nsafe at home, with only a few hidden entities lurking around you (and\nnone of them quite as dangerous as librarians) but, the news is\nsurprisingly also good for those screaming victims trapped in the\ntheater.\n\n \nThe librarians have been recaptured.\n\n \nNot by the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police, not by Tamika Flynn and her\nvaliant band of well-read child vigilantes, but by the librarians\nthemselves.\n\n \nWe have learned that the initial escapee was named Randall, and we\nhave also learned that Randall was trying to leave his job as a\nlibrarian. He was curious about all the other jobs in the world, as\nhe had been born a librarian and had only ever known the secret evils\nand dark magics of library science.\n\n \nRandall wanted to know what it would be like to work as a\nconstruction contractor, an auto body mechanic, a food coop manager,\na municipal park employee, a Hooded Figure. There is a whole world of\noccupations and opportunities in America.\n\n \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a free country,\xe2\x80\x9d we regularly explain to ourselves,\nwithout quite knowing what we mean.\n\n \nAnd Randall even slipped into a theater to find out what it might be\nlike to be a folk singer, or an actor, or an usher, or just a regular\nperson \xe2\x80\x93 just a human, filled with regret and worry, trying to find\na moment outside of themselves by watching a live performance.\n\n But\nthe librarians, knowing that they are not human (far from it), found\nRandall and brought him back to the library. For while they are\nterrible, blood-thirsty pseudo reptilians, librarians are also quite\norganized. Just as they would never want a highly-researched\nnonfiction travel guide like Stephen King\xe2\x80\x99s The\nDark Tower\nseries to end up in, say, Fiction, or a sci-fi fantasy comic book\nlike Pat Conroy\xe2\x80\x99s The\nPrince of Tides\nto end up in Religious Studies, librarians also know that they should\nnever be seen or felt or heard outside of a library. Librarians know\nthat they cannot enter society and coexist with humans without\nsuccumbing to intense hunger and curiosity and\xe2\x80\xa6tearing us all into\npink pulpy piles of post-existence.\n\n \nSo, they dragged unhappy Randall from the theater, along with a\ncouple of collateral audience members.\n\n \nAnd the people in the theater were filled with relief, and shaking\nwith the echo of their terror. And they each turned to a person\nseated near them \xe2\x80\x93 not a person that they came with \xe2\x80\x93 they each\nturned to a complete stranger and they said, to that stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare alive for now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nAnd then they said, to that stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\nthey shared a couple of moments of eye contact to acknowledge the\nunlikelihood of that claim.\n\n \nOne\xe2\x80\xa6two\xe2\x80\xa6and then they turned away, uncomfortable with all that\neyeballs and vision might imply, and then they said, to that\nstranger, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was nice to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, each one of\nthem said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Amanda,\xe2\x80\x9d even though very few of them were\nactually named Amanda. Very few.\n\n \nThen the show went on, and that moment of exchange hung between all\nthe strangers in the audience, latent, and invisible. Perhaps to be\nreprised later, or perhaps already only existing in the poor\nreconstruction of memory.\n\n As\nusual, we had nothing to fear. And, in saying that, I mean we have\neverything\nto fear.\n\n \nDeath is slotted for us all, and maybe it is years from now \xe2\x80\x93 in a\nsoft bed, surrounded by the soft eyes of the people that we love \xe2\x80\x93\nor, maybe, it is not so many years from now at all. And we have every\nreason to be afraid. But we also need to learn to put that fear\naside, like a library book. Sometimes we need to check out our fear,\nand\xe2\x80\x93 and\xe2\x80\x93 and read it, and\xe2\x80\x93 and study it and peruse it closely,\nbut at a certain point return it to its proper shelf and experience\nsomething else.\n\n \nContentment.\n\n \nWorry.\n\n \nCalm.\n\n \nHunger.\n\n \nSpinal parasites.\n\n \nAnd a great deal of love, of every kind.\n\n \nSo put that fear in a place where you can find it when you need it,\nbut don\xe2\x80\x99t carry it with you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t carry it with you.\n\n \nStay tuned next for a shuffling movement outwards, the dimming of\nlights, and a large hall left empty and silent until the next time it\nis not.\n\n \nGoodnight to all of you, listeners.\n\n \nAnd goodnight, Night Vale.

Um, how was that?\n\n Louie:\nThanks for having me.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd since then, you have been appearing in frightened children\xe2\x80\x99s\nmirrors to teach them the basics of music theory and some simple\nbluegrass licks before, uh, taking their souls with you into the dark\nof the mirror world. Is that right?\n\n Louie:\nYou know, thank you so much for having me.\n\n Cecil:\nWonderful. All right, Louie. Let\xe2\x80\x99s learn some bluegrass!\n\n Louie:\nRight. Hello, listeners! Thanks for having me. I want to start out\nwith something really, really simple. This is a basic G major scale.\n\n [weakly and\nscratchily sings a note, twice, the second time until his voice fades\nas he runs out of air]\n\n Cecil:\nGreat! Um, that seems really easy!\n\n Louie:\nYeah, you have no idea how easy it can be. So, now that we know a G\nmajor scale, we can start doing some simple bluegrass licks around\nthose notes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a real easy one.\n\n [a cacophony of\nsound from an accordion]\n\n Cecil:\nWow, I think\xe2\x80\xa6I think even somebody like an old fumble-hands like me\ncould handle that one, right?\n\n Louie:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what the human body is capable of. So now, let\xe2\x80\x99s take\neverything we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned so far, and try putting it all together.\nCheck this out.\n\n [the cacophony\nof accordion noise accompanies the following screaming dialogue]\n\n No! No! Noooo!\nNo! They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see me! They will not find me! Make them close\ntheir eyes! Make them close their eyes! There\xe2\x80\x99s a light I can\xe2\x80\x99t put\nout. There is a light I could never put out!\n\n [screams]\n\n Make them close\ntheir eyes! Make them close their eyes!\n\n [a final chord\nends the accordion music]\n\n \nSo you see, it\xe2\x80\x99s really, really easy to take these basic elements and\nrecombine them to make something original, catchy, and fun.\n\n Cecil:\nYeah! You know, for a second there I could actually see nothing at\nall. That\xe2\x80\x99s fun!\n\n Louie:\nWell yes, uh, thanks for having me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again soon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see\nall of you again real soon. Thanks for having me. Thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see\nyou all soon.\n\n Cecil:\nWow. Thank you, Louie! Haha!"
