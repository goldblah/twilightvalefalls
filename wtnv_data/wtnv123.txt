Episode 104 - The Hierarchy of Angels
b'I know you are, but what am I? What am I? What am I? \n\n What. Am. I? \n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n I should start today with something happy. In his\nspeech yesterday honoring the life of Old Woman Josie, Larry Leroy out on the\nedge of town, and Josie\xe2\x80\x99s closest neighbor, told a story about his pickup\nbreaking down a few years ago. Josie had stopped on the roadside to help him push\nthe old Chevy the mile or so to his house. In the last few hundred feet, the\ntruck picked up momentum on the sloped road, and it rolled out of their control\ninto a large cactus. They heard a surprised yelp, and saw Telly the Barber\nwide-eyed and sweating, holding a pair of shears. Josie and Larry laughed and\nlaughed. Even the surprised Telly laughed. Larry then asked Telly why he was\ncutting that cactus\xe2\x80\x99 hair. Telly gulped and ran away, still laughing and\nsweating profusely.\n\n Larry told the gathered mourners that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nmany friends in town, but Old Woman Josie was always kind to him. Always a\nsmile, always happy to help. Always good for a giggle when she caught Telly\ngiving cacti haircuts. \n\n \xc2\xa0The services were beautiful, you know that. You were all\nthere. We were all there. I know I said gathered mourners but in a way,\nwe were gathered celebrants, extolling the great life of a great woman, now\ngone. Today is the scattering of her ashes and the city is working to fulfil\nJosie\xe2\x80\x99s wishes. They are joined in this endeavour by several beings claiming to\nbe angels. The city is trying to ignore the angels\xe2\x80\x99 request to help because it\nis illegal to acknowledge the existence of angels, so\xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this goes.\n\n The dozens of five-headed dragons, who came to our\nworld after the botched, yet partially successful execution of fellow dragon\nHiram McDaniels, are still in town. Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Hadassah, had promised\nvengeance for the wrongful murder of Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head. But after several\nweeks of setting fire to local businesses, and devouring a few of the more\nmuscular human citizens, the dragons have gone mostly silent. Their\naggression\xe2\x80\x99s now limited to some blatant jaywalking and loitering. There has\nbeen one report of an unidentified five-headed dragon hurling a crumpled Fresca\ncan basketball-style at a trash bin, missing the trash bin wildly, and then\npicking the soda can up and gently tossing it into the bin, only to have it\nclumsily fall out and back onto the ground. Onlookers were shocked to see that\nthe dragon did not even attempt a third put-back, and the can is still lying on\nthe ground this very moment. The can is still. On the ground. Mayor Cardinal\nhas called on the Sheriff for stricter enforcement of minor offenses, so they\ndo not escalate into more sinister crimes. Plus, she added, if we do not clean\nlitter from our curbs, the street cleaners might show up, and we simply cannot\nafford the loss of innocent lives that would cause. More on this as it\ndevelops.\n\n Josie\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Alondra Ortiz, who came to town last\nyear to be with her ailing mother until Josie passed away, is now sorting\nthrough Josie\xe2\x80\x99s estate and documents. Alondra said she found no will in\nJosie\xe2\x80\x99s files, only a piece of paper that said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt all belongs to the angels.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut Alondra noted the handwriting was written shakily in thick Magic Marker,\nand every word but \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d was misspelled. She believes the beings who\nclaim to be angels wrote this, not her mother. The angels responded, \xe2\x80\x9cnuh-uh\xe2\x80\x9d,\nand then nervously wiped their brows with clearly ink-stained hands. Alondra\nhired in an estate lawyer to help sort out liquidation of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s assets.\nAlondra said she just wants to be done with all this and go back home. When\nasked where home was, Alondra responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I\nremember? That\xe2\x80\x99s not important, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s super-important but not to this\ndiscussion. Oh god, what is wrong with me, with this town?\xe2\x80\x9d A single-engine\nplane then flew across the horizon behind her, trailing a banner that read,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOoooh! I found some teeth!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Listeners, some of you have asked about our intern,\nKareem. He\xe2\x80\x99s been at the station for so long, about 16 months, much longer than\nany other intern in recent memory. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to report he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer\nwith us. He was a good intern and he will be missed. Kareem changed majors from\ncommunications to Earth sciences and no longer needs this radio internship. He\nis taking classes with Professor Simone Rigideau at Night Vale Community\nCollege. Simone is not actually employed by NVCC, and in one of Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s last\njournalistic endeavours here at the station, he even found a copy of her death\ncertificate, dated 1983, although she does not show any signs of being a ghost.\nBut apparently her knowledge of Earth sciences intrigued Kareem enough that he\nwanted to change career trajectories. Kareem told me on his last day, which was\ntoday, like five minutes before I started my broadcast is when I find out about\nthis. He told me Simone knows what happened to Night Vale, why Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s family\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know him anymore, and why he can\xe2\x80\x99t find Mitchigan, or whatever is home\nstate is, on a map. I\xe2\x80\x99m just happy Kareem is pursuing his dreams, even if he\xe2\x80\x99s\ngonna lose alll those journalism credits! And today\xe2\x80\x99s filing will have to be\ndone by an overworked radio host before he gets to go home to his husband.\nGonna be a looong path to that degree, Kareem! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll do great.\xc2\xa0\n\n Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to caution you away from driving\nnear downtown. Road crews have shut down all streets in all directions, as a\nconstruction team is building a series of elaborate rollercoasters and\namusement park rides, many of which do dives and loops around, under, and\nthrough the surrounding buildings and even roads. It\xe2\x80\x99s complete gridlock all\nover downtown, with cars unable to drive into or out of the jam. On the plus\nside, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty cool looking Aquaman ride that does a double-twisting\nloop through a large pool of water that is elevated more than 50 feet off the\nground. Mayor Cardinal is on the scene arguing with the construction team about\ntheir lack of development permits. The construction crew, who are all tall\nglowing beings with wings, showed the Mayor a piece of paper that said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis all totally fine, Josie said we can build this, OK? Signed, City\xe2\x80\x9d, written\nin a Magic Marker and nearly every word misspelled.\n\n Allondra Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer, Emilio Tavarez, filed an\ninjunction to halt the work, saying that the funds used toward the construction\nof these rollercoasters were part of Josie\xe2\x80\x99s estate, and were being\nmisappropriated by the so-called angels. There is no documentation showing\nJosie wished her money to be spent this way, Tavarez explained. The\nconstruction team then mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cA dummy says what?\xe2\x80\x9d And Tavarez said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\nand they all laughed, including the Mayor who then added, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah but yeah\nseriously, you need building permits, even if you are fulfilling the elaborate\nwishes of the deceased.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on this soon, but first, a quick\nbreak.\n\n Hi, this is Cecil. Leave a message!\xc2\xa0\n\n Steve Carlsberg: Hello, Cecil? It\xe2\x80\x99s Steve. OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\nsure if you\xe2\x80\x99re there or not. Last few times I called, you said to leave a\nmessage at the tone, and then halfway into my message you interrupted me and\nsaid, [Cecil impersonation] \xe2\x80\x9cHa ha, Steve. You fell for it again.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\xe2\x80\x99m just\nmaking sure you\xe2\x80\x99re actually there this time. I have something I wanted to tell\nyou so you could report it on your show. Are you there, Cecil? I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna\nfall for your trick again.\n\n OK. Well. I was getting some coffee over at the Spiky\nHammer, and I held the door for this woman I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize. She just stared\nat me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t say thank you or anything. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold doors for\napproval, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a nice thing to do, but she efforted to not thank me,\nyou know? And then when I stood in line, she stood right next to me, her face\njust inches from mine, staring at me. I tried not to look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not nice to\nstare. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything for the longest time, but right as I placed my\norder, a large crab legs macchiato with (quad shot) and whipped cream, she\nstarted whispering loudly in my ear! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what she was saying,\nand it made it difficult to talk to the barista. And then, when I turned to ask\nher politely if she wanted me to get her something, she was gone. Oh I wish I\ncould remember what the woman said. Oh gosh. It was something like,\nhmmmmmmmmmm.. \n\n [voice distorts] The Woman from Italy has come back to\ntown. Nothing can stop her from tearing it down! She lives for your screams,\nmakes meals of your tears. She revels in chaos and deals in your fears.\xc2\xa0\n\n We all huddle and hide from the pain yet to come,\nhuddled hidden with loved ones, perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99ll spare some.\n\n She brings the torture, the trouble, the stress, so\ncan you order for her a double espresso? \n\n\n [normal voice] Well I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what she said. If\nI think of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you back. Anyway, sorry I missed you Cecil!\n\n \xc2\xa0Cecil: I\xe2\x80\x99m here, Steve! You totally fell for it.\n\n \xc2\xa0Steve: Oh, oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho, you got me!\n\n \xc2\xa0Cecil: Basic stuff, Steve.\n\n Steve: Sure is! Wow, you got me good! [chuckles]\n\n Cecil: I tease you because I love you, Steve.\n\n Steve: Aww, Cecil. I love you too, big brother!\n\n Cecil: Just kidding, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here! Please leave your message after the tone.\n[beep]\n\n Steve: Hello? Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what just happened. I\nguess I\xe2\x80\x99ll try again later.\n\n \xe2\x80\x93\n\n Sorry of the interruption. Oh, looks like I got a\nvoicemail. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s from Steve Carlsberg. Well, never mind, there\xe2\x80\x99s breaking\nnews right now.\n\n Stay far away from downtown, listeners. The traffic\njam caused by the halted construction project is in great danger. The cars are\nhonking noisily, people are abandoning their vehicles, but the Sheriff is\nasking everyone to seek immediate shelter. Several dragons are converging on\nthe scene. The dragons have everyone in the congested area completely\nsurrounded. They are walking \xe2\x80\x93 no, stomping toward the helpless citizens\ntrapped in traffic. Night Vale, do not go out on the roads. The dragons have us\nexactly where they want us. What a disastrous trap! Be safe.\n\n And as I try to find out more on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in\ndowntown, please hear this important weather report.\xc2\xa0\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cQualified\xe2\x80\x9d by Sammus feat. Open Mike Eagle,\nsammusmusic.bandcamp.com]\n\n Here is the secret hierarchy of angels. \n\n Deceased humans can become angels, but few humans do.\nAngels are immortal beings, but not all of them are former human souls. Some\nare animals, some plants. Some outdated electronics.\n\n \nThey are all named Erika with a K. All angels are equal to all other angels.\nThey share all memories and all physical sensations. They experience everything\nsimultaneously. Their minds are overwhelmed with enlightenment and pain.\n\n \nThey have no centralized leadership, but they do have committees, lots of\ncommittees. These committees do not have titles nor objectives. The committees\nsimply emerge as needed.\xc2\xa0\n\n Angels are wealthy, but do not understand currency. They\nwill often ask to borrow 10 bucks.\n\n \nAngels have no bodies, only visual projections of winged, barely humanoid\nforms. These forms are dreamed up by those who see and acknowledge them, and\nmay vary based on the viewer.\n\n \nThe secret hierarchy of angels is an ethereal mass of feelings and thoughts\nmade manifest by necessity. They\xe2\x80\x99re only individual beings because we imagine\nthem so, but they are collectively beings.\n\n It is illegal to speak of or acknowledge in any way the\nsecret hierarchy of angels. But. I. will. Acknowledge it. here, on the radio. I\xe2\x80\x99m\nan objective journalist, which does not mean I have no morals or opinions, just\nthat I can be self-aware of my biases and emotions, yet still report a story\ntransparently to you. You may not agree with my point of view, but I will do. My.\nBest. To give you the information you need to decide that on your own.\n\n In the case of the angels, I acknowledge them. I see\nthem! And because Josie always said such, I too believe that they are real\nbeings, and are entitled to Josie\xe2\x80\x99s estate. So does five-headed dragon Miriam\nAdelman. She\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer, and the angels hired her to represent their case for\nmanagement of Josie\xe2\x80\x99s will.\n\n Oh, the dragons did not do any harm to those in\ntraffic today. They were simply the legal team coming to help facilitate Josie\xe2\x80\x99s\nfinal wish, which was to build a Night Vale sculpture garden, complete with the\nusual rollercoasters and tilt-a-whirls, and an enormous ferris wheel.\xc2\xa0\n\n Josie wanted to have her ashes scattered underneath\n(Jacobo Manzu\xe2\x80\x99s) [0:22:17] famous sculpture, \xe2\x80\x9cTop Thrill Dragster\xe2\x80\x9d, which is a\n400-foot drop and reaches over 120 miles per hour. Adelman and her legal team\nmanaged to push through the sculpture garden construction, which is now\ncomplete, and Josie\xe2\x80\x99s ashes have finally been honored in the way she wanted. Alondra ceded this ground because she understood how important this town was to\nJosie. But she added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s home, her belongings, her money, her legacy \xe2\x80\x93\nthese are all I have of my family. I have no siblings, no cousins, and no\nparents. I am the only Ortiz left. I do not know or understand Night Vale,\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlondra said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe in angels, nor dragons for that matter, I just\nwant what is left of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and then I want to go home, wherever that\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d The city has declined to hear further arguments about estate ownership from\nAdelman or her angel clients, as the dragons are not licensed to practice law\nanywhere on this Earth, and their clients, the angels, don\xe2\x80\x99t legally exist.\n\n The secret hierarchy of angels is a cloud of knowledge,\nformed from the collected experiences of the deceased. Josie might be among\nthem now, or she might know. All I know is that Josie loved Night Vale and we\nloved her.\n\n I am going to go to the sculpture garden today to pay\nmy respects. Carlos and I will hold hands and lay flowers at the ash-strewn\nbase of (Manzu\xe2\x80\x99s) towering masterpiece of contemporary sculpture. And then, we\nwill purchase a souvenir photo of ourselves screaming in joy and sorrow, while\nengaged in a 120-mile per hour freefall, demonstrating our fervent arts\nadovacy, exactly as Josie would have wanted.\n\n I hope all of you will join me in honoring not only\nthe life of Josefina Ortiz, but the lives of the angels who loved her too.\n\n Stay tuned next for hosts Josh and Chuck and their\nwildly popular show, \xe2\x80\x9cStuff You Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Know\xe2\x80\x9d, which as usual will be an\nunbroken reduction beep for 30 straight minutes. No one has ever heard Josh or\nChuck speak.\n\n \nAnd as always, good night, Night Vale.\n\n Josie was beautiful and angels are real!\n\n Good night.'
