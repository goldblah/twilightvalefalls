So, our newest live\nrecording, The Investigators, was released on Bandcamp recently, and\nwe said it would be released on iTunes \xe2\x80\x9csoon.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, as of today\n\xe2\x80\x93 as of this very moment, in fact \xe2\x80\x93 that \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d has become\n\xe2\x80\x9cnow.\xe2\x80\x9d It is available on iTunes now. Over two hours of new Night\nVale live material, featuring something like 15 guest stars and live\nmusic Disparition and Eliza Rickman, available right now on iTunes\nand still available at nightvale.bandcamp.com.\n\n To\ncelebrate, here is a clip from The Investigators. It is one of the\nbonus tracks of the recording, featuring Wil Wheaton as Earl Harlan.\nEnjoy.\n\n \nCecil:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look now at the Community Calendar.\n\n \nWednesday\nevening, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s most popular restaurant, Tourniquet, will be\nhosting a special chef\xe2\x80\x99s table dinner. To learn more about this, we\nhave Tourniquet\xe2\x80\x99s sous-chef, Earl Harlan, right now on the phone\nwith us. Thanks for joining us, Earl!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Thank you, Cecil! Well, the annual chef\xe2\x80\x99s table\ndinner is a special night, when our executive chef, LaShawn Mason,\npersonally curates and prepares a five-course tasting menu. It\xe2\x80\x99s\n500 dollars prix fixe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s limited to only 13 attendees, so it\nwill be an intimate and a unique experience.\n\n \nChef\nMason wants to share some brand new dishes he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on in\nhis test kitchen. He hand-delivers each dish to the diners.\n[creepily] And\nthen\xe2\x80\xa6 he lingers\xe2\x80\xa6slowly over each diner, as they eat. Explaining\nevery single bite, as he touches their chins\xe2\x80\xa6gently with his rough\nthumbs\xe2\x80\xa6and his soft\xe2\x80\xa6moist palms\xe2\x80\xa6lifting their mandibles up and\ndown\xe2\x80\xa6to help them through the first stage\xe2\x80\xa6of the human digestive\nprocess. He also matches his heartbeat with theirs. Everyone\xe2\x80\xa6at the\nchef\xe2\x80\x99s table\xe2\x80\xa6will share a heartbeat.\n\n \nCecil:\nThat sounds very posh!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Have you ever listened to a heartbeat, Cecil?\n\n \nCecil:\nOh sure. Yeah, I can actually hear my own right now, very loudly in\nmy headphones, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Po-pom, po-pom, po-pom-pom-pom-pom-po\xe2\x80\xa6Pom\npom pom pom pom pom pom pom pom popopopopopom,\npommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: That sounds terrifying.\n\n \nCecil:\nIt is!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Anyway, this year\xe2\x80\x99s dinner will center around\nquail.\n\n \nCecil:\nOoh!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Chef Mason recently rediscovered the joy of quail\nmeat, while on a spiritual retreat underneath his own bed. He was\nthere for weeks, curled into a fetal position, alternating between\nscreaming and crying, and clenching his eyes and teeth tightly,\nbecause he is really\ninto meditation these days.\n\n \nDuring\nthe retreat, he found several quail living in his box spring\nmattress. And they were his only friends. He named them Ann, George,\nLatimer, Kaska, and Junior, and Friday. They all kept each other\ncompany in the cold dark night. And later when Chef Mason got hungry,\nhe ate them all. It was hard to lose such good friends. But they were\nso delicious, he wanted to share that flavor with Night Vale.\n\n \nCecil:\nSo, will you be at the dinner, Earl?\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Oh yes! Yes, I will wake up that morning, and I\nwill stare at myself in the mirror repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do this,\nEarl. You can do\nthis, Earl. You can do\nthis, Earl.\xe2\x80\x9d Until my reflection says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll brush each others\xe2\x80\x99 teeth, and trim each others\xe2\x80\x99\nmustaches, and comb each others\xe2\x80\x99 hair\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nCecil:\nAwwww!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: \xe2\x80\xa6and then step through the mirror and once again\nswitch places in each others\xe2\x80\x99 mirrored world for the day.\n\n \nCecil:\nAh!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive my car slowly into the parking lot of\nTourniquet, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll call my son to tell him I love him. And\nthat I remembered his name, which I can do most days.\n\n \nCecil:\nOh!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll sigh heavily, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my\ntuque and my jacket, and do my job.\n\n \nCecil:\nWell, it is such a blessing to have a career that you love! So, what\ncan the diners expect at this rare culinary event?\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Well, we will start with quail salad with a fig\nand orange milk dressing.\n\n \nCecil:\nMm!\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Followed by a large amount of quail eggs dropped\nfrom the ceiling. Then pasta made entirely from beaks.\n\n \nCecil:\nHuh.\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Then the main course, in which I\xe2\x80\x99ll use a\nbullhorn to recite instructions for gutting and cleaning, while each\ndiner is given a live quail and a brick.\n\n \nCecil:\nOhhh! Mmmm! Oh, It says \xe2\x80\x93 your press release says that dinner\nbegins at 7:30.\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: 7:30 PM on the dot! Now this is one of the coolest\nparts of the whole night. It\xe2\x80\x99s right at 7:30, when all of the\ndiners from last year\xe2\x80\x99s event will finally be released from the\nkitchen\xe2\x80\xa6and sent back to their old lives.\n\n \nCecil:\nAwww. Well that sounds fun.\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Oh the sounds. There\xe2\x80\xa6are so\xe2\x80\xa6many\xe2\x80\xa6sounds,\nCecil. There are so\nmany things to hear\xe2\x80\xa6and to deal with.\n\n \nCecil:\n[very long beat]\n\xe2\x80\xa6Yes there are a lot of sounds, Earl. Um, thankfully my job is to\ntalk and not to listen. Um, it is great to have you on the show,\nEarl. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this again soon, OK?\n\n \nEarl\nHarlan: Bye bye Cecil, talk to you soon.\n\n \nCecil:\nAlright, bye Earl.\n\n \nJoseph\nFink:\nThe Investigators.
