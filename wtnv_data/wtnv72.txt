Episode 63 - There Is No Part 1: Part 2
b'There is no Part 1. This is Part 2.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Listeners, I won\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time\nrecapping everything that happened in the earlier part of this\nbroadcast. There were so many events of such tremendous impact and\nsignificance, that they\xe2\x80\x99re surely locked forever in your memory. So,\nlet us \xe2\x80\x93 a town with an imperiled mayor, and a brutally injured\nSheriff, a town under attack, a town in the middle of something that\nwe are seeing through from start to finish \xe2\x80\x93 let us continue right\nwhere we left off.\n\n Harrison Kip, adjunct professor of\narchaeology at the Community College, announced once again that he is\nsuper sorry about\naccidentally raising the sand golem by whispering sweet nothings to\nthat talisman he found out in the desert.\n\n The\nteam of six wealthy sponsors who backed this project, and who he has\nonly ever spoken to by phone, told him that this was what mysterious\ntalismans liked. \xe2\x80\x9cTalismans love to be flirted with in a sexy\nwhisper,\xe2\x80\x9d the anonymous sponsors had told him. Although they never\nmentioned that doing so would cause a sand golem to rise and turn\nagainst the humans around it.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nbad,\xe2\x80\x9d Harrison said, gravely, continuing, \xe2\x80\x9cMos\xe2\x80\x99 def, my bad,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbefore fleeing into the desert, receding from human form, to distant\nhuman form, to dot, to smudge, to misplaced pixel on the horizon\nline, to memory, to vague recollection, to an idea just out of reach,\nto something I knew long ago but now cannot grasp enough to feel its\nabsence.\n\n The\nsand golem \xe2\x80\x93 along with thousands of Angora rabbits, which were\nreleased from the Night Vale Petting Zoo by unknown malicious parties\n\xe2\x80\x93 have reached the upper floors of City Hall and are attacking\nanything that moves. Or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move. Or just exists, anywhere on the\nspectrum of motion, with its huge sand fists and their soft, harmless\nfur.\n\n Director\nof Emergency Press Conferences, Pamela Winchell, held a non-emergency\npress conference, explaining that the situation seemed too urgent to\ndistract everyone with the usual emergency press conference. She read\na statement written by Mayor Dana Cardinal, indicating that the mayor\nhas given up on her previously announced plan to barricade the door,\nand then found her subsequently announced plan to hide was ruined\nwhen she released the statement announcing it. And so now, she is\nannouncing her current plan, which is to fight. To fight and to\nwin.\n\n Listeners,\nI would gladly help the mayor but, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been regularly expressing\nthroughout the morning\xe2\x80\x99s tragedies and this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s attack, I\nhave conflicted feelings here. Yes, mayor Dana is a dear friend, and\none of the citizens of this town I trust the most, but\xe2\x80\xa6but\xe2\x80\xa6the\nlast time I helped her, it was done without my will. Not against\nmy will, without. I was used as a puppet to save a good friend, and\ngood friend though she is, it is not a feeling I wish to experience\nagain.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ntell you what I think it is. I believe the culprit is whoever bought\nLot 37 from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police Auction last year. Lot 37:\none radio host. One Cecil Palmer. One me.\nI believe whoever owns that lot has manipulated me into the role of\nhero. Like an action figure, limp in the sticky hands of a child. I\ndo not wish to be manipulated again, except in that way that anyone\nwho lives in an all-seeing authoritarian state is constantly\nmanipulated for their own health and well-being. Such is the wish of\nall people: to be manipulated in ways that are good for them. But,\nall to say, maybe someone else can help Dana this time.\n\n More\nand more on this soon, as there has been much and much before.\n\n Construction\nwork is already commencing at the bowling alley after the shocking\nincident we reported on earlier today. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nnever look at one of those ball return machines the same way again.\n\n Teddy\nWilliams said the space should again be available for bowling by\nWednesday at the latest, that league night is set to continue as\nscheduled, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s had enough. Just enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s only so\nmuch one person, you know, that one person can take, and that limit\nwas reached several months ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s just been coasting. You\nknow, coasting, trying, doing his best, and now this? Now, this.\nRight? Now, this.\n\n He\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what next, what now, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to\ndo. Probably not this\nanymore, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think. How old do you have to be to retire? How\nold is he? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to those questions, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll\nfind out, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\xa6know, you know? He\xe2\x80\x99ll know.\n\n And\nagain, league night is continuing as scheduled. Which\xe2\x80\xa6whoo!\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a good week for me without league night!\n\n And\nnow, another word from our sponsors.\n\n You\nalready know who we are. We introduced ourselves earlier. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not\nwaste time reiterating the benefits of our product, how little it\ncosts, how easy it is to get, how unwise it would be not to buy it,\nand where exactly we took your loved ones.\n\n Instead,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s concentrate on the legally-required disclaimers. We, uh, we\nforgot to do those, and our lawyer got really\nmad about it. Have you ever seen a mad lawyer? Their ears stand\nstraight up, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t stop barking at you. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6terrifying.\n\n So,\nwe need to add that using our product could result in sterility,\nsenility, hearing loss, vision loss, finger decomposition, major toe\nswelling\xe2\x80\xa6like a lot\nof toe swelling \xe2\x80\x93 that might not sound like a big deal, but wait\nuntil you see how big your toes get \xe2\x80\x93 scratchiness of the throat,\nthroat loss, heart palpitations and minor night screaming.\n\n Also,\nwhen we said hearing loss, we meant you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to hear loss. As\nplants age, as pets die, as marriages break apart, or evolve, or\nsettle from a fluttering of hands to a loose intertwining of fingers,\nas children leave home to go wherever it is that children go after\nthe age of 10, all of these common forms of loss you will be able to\nhear, it will be deafening.\n\n Oh,\nwe could go on all day about the ways our product will severely ruin\nyou, physically and emotionally, but what are you going to do? Not\nbuy it? I think that you and your (for the moment, safe) loved ones\nknow that you will buy our product no matter what we say. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot waste any more time. Our lawyer has stopped barking.\n\n Buy\nour product.\n\n This\nhas been another word from our sponsors.\n\n Oh,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, listeners. There is a knocking on my studio window. It is\na Man in a Tan Jacket, holding a deerskin suitcase. It is difficult\nto describe his features, as they escape my mind the moment my eyes\nleave his face. He is waving, indicating that he would like to come\nin and speak to me. And, presumably, to all of you.\n\n Umm,\nyeah! Come on in!\n\n [an electrical hum \xe2\x80\x93 at least\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all I remember from this segment]\n\n But\nhow would we even get there? I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of that place. I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember\xe2\x80\xa6what I was just saying. Um, I think someone was just\nspeaking to me, and to all of you out there, about something that\nseemed very important.\nBut now\xe2\x80\xa6now I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember! You all heard him too. Do you\nremember what he said?\n\n No.\nWhy am I sweaty? I think I remember him offering me a note. Or some\npiece of paper, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it, uh, maybe I should have taken it?\n\n I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n Speaking\nof notes, I am being handed another one by Intern Hannah. Hopefully\nit is better than the note she handed me this morning during the\nearlier section of this broadcast. That was such an awful note! I\nmean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you,\nright? So sad, sad and awful. You remember. Also, kind of funny,\nthough. Just a pretty sad, awful, funny note, really.\n\n Um,\nbut this note\xe2\x80\xa6well, it seems that\xe2\x80\xa6no. No, no, no, no!\n\n It\nseems that once again, during this recent bit of missing time, \xe2\x80\x9cbrave\nradio host Cecil Palmer has stepped in and helped Mayor Cardinal\nfight off the sand golem and the Angora rabbits. Cecil, showing\nstrength beyond his stature, held the sand golem down while Dana\nwiped away the writing on its forehead that gave it unnatural life,\ndispersing it to inanimate sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen we just, kind of, shooed the rabbits. They were just rabbits\nand, even in great numbers, were not at all threatening.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nleft the mayor safe, with only a few bumps and bruises and a wrecked\noffice covered in sand that probably will never be completely cleaned\naway \xe2\x80\x93 certainly better than what happened to the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93\nthat poor man.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nbeing told that Mayor Cardinal indicated deep gratitude for my help.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m being told this because I do\nnot remember this!\nBecause, I am certain, now, the owner of Lot 37, the owner\nof Cecil Palmer, once again used me only to protect Dana. That is \xe2\x80\x93\n[exasperated sigh]\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to think about what\nthat is.\n\n But\nfirst, a continuation of our previous Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science\nCorner.\n\n Children,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s now time to go check on those glass vials we prepared earlier in\nthe broadcast. If you mixed everything right, and placed it in a\nwarm, dry place like we told you to, you should be able to now\nobserve the start of the tendrils. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get close to them; those\ntendrils have a strong grip. One could call their grip unbreakable,\nor even poisonous.\n\n You\nmight also hear buzzing. Do you hear buzzing? Listen closely. Science\nis all about observation. Write down what the buzzing sounds like in\ndetail. Draw a graph to show the buzzing. What the buzzing is telling\nyou is that the thing in the vial has marked you as its prey. You\nneed to run.\nOh, you should have started running the moment you heard the buzzing.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, ha-ha, I should have said that before the rest of this\nstuff.\n\n If\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhear anything, then congratulations! You can move on to the second\npart of the experiment. Lay down plastic sheeting in the room, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll be back to give you the full instructions later.\n\n This\nhas been Part 2 of the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n This\nday started bad, and it does not appear to be getting better any time\nsoon. I, however unwillingly and unconsciously, helped the mayor\nfight off her attackers. And yet, even that act was not enough to end\nthis ordeal.\n\n Hiram\nMcDaniels, literal five-headed dragon, and the Faceless Old Woman Who\nSecretly Lives in Your Home, both former mayoral candidates, have\ntaken City Hall once again captive.\n\n Hiram\nis preventing anyone from entering the front door using his massive\nbody, fire breathing, and harsh language.\n\n Mayor\nCardinal has issued a statement through her mouth, shouting out of an\nupper floor window that the Faceless Old Woman is stalking her\nthrough City Hall. Dana can hear bare feet skittering across the\nhallway ceiling, can sense the memory of motion in the air when she\nturns, can feel breath on her neck \xe2\x80\x93 dry and cold, like breath\nnever is.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nhas come for me!\xe2\x80\x9d Dana shouted mayorally. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not be able to\navoid her forever! I will not be able to do anything\nforever!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hiram,\nin response to questions asked by a group of lightly-scorched Secret\nPolice currently trying to taze and arrest him, admitted that he and\nthe Faceless Old Woman have been conspiring against the mayor for\nquite some time. Convincing Pamela Winchell to enter a disastrous\nretirement, staging a blatantly consumerist Christmas display\ninvolving gift cards and an ancient monolith, freeing the antiques\nfrom their pen, funding the dig that led Harrison Kip to find the\nsand golem\xe2\x80\x99s talisman, unsealing and freeing the army of tiny people\nunder Lane 5 of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun\nComplex this morning, working to sabotage the ultimately successful\ndefense led by the Sheriff today against the tiny army, from which\nthe Sheriff miraculously reemerged unscathed. Then, causing the saw\ncyclone that swept through the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office \xe2\x80\x93 not injuring him\nat all, but really\nmessing up his draperies. And then,\nfinally, sending the Sheriff an angry\nletter,\nwhich resulted in the serious paper cut he is currently recovering\nfrom.\n\n And\nnow, all of these measures unsuccessful in removing Dana from power,\nHiram and the Faceless Old Woman have been left with no choice but to\nattack the mayor directly.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cJust\ntry to stop us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hiram. \xe2\x80\x9cJust try.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to see you try, puny mortals!\xe2\x80\x9d roared another one of his\nheads, although\xe2\x80\xa6not the one you\xe2\x80\x99d think.\n\n Well,\ncertainly, I won\xe2\x80\x99t try. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of this mayor-saving\nbusiness. My job is to report, that is what I do, reporting! That is\nwhy they call me what they call me: a journalist! Now, let me report,\nand only\nreport.\n\n We\nare taking all to the weatherrrrrrrrrr\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cHeel\nTurn 2\xe2\x80\x9d by The\nMountain Goats]\n\n Here\nI am, listeners. Whoever I am. Here it is, the me\nthat is whichever me\nI am.\n\n You\ncan guess what happened, I think. Once again, it was brave Cecil who\nsaved the mayor, throwing his body between her and the wrath of the\nFaceless Old Woman and Hiram. It was not an easy fight, and not an\neasy fight for me to remember.\n\n Here\nis what I know: Hiram McDaniels is no longer at City Hall. With my\nhelp, the Secret Police almost apprehended him, but our efforts,\nwhile just enough to prevent his continued siege, were just under\nwhat was needed to capture a literal five-headed dragon. And in the\nscuffle, Hiram disappeared. He could be anywhere. Svitz, Lemuria, the\nSecret Lost Pet City on the Moon, or even still in Night Vale. Even\nthat.\n\n Here\nis what else I know: the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in All\nof Our Homes was unable to complete her malicious plans against our\nmayor, and is now secretly living in all of our homes still. She did\nnot need to change anything in order to hide.\n\n These\ntwo rebels, who are against the mayor rightfully chosen for us by\nforces we do not understand, will not rest quietly. I have no doubt\nof it. I know that there is more coming, as always. This is what I\nknow.\n\n Here\nis what I do not know: the owner of Lot 37. Who bought me at that\nauction and did nothing with their prize for so long, only to now use\nme again, and again, with one purpose, to protect one person: Dana\nCardinal. Mayor Cardinal. My friend.\n\n Here\nis who I do not know, but thought I did: Dana Cardinal. My friend.\nAnd I am starting to fear, and I am starting to doubt the owner of\nLot 37. Could she be? Who else would be so invested in protecting her\nand only\nher? Dana? Is it you? Could it be\xe2\x80\xa6it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\n\n It\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n But\nstill\xe2\x80\xa6but still.\n\n Huh.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for Part 3 and Part 4 and many more parts, each succeeding\nmoment after the one before, and some you will hear and some you will\nnot. And none of them will be true, exactly, but all of them will be\nan honest attempt at the most accurate fiction possible.\n\n Goodnight,\nto our recuperating Sheriff. Goodnight, to a mayor I once thought I\nknew. Goodnight, to Old Woman Josie and the rest of the bowling team.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you at league night.\n\n And\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: History is written by the victors. And then forgotten by the\nvictors. And then the victors die, too.'
