I bring you now to our ongoing coverage of the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day aftermath.\xc2\xa0Emergency workers have been at it since early this morning, starting the long task of cleanup and recovery.\n\n\n Reports are still hazy, but we believe that the housing developments of Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Gorge and Golden Dunes have both been wiped completely off the map, while Coyote Corners and Cactus Bloom are reporting extensive damage to structures and power lines.\n\n\n Please, if you are not directly involved in the recovery and cleanup from Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, stay off the roads to make room for those who are.\n\n\n This Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, as all Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Days, will not succeed in bringing our city down. This Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, as all Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Days, will soon recede into painful memory, fading with time, until another foul Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day is upon us again.\n\n\n In other news, the Randy Newman Memorial Night Vale Airport has announced some schedule changes due to multiple severe weather conditions, including the existence of an atmosphere, and that strange fiery orb that appears for approximately half of every twenty-four hour period. Many of today\xe2\x80\x99s flights will be delayed for several hours while the rest will be moved into the past and will have already happened last week.\n\n\n All arriving flights have been canceled except those from JFK, LAX, and XTA, which will continue on the usual routine of unscheduled arrivals that are a complete surprise to both the pilots and Air Traffic Control \xe2\x80\x93 based on routes that appear to violate the simple laws of physics and geography.\n\n\n In addition, Martin McCaffrey \xe2\x80\x93 local TSA representative \xe2\x80\x93 reminded all travelers that security measures are in place for their own safety, and we should respect the sacrifice needed to keep our lives and our country secure.\n\n\n Martin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know going through both a metal and full-body scanner, as well as crawling through a lengthy pitch-black tunnel while a recording of a monotone male voice lists possible ways of dying are all inconveniences, and I know that many travelers are concerned with privacy issues involving the voice of a small child that comes through strategically placed ceiling grates asking them to name every person they have ever kissed. But these are all necessary evils.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Mister McCaffrey then went on to draw a quick sketch of a strange, elongated, dark figure crawling out of a kitchen refrigerator \xe2\x80\x93 after which he immediately insisted he had no memory of creating the picture and no idea what it could mean.\n\n\n More on this\xe2\x80\xa6eventually. Probably.\n\n\n Hey, here\xe2\x80\x99s a health tip from the greater Night Vale medical community!\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s possible you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to kill it. If it manages to burrow under your skin, stop fighting, because it has already become part of you. Welcome your new bodymate! Listen to what it has to say. And see where the new symbiotic lifestyle takes you!\n\n\n Emergency workers report that the damage from Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day is worse than previously projected. They describe bodies strewn upon the ground, covered in glitter and paper cupids. Entire buildings collapsed, leaving only rubble and chalky candy hearts.\n\n\n And, of course, there is the sad fate of those chosen to be another person\xe2\x80\x99s Valentine. Little can be said to help the families of those unfortunates except that the process is, while exactly as ghastly and excruciating as feared, apparently not as horribly slow and drawn out as it appears to outside observers.\n\n\n As usual, no aid has come our way from either the state or national government. The state House even went so far as to send a formal reply, the entirety of which reads:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSorry\xe2\x80\xa6we can see what you were going for, but maybe we just don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98get\xe2\x80\x99 that kind of thing. Anyway, creative stuff! And have a happy Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Those monsters!\n\n\n If you or anyone you know has any footage or photos of the events of Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, please send them directly into the station so that we may put the images and video on the radio. Thank you, and be safe.\n\n\n The City Council recently moved to name \xe2\x80\x9cdance\xe2\x80\x9d as the official town language. This measure has been met with tense debate and raised voices over the past several weeks.\xc2\xa0Proponents say we need a unified language, as it will save money on municipal signage and documentation \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention bring us together as a community.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe poetry of the human body,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, while quickly pulling in their elbows and turning their bowler hats down over their eyes in an obvious tribute to Bob Fosse, \xe2\x80\x9cmates physical being with mental necessity; a marriage that brings purpose to our quickly rotting living corpses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Opponents say that this move, if voted into law, is discriminatory against the physically handicapped. Also, less than 10% of Night Vale citizens have ever taken a single dance lesson \xe2\x80\x93 let alone achieved lifelong mastery of one of the most ethereal and difficult-to-grasp art forms.\n\n\n One opponent, who asked to remain nameless out of fear of retribution, told us the bill was entirely funded by lobbyists from Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s Little Princesses Dance Studio. \xe2\x80\x9cJust follow the money,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\n Then the anonymous insider\xe2\x80\x99s pupils grew until they eclipsed the whites. Their tongue slid out from their knife gash of a grin, and their hair would not stop graying and growing.\n\n\n A final vote is expected on Tuesday.\n\n\n And now, traffic.\n\n\n A representative from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police, waving vaguely at a map in our studio, said that there are street closures, quote \xe2\x80\x9call over. Just all over the general area,\xe2\x80\x9d the representative said, tapping the edge of the map with two knuckles. \xe2\x80\x9cA bunch of \'em, in\xe2\x80\xa6different places.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n We asked if he could be more specific, and he nodded, but did not say anything more. We tried naming a couple of streets to see if any of them were included on the list of closures, but the representative only replied with a, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeah, I mean\xe2\x80\xa6probably!\xe2\x80\x9d and an ambiguous head waggle to each one. He added that anyone caught on a closed road would be dealt with in the usual manner, and then he winked and gave me a thumbs-up.\n\n\n It is possible he was merely a vagrant who wandered into the studio. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to check his credentials. Just to be safe, though, look out for road closures all over in the general area, listeners. They\xe2\x80\x99re in a bunch of different places\xe2\x80\xa6probably.\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n And now for corrections. We offer the following corrections to previous reports broadcast on Night Vale Community Radio.\n\n\n \n Blue, not green.\n\n\n A low whirring sound was heard only by those to the west of it.\n\n\n The witness\xe2\x80\x99 name was Henry Greggson and not, as we reported, Crystal Souleater.\n\n\n We were feeling, at best, fine\xe2\x80\xa6and not, as we stated on the record, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty good, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n No. No. Do not do what we advised. We were so terribly terribly wrong. If you have done it already, well\xe2\x80\xa6our heart goes out to those who miss you. Please forgive us. Please forgive us!\n\n\n\n This has been corrections.\n\n\n More post-Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day news:\n\n\n The Night Vale Mall\xe2\x80\x99s planned Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day art installation, involving footage of actual beating animal hearts projected on a vivisected teddy bear, was canceled due to the entire mall being flooded with poisonous gas.\n\n\n The gas was described as \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to breathe,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca major cause of death to those who stood in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Mall PR officials expressed regret at the cancellation, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMan!
