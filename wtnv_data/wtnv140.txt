Episode 118 - eGemony, Part 2: “The Cavelands”
b'Time is irrelevant and imaginary.\xc2\xa0 \n\n And yet, somehow it seems we are out of it.\xc2\xa0\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Listeners, I have just returned from an odyssey. As you know, a case of Canadian Club whiskey was hidden in Night Vale over 40 years ago as part of a contest. And now, e-gemonee\xe2\x80\xa6 edge-meny, edge-meny, edgem- eedgemon- e- that tech startup wants it back, so they can drink it and thus drink the soul of Night Vale. It turns out that the alcohol was spirited away by \xe2\x80\x93 oh, ahaha, spirited, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one, Cecil\xe2\x80\xa6 by baristas.\n\n I knew I had to warn them before the corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street teams located them. But that would mean going to a place from which no one has ever returned: the remote Cavelands of the baristas, deep under the Earth, where (Eritrean pourover) drips gently from stalagmites and latte foam rivers froth and bubble in cool stone cracks. We\xe2\x80\x99re all pretty sure the Cavelands are under that crate behind the Ace Hardware, but no one goes down there because of the stench of espresso and the chilling sounds of Carly Simon\xe2\x80\x99s greatest hits CD. \n\n The underground society of the baristas is an insular one, and no outsider has met their king. Did you know that baristas have a king? I mean I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but my niece Janice knows all about which professions have monarchs and which like mm, ride sharing services, only have serpents wearing crowns. Janice still has her barista costume from last year\xe2\x80\x99s careers parade. \n\n So in order to investigate the Cavelands, I cloaked myself carefully in the necessary animal skins, as Janice directed, and slung over my shoulders the ceremonial spiky coffee hammer and the sweater vest with the correct number of arm holes. Janice and I took a quick online course in latte art. Janice was great at it. She made a photorealistic aspledium nidus fern, and I uh, I made a, rock of some kind. \n\n Janice said she knew exactly how to finish my disguise, and she was right. I regarded myself in the Ace Hardware window, and I knew I was meant for that boldest, unruliest, most outlaw of mustaches: the rolly fingers! The final touch of a true barista. Rolly Fingers was the most famous king in barista history, and now every barista grows a long thick mustache that swirls at the ends, just like the former king Rolly. From these curls, baristas often hang sweeteners and spoons for customer service. \n\n I flexed all my facial muscles tight, and within minutes, I had finessed my new thick mustache into lovely coils. It was sunset, the time when all the baristas return to the Ace Hardware parking lot, from their day labor jobs, or as they call them, \xe2\x80\x9cgigs\xe2\x80\x9d throughout greater Night Vale. \n\n My plan was to simply blend among them. Blend [chuckling] oh my god blend, oh Cecil you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it again. And so one by one, I smiled and waved at them, and we teased each other with sprays of hot steam, as is the way of baristas at the end of a long day. There were 10 of us, then 15, then perhaps 20, then 30, then 40, then 100 baristas. Baristas as far as the eye can see. So many baristas, all laughing and scalding each other with joviality. Then a very tall barista, whose animal pelts were dusted in silver, looked at me with suspicion. I put her mind at ease by calling out one of their familiar jokes. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother is so tasteless, she orders her eggs ristretto!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. The barista\xe2\x80\x99s hardened face softened into a laugh and she called out: \xe2\x80\x9cTime to ride!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Our steeds made quick work of the steep mile and a half descent below Ace Hardware. I could hear the faint echoes of Norah Jones, as we passed cuneiform style sketches of French presses on the rocky walls. Once we were in the caves, by the lights of torches dipped in (pinch), the baristas ambled to their bed rolls, their knapsacks, their (bindles), and all around the cave, I could see them unwrapping and dusting off and (-) [0:07:41] their instruments. I saw harmonicas, violins, ocarinas, banjoes, mouth harps, mouth pianos, mouth banjoes, (lip scissors), and those who had nothing to play brought out pots and pans to keep time. And we began \xe2\x80\x93 to sing. \n\n [singing] \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-dreaming of someone whose love is so swee-ee-eet, [echoing] like (\xe2\x80\x93) (cronut), 4000 fee-ee-eet, oh my perfect love gives me endless bli-i-iss, [another voice joining] never wants the wi-fi password without puur-chaa-a-ase I said he never asked for that wi-if password Without a puur-chaa-aase.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n And then, without warning, one of the baristas made a gesture and the rest fell silent. They were all looking at me, listeners. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know our anthem!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I totally do,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I was definitely singing\xe2\x80\xa6 something.\xe2\x80\x9d The baristas closed in on me. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me til I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my coffee! Amirite?\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded. \n\n From the back, I heard a quiet but authoritative snarl. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d The baristas parted, all of them, and in the silence, I heard the shuffling of leather shoes, and I was face to face with the king of the baristas.\n\n Listeners, we are all made up of goodness and not-so-goodness. We have conflicting impulses and we struggle to do right. We care to a lesser or greater extent whether our actions are moral, and if they will strike other people as immoral. This is true for all of us, you and me. Corporeal and otherwise. Everyone. \n\n Except the King of Baristas. When I saw him, I knew immediately he had never once hesitated to do right. How did I know this? Maybe it was his beard, as his beard seemed kind. Or it was the way his eyes, his purple eyes crinkled with empathy. Or it was who the light glinted off his horns. In any case, listeners, he reminded me a little of a buffalo. And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to trust a buffalo. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been waiting for you. And by we I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the royal we, as we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in that, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the royal we that second time either. All of us have been waiting for you, and not one of us believes in the royal we. And I love your mustache sooo much!\xe2\x80\x9d the king added in a baby voice as he pinched my cheek. I explained that I came to the Cavelands for the booze. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that. But first, we need to talk about something more important. Your new sponsor.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur sponsor, you mean money? Did you know it\xe2\x80\x99s available in twenties now?\xe2\x80\x9d He said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not speak to us of the attractiveness of money! Money is cursed! And of course everything that is cursed is attractive, otherwise the curse wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d He said that and I thought it was pretty smart. I mean, all of the cursed objects around the station are really fun to play with. Until an intern gets hurt. Like Gustav the other day, who found radium squish ball from one of our old statin promotions.\n\n Oh, quick aside: to the family of Gustav, he was a distracted intern, and he will be missed.\n\n The king said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many times has a person done something awful and you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why it happened? Only for the reason to be \xe2\x80\x93 money! If there were a drug with the same side effects money has, it would be illegal.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cUm, maybe we can talk about this later?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are eGemony corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street teams heading this way now! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be defenseless against them! They\xe2\x80\x99ll round you up into tech campus relaxation zones and make you play videogames and drink energy shakes and and learn PowerPoint! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be trapped for eternity!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He said, \xe2\x80\x9cOH Cecil. They came already. There was a squadron of them, hideous and flickering shadows with smiles of black fire, driving branded cars with terrible posture. And all of them were cheery and wearing shorts and saying things like \xe2\x80\x9cdevOps\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n I asked if the street teams found what they were looking for. The King of the Baristas said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have taken care of them.\xe2\x80\x9d And with his big hands, his big nimble hands, he reached into the matted animal skins on his chest, and he sorted through necklaces made of tiny bird skulls and Splenda packets. He fished out a thin badge that was embossed with the eGemony logo. It still had the rampant weasels and the cheerfully crossed (\xe2\x80\x93) [0:13:52] mushrooms. But the name, the name on the badge, was ground away. \xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d the King of the Baristas said, \xe2\x80\x9cis all that\xe2\x80\x99s left of them.\xe2\x80\x9d And he let out a little chuckle. If I could grade it on a scale between mirthful and mirthless, it was on the mirthful side of things. But there was also a bit of self-knowledge in it, as if the person chuckling were aware that to completely abandon himself to pleasure was to be unmoored from the realities of existence.\n\n He said the street team had covertly arrived over four years ago, in the dead of night, and worked their way to my desk. They recovered the case of Canadian Club and in celebration they opened a single bottle. They passed it around, and each one drank from it. But when they drank the soul of the time, they became infused with it. by the time each had finished a single sip, they had become a part of this place, and the place had become a part of them. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand, Cecil?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. And I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI get it! Rather than absorbing Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s soul, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s soul absorbed them! So\xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99re all good. Problems always solve themselves. Thank you, King of the Baristas!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n There was an uncomfortably long pause. Every barista was staring silently at me. And I worried that maybe this was a disrespectful way to address the king. I coughed a bit and then tried again with a classic barista joke to lighten the mood. \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother\xe2\x80\x99s so overcome with ennui that she-\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x9cCecil,\xe2\x80\x9d the king interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe, the baristas, are the eGemony corporate prize contest and sweepstakes buzz marketing street team! Once we had become a part of Night Vale, we knew what we had to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOoooooo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to find out! But can I check the weather report just really quick?\xe2\x80\x9d And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSure. Go ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cGlitter\xe2\x80\x9d by Charly Bliss]\n\n The king repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew what we had to do.\xe2\x80\x9d He cackled a bit. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever noticed how, at one point, there were no baristas here, and then suddenly there were many, many baristas? Did it seem strange to you that every caf\xc3\xa9 now had a barista? And every restaurant and market, pawn shop and dry cleaner\xe2\x80\x99s? And how the vacant lots are no longer truly vacant, because they are populated by baristas? Have you noticed baristas at the Antiques Mall, in the DMV, and close to but not in the Dog Park? And the ones who run alongside cars as they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving the highway, to offers drivers shots of espresso? Have you noticed how no new buildings pass the city planning department, unless ther\xe2\x80\x99es a four-foot-by-four-foot space for a barista to stand? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t that strike you as strange? Did it strike you as strange that your choices at any coffee establishment were only espresso, or espresso with a shot of Canadian Club?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The king said to me, wisely, carefully, giddily: \xe2\x80\x9cCecil. After being absorbed in the soul of Night Vale, we knew we needed to save our city. So we served it to you. We served Night Vale, its own soul. Night Vale has drunk itself, and in the process become as much itself as any town could ever be. \n\n By then, the sun was starting to rise, and some of the baristas had settled down and were cuddling and grooming each other in their little barista beds, as the fire in the cave was now turning to embers, and there were small ashes flittering like moths around the sierra cups and chemex graphs and wind-powered aeropresses that cluttered every surface.\xc2\xa0\n\n I felt relief knowing the baristas were safe. And also confusion, knowing they had once been a tech company social influence marketing effort. But also, civic pride, as Night Vale is darned good at defending itself against people who want to steal and drink our souls. But also itchiness, because of the animal pelts and long twirly mustache.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe time of worry isn\xe2\x80\x99t over, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d the king said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, it is only beginning. eGemony won\xe2\x80\x99t care that Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s soul is safe. They\xe2\x80\x99ll send another street team and another, until they\xe2\x80\x99ve figured out how to distill our souls. And do you know why, Cecil? It\xe2\x80\x99s because of \xe2\x80\x93 money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Listeners, this is terrible news! Mostly because I really don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear bad things said about our station\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil, we need you to renounce money as a sponsor. Do you know what\xe2\x80\x99s more important than money? We do. We have taken steps this night, while you were here, your show is now sponsored not by but by \xe2\x80\x93 love. Love is the way forward against eGemony!\xe2\x80\x9d I said \xe2\x80\x9cUh huh,\xe2\x80\x9d but I said it with skepticism, like exactly the way a cashier would if someone were about to buy something clutching a handful of love. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x9csuuuure,\xe2\x80\x9d but like really sarcastically like you do after a poetry reading. \n\n He said: \xe2\x80\x9cYour battle is not yet over. eGemony wants that case of Canadian Club, even if it no longer exists. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to use every one of their tools. They\xe2\x80\x99ll use violence, intimidation, social media, dreamfluencing, viral marketing, even science! They will win, unless you figure out a way to repel them!\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cUm pardon me, did you say that they\xe2\x80\x99ll use science?\xe2\x80\x9d And he thought about it and agreed that he had at some point said that. Science, he said, was one of eGemony\xe2\x80\x99s mightiest weapons, and the King of the Baristas said that he wished he knew of some way to fight against it. As soon as he said, I stood to my full height, which is one third taller than my three-quarters height. Listeners, I must admit I was moved enough to actually put my hands by my hips, and my hands were fists, listeners. fists! And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know how to fight back. There is only one weapon mightier than science, and that is \xe2\x80\x93 more science.\xe2\x80\x9d And the king looked at me with amazement, as if I had unsuspected depths, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know science?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Do I, listeners, do I? \n\n Next time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer that question, but spoiler alert: gosh, heck yeah, of course.\n\n Stay tuned next for Adolescent X-team Karate Bedbugs, the show your grandma thinks you like, because she never understood you.\n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Why would you wanna think outside the box? The box is steel and locked and buried deeply underground. It\xe2\x80\x99s so safe here. Why would you want to leave?'
