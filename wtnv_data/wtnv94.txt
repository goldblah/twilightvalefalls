Episode 80 - A New Sheriff in Town
b'I fought the law, and the law won. I\nignored the law, and the law won. I abided by the law, and the law\nwon.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s a new sheriff in town, Night\nVale. The former sheriff, whose name we never knew, whose face we\nnever saw, and whose voice was only ever heard through a vocoder, is\ngone. Our former sheriff was secretive, reclusive, really into\nclassical music, and kleptocracy, rarely made public appearances,\nand, when he did, it was with a balaclava and cape.\n\n The new\nsheriff has a more public persona, refusing to wear the traditional\nmask or cape, and actually allowing their first name to be known\n(it\xe2\x80\x99s Sam, by the way).\n\n The\nsheriff called a press conference this morning to announce that they\nare taking over the Secret Police, effective immediately.\n\n More\non this story as it develops. But first, an editorial.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe holidays, Night Vale. I know many of you will get to spend this\ntime with people you love. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing some eggnog with my\ndearest family: Carlos, Abby, Janice\xe2\x80\xa6others.\n\n But,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s not forget those people who quietly make our lives better. The\npostal carriers, the baristas and food servers, cab drivers, and the\nagents from a Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency who sit outside\nour homes, night after night, recording all of our conversations and\nactivities. Think how boring a job domestic espionage must be. They\nare out there at all hours. Do they ever get to sleep? Or spend\nholidays with families? Or take vacations? Who even knows?\n\n So,\nthe other day, swept up in the holiday spirit, I took some delicious\npfeffernuesse\ncookies out to the windowless van across from my home, and gave\nthem to the agent sitting in the back. Her name is Monica Barnwell,\nand she was just a lovely person. She appreciated that I recognized\nall the hard work she has put in the last several years surveilling\nme, and I thanked her for her service to our community.\n\n We\nhad some small talk, and then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, gotta get back to my\ndull life!\xe2\x80\x9d as I looked down at my shoes.\n\n She\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Cecil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMonica, would you like me to\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow\xe2\x80\xa6question the world government, or be more anti-war, or talk\nmore like a political dissonant, or something? Just to make your day\na little more exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99d be so fun, Cecil, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n Then\nI went back inside and told my boyfriend I wanted to get a beret.\nEither red or camouflage.\n\n So\nNight Vale, this holiday season, think about all the people you may\ntake for granted. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give them a gift or anything;\njust a thank you, and a smile for all their hard work is enough. And,\nif you have any particularly juicy secrets, consider brightening some\nagent\xe2\x80\x99s day by announcing them in a loud, clear voice to the nearest\nhidden microphone in your home.\n\n The\nnew sheriff has spoken. They opened their press conference with the\nfollowing statement:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCitizens\nof Night Vale, we have a crisis on our hands, and that crisis is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nthe sheriff performed a ten-minute modern dance piece, set to music\nby Steve Reich (of course), that frantically yet lyrically conveyed a\ndisdain for the fiscal irresponsibility of current mayor Dana\nCardinal.\n\n The\npress corps loved the piece, especially its subtle tribute to\nchoreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping repetitive style,\neven though the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s muscular, longitudinal movements obviously\nindicated heavy training in Lester Horton\xe2\x80\x99s methodology. They\napplauded politely, and the sheriff continued with their speech.\nQuote:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOur\nSecret Police force has been secretly requesting budget increases to\nhelp cover overtime and new equipment. Maybe you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d the sheriff said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it, you know, secret and all. But\nwe were requesting it, secretly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t print that! It\xe2\x80\x99s a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nsheriff went on.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cInstead,\nthe mayor has decided to use our\nmoney to help the citizens of our unfriendly neighboring town, Desert\nBluffs. We will not only see a rise in crime, because we have a mayor\nwho decided to disrupt our stable economy, but we will also face a\nlack of financial ability to effectively stop this crime.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill secretly undermine the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s authority, with the help of the\nCity Council and some lizard people I know, to keep Night Vale\n\xe2\x80\x99safe.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey!\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t report my finger-quotes around the word \xe2\x80\x98safe.\xe2\x80\x99\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re secret!\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis my promise to you, as your new sheriff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n One\nreporter then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cUmm, what happened to the old sheriff?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nnew sheriff responded by painting a canvas entirely blue.\n\n More\non this story, but first, an update on the trial of the century.\n\n Judge\nSiobhan Azdaq has brought in a computer programmer named Melony\nPennington to develop the first-ever all-A.I. Jury for the trial of\nHiram McDaniels. Attorneys have had a difficult time finding a jury\nof peers for McDaniels, as he is literally\na five-headed dragon and, outside of his family, seems to be the only\none of his kind in the area. Not knowing how to find actual dragons\nto serve on the jury, and not willing to have a five-headed dragon\nunfairly juried by all humans, judge Azdaq called for science to\nsolve this problem. Because, according to Azdaq, science has solved\nevery other problem.\n\n Both\nthe prosecuting attorney, Troy Walsh, and the court-appointed defense\nattorney, also named Troy Walsh, agreed that this is a fair solution,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand artificial intelligence is probably a thing anyone with a\nMacbook and some Red Bull has already mastered, like, years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey said in unison, with identical smiles and matching haircuts.\n\n Pennington\nhas been working with young computer prodigy, Meghan Wallaby, who is\nan 11-year-old girl who inhabits what once was the body of a Russian\nsailor, and also was only born three years ago. But then, the\nspecifics of her identity and her manifestation within time are\nreally none of your business.\n\n Wallaby\nis helping Pennington engineer a sentient program that can think\nexactly like six different five-headed dragons. Meghan has had a real\naffinity for computers ever since the\xe2\x80\xa6uh, the incident\nin the school gym that one time.\n\n The\nother members of the jury will be humans. Auditions for those jury\nslots will be conducted Wednesday at the Night Vale Community\nTheater.\n\n Four\nof Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s five heads are being brought up on charges of conspiracy\nand attempted murder of our mayor. The fifth head, the violet one, is\nbeing courted as a key witness by the prosecution, but they\xe2\x80\x99re having\na difficult time getting a private conversation with it.\n\n The\ntrial is scheduled for early next year.\n\n Oh,\nby the way, listeners, I ran into former station intern Maureen! I\nactually didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice her at first, as I was listening to an album I\njust got. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new musical about Alexander Hamilton, who became our\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s fourth president because he successfully killed former vice\npresident Aaron Burr in a duel.\n\n Anyway,\nthe soundtrack\nis fantastic, and I was totally engrossed in my lip syncing and\nself-styled choreography when I saw Maureen waving to me from down\nthe street. I saw she was with someone, but his baseball hat was\npulled down over his face, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a good look at him.\n\n Maureen\nthen asked me for a letter stating she\xe2\x80\x99d completed her internship,\nbecause she needed those two credits for college. I reminded her she\nspent most of her internship flickering in and out of existence,\nso\xe2\x80\xa6I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write the letter. But, I was really excited to see\nshe was dating someone.\n\n Then\nshe said something about not assuming people are dating just because\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re hanging out, blah blah blah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even like boys, blah\nblah, but I kept staring at the boy in the ball cap, and I did not\nlike him one bit. I felt like I knew him from somewhere, but I\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put my finger on where.\n\n Oh,\nwell. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t come up again.\n\n I\ntold Maureen it was a good thing she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into boys, because this\none seemed like bad news.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cReally\nbad news,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered, and Maureen groaned and rolled her eyes in\nwhat I assume was agreement.\n\n Then\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood seeing you!\xe2\x80\x9d and walked away.\n\n She\nshouted, \xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my credit letter?\xe2\x80\x9d while\nwaving her fist and cussing, which is (I guess) how kids today say\n\xe2\x80\x9cgoodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Oh,\nlisteners! I need to make an apology. Earlier in today\xe2\x80\x99s show, I\nmentioned giving some cookies to the agent from a Vague, Yet\nMenacing, Government Agency, and in the process I revealed her full\nname as Monica Barnwell,\nand the location of her operation as in front of my home.\nBecause of this security breach, Monica has apparently lost her job\nas a secret agent and had to go into hiding for the rest of her life,\nchanging her looks and identity, and never seeing her family or\nfriends again.\n\n Really\nsorry about that one, Monica.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a look at traffic. What do you say?\n\n Feet\napart, toes together. Right foot turned 45 degrees. No need for\nmathematical precision, but if you have a protractor, break it into\npieces and swallow it. Absorb its numbers like nutrients. Bend your\nknees. Bend other things that allow for bending. Do not force\nmalleability.\n\n That\nright foot, though? What\xe2\x80\x99s it doing? Did you move your foot?\n\n Memories\naren\xe2\x80\x99t real.\n\n Do\nyou control your self? Not if you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember being in control.\nMaybe we pretend to have experienced things so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\nactually understand why they happened.\n\n Your\nfoot is flexing now. Why? What silent siren\xe2\x80\x99s song calls your right\nfoot?\n\n You\nare sitting. You are passive, still.\n\n Your\nleft foot idles in the dark, complacent and obedient.\n\n Your\nright foot serves a greater god. It flexes for its idol, all plastic\nand steel, and full of fire and fumes. Your right foot wishes for you\nto pray with a clear mind, and open eyes.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n And\nnow an update on the new sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s press conference.\n\n The\nsheriff announced that while they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything about the\nmoney the mayor has already wasted on neighboring towns, the Secret\nPolice would certainly make it clear to anyone from Desert Bluffs who\nmight be trying to enter Night Vale that they would not be wanted.\n\n The\nsheriff announced a plan to tag all Desert Bluffs citizens with\nbright orange hats that have the word \xe2\x80\x9cUNWANTED\xe2\x80\x9d written in\nblinking L.E.D. lights across the front.\n\n As\nthe sheriff said this, several journalists shifted uncomfortably in\ntheir seats. This is because their seats were uncomfortable, but they\nstill nodded excitedly about the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s cool new idea.\n\n One\njournalist pointed out, though, that the orange hat thing would be an\nadded expense, what with having to print up hats and design the\nL.E.D.s and all that. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this whole press conference seems to be\nabout our city\xe2\x80\x99s lack of funding for new projects,\xe2\x80\x9d the journalist\nsaid.\n\n In\nthe tense silence that followed, the journalist added, \xe2\x80\x9cPlus,\neveryone from Desert Bluffs is pretty easy to identify, what with all\nthe blood on their sh\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n But\nthen the reporter was helpfully tackled and muzzled by the other\nreporters who did not want to get off on the wrong foot with the new\nsheriff.\n\n As\nthe great television news man Edward R. Murrow once said, \xe2\x80\x9cHey,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t rock the boat, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n In\nthe commotion, no one seemed to notice the appearance of several\nstrangers, standing around the perimeter of the conference room. Our\nnew station intern Kareem was there, and claimed the strangers really\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t appear so much\nas seemed to have always been there,\neven though he was positive they were not there at the start.\n\n They\nwere completely still, except for their breathing. They were\ndefinitely breathing. And everyone heard it.\n\n No\none knew what the strangers wanted, but they were certain it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\ngood.\n\n The\nmembers of the press stepped backward into the middle of the room.\nThey waited. And from the silence came a noise. There came a\nsudden\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Oh.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost 20 past the hour, listeners. I had better get to the\nweather report. Here you go.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cShe\nKnows\xe2\x80\x9d by John\nFullbright]\n\n Where\nwas I? Ah, a-ha.\n\n They\nwaited. From the silence came a noise. Then there came a sudden\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n OK,\nyeah. Basically, everyone was quiet until a reporter asked the\nsheriff, \xe2\x80\x9cWho are these people? Will the Secret Police protect us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nsheriff did not respond. It was quiet, save for the strangers\xe2\x80\x99\nbreathing for about three minutes.\n\n Then\nthe questions and cries came in increasing volume and pace, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\nare these people? Sheriff, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t the moving? What do they want?\nHas anyone seen my phone? We\xe2\x80\x99re going to die!\xe2\x80\x9d Et cetera.\n\n Eventually\nthe room devolved into panic, members of the press shoving to get\nout, but in a way that suggested that the exit was through\neach other.\n\n Then\nthe sheriff raised their hand, and announced into the microphone,\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n No\none believed the sheriff, and the sheriff, knowing this, rephrased\nthe statement.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSome\nthings are not fine, but other things are fine! This,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand here, the sheriff indicated the whole room, \xe2\x80\x9cis probably fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\npanicked reporters were now filled with both fear and doubt. The\nsheriff stood, stupefied, as a single bead of sweat rolled down their\nbrow, along the nose, forming a thin wet crack across their entire\nface. No one breathed. Except the strangers, of course, who, by the\ntime the droplet had completed its erratic journey, were somehow\nseveral feet closer to the press corps \xe2\x80\x93 despite never having\nvisibly moved an inch.\n\n Everyone\nin the room, including the sheriff, knew that death was upon them.\nNone of them were afraid of death. They were, instead, terrified of\nwhat would come immediately before,\nand immediately after,\ndeath.\n\n Listeners,\nlike I said earlier, our own intern Kareem was part of that press\ncorps today. So, to the family of intern Kareem, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good intern.\nAnd is doing great work. He got back from the press conference a\nlittle bit ago saying he had a great time, and he also provided some\nexcellent reporting.\n\n According\nto Kareem, the strangers encroached slowly on the remaining\njournalists, moving without seeming to move. No one could look the\nstrangers in the eye. They did not know what the strangers wanted of\nthem, just that their lives were likely over. Kareem said he heard\nsomeone crying, another person frantically chanting, and he was\ntrying to take it all in.\n\n But\nthen he heard a flapping of wings, like a pteranodon or a librarian.\nAnd, looking up, he saw a flash of blackness and long feathered\ncreatures descending from a dark sky. And the next thing he knew, he\nwas back at the radio station, safely interning once again.\n\n Kareem\ncalled the creatures that saved everyone \xe2\x80\x9cangels,\xe2\x80\x9d but I reminded\nhim that there is no such thing, and according to the A.P.\nStyle Guide, it is illegal to acknowledge the existence of\nangels, so this is what\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Oh.\n\n [Cecil clears his throat]\n\n Uh,\nKareem is now trying to argue with me about the fluidity of\nvernacular and the constant evolution of language.\n\n Ugh.\nOkay.\n\n All\nright, listeners, I need to deal with this.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the real life actualization of that dream you had last\nTuesday. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make a cute couple, so congratulations!\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: There are hot\nsingles in your area, and they all died exactly 20 years ago, on a\nnight just like tonight.'
