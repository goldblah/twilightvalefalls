Episode 78 - Cooking Stuff: Thanksgiving Special
b"Cook a feast no family could fully\neat, recite prayers no family could fully believe, and acknowledge a\nfrightful history no family could fully comprehend.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Cecil: We have a treat for you\ntoday, Night Vale: a Thanksgiving edition of Cooking Stuff with Earl\nHarlan. Our guest, of course, is Earl Harlan, sous chef at Night\nVale\xe2\x80\x99s most celebrated restaurant, Tourniquet. Thanks for being here,\nEarl!\n\n Earl: Thanks for having me on,\nCecil.\n\n Cecil: Earl\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\ntalking us through preparing and cooking a basic Thanksgiving meal. I\nknow a lot of you out there have your ancient family recipes, still\non their original cave walls, but Earl might have some new techniques\nto help you spice up those old dishes, and there are a lot of people\n\xe2\x80\x93 like Carlos and me \xe2\x80\x93 who have never cooked (or even seen)\na Thanksgiving turkey. It\xe2\x80\x99s intimidating!\n\n Where do we\nbegin, Earl?\n\n Earl:\nWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be intimidating. On today\xe2\x80\x99s show I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk\nyou through the five easy steps for the perfect Thanksgiving turkey \xe2\x80\x93\nkill, clean, gut, stuff, and cook \xe2\x80\x93 also some essential dishes like\nmashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.\n\n Cecil:\nThat sounds great, Earl! But, before we get started, let\xe2\x80\x99s get a news\nupdate about the trial of Hiram McDaniels.\n\n Things are coming\nalong in Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s trial of the century. Judge Siobhan Azdaq has\nbeen assigned this case. Siobhan is not actually a judge, she\xe2\x80\x99s the\ntheater writer for the Night Vale Daily Journal. But, given that\nNight Vale has never had a trial, we just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many judges\naround.\n\n Since Siobhan has\nsuch a nuanced understanding of contemporary stage craft, but with an\nacerbic and unforgiving critical voice, she seemed a pretty good fit\nfor deciding the fates of likely criminals \xe2\x80\x93 which is who she\xe2\x80\x99d be\ndealing with. I mean, what innocent person gets arrested and brought\nto trial? Ha! No innocent person I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of! Ha-ha!\n\n [Cecil clears his throat]\n\n Hiram McDaniels,\na literal five-headed dragon, has been charged with the attempted\nmurder of current mayor Dana Cardinal, as well as conspiracy,\nassault, and willful destruction of private property.\n\n The\ntrail will be held just as soon as they can find a jury of Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\npeers. So far, they have found a salamander. But it\xe2\x80\x99s tiny. And\ncannot speak human languages. Let alone hold still long enough to\nlisten to the lawyers discuss jury selections. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s an\namphibian, not a\nreptile, so\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty insensitive.\n\n They\ndid find another\nfive-headed dragon available to serve on a jury, but it turns out she\nis Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Hadassah, and she was none too happy to be called\nin for jury duty, let alone at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s trial.\n\n The\nprosecuting attorney, Troy Walsh, has been toying around with the\nidea of just\xe2\x80\xa6dressing people up like dragons, so that Hiram feels\nlike he\xe2\x80\x99s getting a fair trial. This seems the most equitable thing\nto do, since everyone knows that justice is less about what the law\nsays, and more about\nhow everyone feels\nabout it.\n\n More on the trial\nof the century as events develop.\n\n Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s get\nright back to Cooking Stuff with Earl Harlan.\n\n Earl:\nThanks, Cecil! So, let\xe2\x80\x99s cook a turkey!\n\n First step: find\na turkey and kill it.\n\n Cecil:Yum!\n\n Earl:\nI shot mine, but you could use a knife, a bow and arrow, a heavy\nwrench, your teeth\xe2\x80\xa6whatever\xe2\x80\x99s easiest for you.\n\n The next step is\nto clean your bird. Pluck all of the feathers from its lifeless\ncorpse. Cut off its head, and all six of its hooves.\n\n Now, adventurist\nculinary experts out there could pickle those hooves and serve them\nwith ice cream for a traditional Svitzish dessert.\n\n Next, gut the\nturkey, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be intimidated by the stench. Just stick your knife\ndeep into its belly and allow everything to pour out onto the floor.\nYou won\xe2\x80\x99t need any of that mess.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, my mother used to actually cook turkey organs for us. She said\nthey were called giblets.\n\n Earl:\nOh, your mother lied to you, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nThen what was she feeding us?\n\n Earl:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s stuff this turkey! What do you say?\n\n Cecil: Okay!\n\n Earl:\nI used to make my stuffing from stale bread, but since wheat &amp;\nwheat by-products can turn into snakes and kill you, I just take old\nnewspapers, wad them up, and shove them into the turkey. They absorb\nmost of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s toxic fluids, so\xe2\x80\xa6same result, really.\n\n After the\nstuffing, throw in some seasoning like salt and pepper, thyme, sage,\na fistful of grass\xe2\x80\xa6anything you find lying around. Just put it in a\npile on top of the turkey, and slide it into the oven.\n\n While you\xe2\x80\x99re\nwaiting for it to cook, maybe catch a football game on television. I\nplan on watching some games this year with my son Roger. Last\nThanksgiving we watched football together, but at the time I had just\ncome into awareness of myself as an adult, and suddenly had this son\nthat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at all, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know his name. It was awkward.\n\n Plus, neither of\nus had heard of football, let alone its byzantine laws and\nrestrictions on dancing.\n\n We both sat\nsilently, waiting for it to be over, wanting to speak to each other,\nunable to find the words.\n\n Cecil:\nNot talking can be a blessing, Earl! Well, Thanksgiving football\ngames are my favorite, because my brother-in-law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me\nfor hours.\n\n Carlos likes\nwatching the big parade, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t deal well with gore so I cover\nmy eyes and have him describe to me how they all die.\n\n Earl: I\xe2\x80\x99m\ntrying to build family traditions with Roger. Trying to build\nanything with Roger.\n\n Cecil:\nFun. And, hey! I remembered to rent an oven for your appearance this\ntime, Earl!\n\n Now, you already\nprepared our turkey before the broadcast today. It\xe2\x80\x99s cooking right\nnow, low and slow at 675\xc2\xba. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to taste it!\n\n But first, a\npublic service announcement:\n\n The\nNight Vale Parks Department would like to remind you that bears are\ndangerous animals, and you should stay away from them.\n\n Conversely, bears\nare also adorable! So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to want to stay too far away.\n\n The\nNight Vale Parks Department understands bears look like they want\nhugs, and maybe they do\nwant hugs! Maybe a hug would be just the thing to calm down their\naggressive side. Who knows? In fact, the rangers over at the Parks\nDepartment are split right down the middle as to whether bears are\ndangerous or cute.\n\n According to the\nnew Parks Department brochure on wilderness safety, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough to\nsay. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, try hugging a bear, see what happens!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Earl:\nWhat a weird brochure. Bears are dangerous animals, Cecil. No one\nshould ever hug\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s not argue, Earl!\n\n This has been a\npublic service announcement created by the Night Vale Parks\nDepartment, and paid for by a bunch of bears that pooled their money\nand bought some air time.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk now\nabout the ultimate Thanksgiving side, mashed potatoes!\n\n Earl:\nRight. Mashed potatoes are a simple dish in concept, but they take\nskill to master. A lot of people think they only need to mix\npotatoes, stock, butter, and cream, but there\xe2\x80\x99s so much more to it\nthan that!\n\n Cecil:\nReally? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using that standard recipe for years. It seems\nfine.\n\n Earl:\nOh, but Cecil, it could be so much better!\nFor instance, you could cook\nthose potatoes for about 45 to 60 minutes to really soften them up. A\nraw potato is quite hard to mash, let alone chew.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I never thought about that!\n\n Earl:\nPeople also forget to take the butter out of its wax paper or foil\nwrapping. You should definitely unwrap your butter before using it.\nAlso, make sure your cream is fresh. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use any heavy\ncream older than, say, six months.\n\n Cecil:\nAmazing! I would have never thought of any\nof this!\n\n Earl:\nAnd listen, salt and pepper are fine for mashed potato seasoning, but\nif you really want to step your dish up a notch, really\nhave your family clamoring about your kitchen skills, then let me\ntell you my secret spice mix.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat is it, Earl?\n\n Earl:\nI used slightly more salt, and a little extra pepper. Just a tad.\n\n Cecil:\nAmazing!\n\n Earl:\nThen you just put it on a pot and mash it with your feet until it\xe2\x80\x99s\nwarm enough to serve.\n\n You know, I\nrecently made this dish for me and Roger.\n\n Cecil:\nDid he love it?\n\n Earl:\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. He ate it, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, um\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And then I said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And he went to\nbed.\n\n Cecil:\nAw. How sweet.\n\n Earl:\nLately I noticed he wakes up in the middle of the night and just\nwalks. I got up quietly and followed him one night. He walked out of\nthe house, and into the neighborhood. He walked down each street in\nour subdivision, never backtracking or walking the same street twice.\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop or look at anything. He just walked in the darkness.\n\n Once a hooded\nfigure passed him, but neither of them acknowledged each other. The\nhooded figure saw me for sure, but I think they also saw that I was\njust a concerned father, and was not interested in spying on any of\ntheir secretive activities. The hooded figure nodded and let me pass.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd Roger\xe2\x80\xa6came home after that?\n\n Earl:\nYep. He walks each street, each night in a different pattern, and\nthen returns to bed.\n\n Cecil:\nQuite an adventurous kiddo you have there!\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s pause now\nfor a word from today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor. With that, here\xe2\x80\x99s Deb, a sentient\npatch of haze.\n\n Deb:\nHello, human listeners. Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is proudly sponsored by corn.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost Thanksgiving, after all, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nThanksgiving without corn.\n\n Thanksgiving is\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s holiday. Corn is America\xe2\x80\x99s crop. America\xe2\x80\x99s life blood. You\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live without corn! If we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have corn, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\ntortillas, or syrup, or soft drinks. Without corn, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\ndogs, or cars! We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a moon. Everything is made of\ncorn!\n\n Listen to your\nheartbeat. \xe2\x80\x9cZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzph!\xe2\x80\x9d You hear that heartbeat of yours?\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a patch of haze, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a heartbeat sounds like. But\nthis is what I imagine it sounds like. \xe2\x80\x9cZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzph!\xe2\x80\x9d That\nsound in your chest is corn, my friend. All that corn, pumping\nthrough your delicate mortal veins.\n\n You didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose\nhow ya got here. Neither did corn. You are both products of free\nmarket and overpopulation.\n\n Corn. Eat it.\n\n This message is\nbrought to you by the Corn and Imaginary Corn Farmers of America.\n\n Cecil:\nThanks, Deb!\n\n Earl:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really humid in here!\n\n Cecil:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s Deb for you!\n\n Well, speaking of\ncorn, that brings us to my favorite Thanksgiving dish, cranberry\nsauce!\n\n Earl:\nA lot of people look down on canned cranberry sauce, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be so\nquick to judge! It\xe2\x80\x99s inexpensive, easy to store, and \xe2\x80\x93 with the\nright preparation \xe2\x80\x93 you can elevate this plain can of red gelatin\ninto the most talked-about dish on the table.\n\n Cecil:\nGreat news! I have an entire cupboard full of canned cranberry sauce.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to hearing what I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to do with it.\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6Earl?\n\n Earl:\nI found Roger one evening in the cupboard. He was just sitting there.\nHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hiding, or crying.\n\n I asked him what\nhe was doing and he shrugged his shoulders. I asked if he was all\nright, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nTell me, how is he doing in school?\n\n Earl:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been up and down. There\xe2\x80\x99s no record of his birth, or his\nexistence prior to\nlast Fall. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any birth mother, and he has no memories\nprior to showing up at my house for the first time a little over a\nyear ago.\n\n The\nschool has let him enroll and take classes despite his lack of\npaperwork. He gets along with most kids okay\xe2\x80\xa6but some tease him.\nThey call him names like \xe2\x80\x9cGhost Child\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cZombie Kid\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause his skin is grayish and decaying, and he is\nnearly transparent.\n\n Cecil:\nOuch. Kids can be cruel.\n\n Earl:\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s really good in\nclass, though! He\xe2\x80\x99s still in elementary school because he looks about\neight or nine, but his teacher Ms. Blackwell says he has adult-level\nreading and math skills, so we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get him more advanced\nmaterial. He\xe2\x80\x99s been reading Emmanuel Kant for a book report.\n\n Cecil:\nRoger\xe2\x80\x99s such a bright kid. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good father, Earl. You know that,\nright?\n\n Earl: I\nhave no idea what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, Cecil. I try to talk to him but he\nseems\xe2\x80\xa6distant? Bored? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n Cecil:\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a child. It's\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. I imagine. For what is\nessentially an adopted child to\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Earl: He\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot\nadopted, though! He looks just like me, Cecil! See? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a photo of\nhim, and here\xe2\x80\x99s one of me when I was a child.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, wow! You two are\nidentical! When was this photo taken of you? Is\xe2\x80\xa6is that a steam\nlocomotive in the back\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Earl:\nAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\nFIRE!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, my! Listeners, it appears our oven has caught fire.\n\n [Cecil\ncoughs]\n\n Earl:\nHere! Here!\n\n [Cecil coughs\nseveral more times]\n\n Cecil:\nWhere are\nyou?\n\n [Cecil coughs\nagain]\n\n \nEarl?\n\n \nOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much smoke!\n\n \nListeners, while I find Earl, let me take you all\n\n [Cecil coughs\nyet again]\n\n \n\xe2\x80\xa6to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cAutumn\xe2\x80\x99s\nEcho\xe2\x80\x9d by Stripmall\nArchitecture]\n\n Cecil:\nWell, our turkey has finished cooking, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out a whole\nThanksgiving spread for us here, Earl. It looks delectable!\n\n Earl:\nYeah, the turkey came out perfectly!\nOnce the oven catches fire, that\xe2\x80\x99s when you know it\xe2\x80\x99s time to take\nout your bird and dig in.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, oh! Let me start by tasting the cranberry sauce.\n\n Mmmmmmm!\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so\ngood!\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s got that perfect balance of tart and sugary sweetness I like,\nplus the crunch of the frozen corn mixed in just gives this gooey\ndish a delightfully complex texture.\n\n Earl:\nI also recommend mixing in a handful of bay leaves at the end.\n\n Cecil:\nYum!\n\n \nAnd now let\xe2\x80\x99s try these Earl Harlan special mashed potatoes.\n\n \nMmmmmm! So buttery and warm! Like the skin on the bottom of a human\nfoot.\n\n Earl:\nAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget my secret spice mix!\n\n Cecil:\nOh-ho! I\xe2\x80\x99ve already forgotten.\n\n \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s move on to the crown jewel of Thanksgiving dinner, the turkey.\nTell us about this masterpiece, Earl.\n\n Earl:\nTurkey is easier than you think, listeners. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be intimidated! I\nshot this bird, drained its blood, tore all of its feathers off,\nremoved its organs, and cut off its head and feet. Then, I stuffed\nthings into its dead body, and put it in an oven.\n\n Cecil:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s give it a taste.\n\n [Cecil chews]\n\n \nMmmmm!\n\n [Cecil chews]\n\n \nSo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Cecil chews]\n\n \nOh\xe2\x80\xa6okay\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nHuh.\n\n Earl:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s so nice of you to say, Cecil!\n\n This\nshow has meant a lot to me today. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a tough\xe2\x80\xa6well, a\ncomplicated\nyear. And cooking, cooking has brought me so much joy\xe2\x80\xa6well,\ndistraction.\n\n \nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a real pleasure getting to spend time with you and your\nlisteners.\n\n Cecil:\nEarl? Come over to our place for Thanksgiving.\n\n Earl:\nI\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \nNo.\n\n Cecil:\nYes! Please! Carlos and I would love to have you and Roger\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Earl:\nWho?\n\n Cecil:\nYour son?\n\n Earl:\nRight.\nRight!\n\n Cecil:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99d love to have you two over. My sister and her husband are coming,\nplus my niece Janice will be there, so that would be someone Roger\ncould talk to and play with!\n\n Earl:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to intrude. Can you even fit that many people?\n\n Cecil:\nOh, of course! Plus, Carlos and I will do the cooking. No working for\nyou this holiday!\n\n Earl:\nCecil, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say!\n\n Cecil:\nWell, actually we might need a hand with the cranberry sauce. I have\nover 20 cans of the stuff I need to prepare.\n\n \nBut, other than that, you and Roger just sit back and try to\nunderstand the point of football. Maybe even have Carlos describe the\ntorture scenes from the parade to you both? Eek!\n\n \nOh! Keep Steve occupied and out of the kitchen while I\xe2\x80\x99m cooking!\n\n Earl:\nThank you, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\n\n Ah!\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to try out all these new recipes. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go out and\nassassinate a turkey right after the broadcast today, I\xe2\x80\x99m that\nexcited!\n\n \nListeners, thanks again for tuning in and thanks to Earl Harlan of\nthe restaurant Tourniquet for these helpful cooking tips!\n\n \nStay tuned next for a nearly-exact repeat of this same show, but with\nthe addition of one extra word that changes the meaning of\neverything.\n\n \nAnd as always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: If a car flashes its brights at you, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a gang.\nAnd if you flash your brights back, the gang gives you cake. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\ncake gang."
