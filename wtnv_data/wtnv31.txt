Episode 30 - Dana
b'It takes heart. It takes guts. It also takes cash. It just needs your payment immediately.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Mayor Pamela Winchell announced again today that she is stepping down as mayor later this year. This is the fourth announcement this week. She said again, through tight teeth, that this is totally her call and was never ever discussed in a room with no windows, by small men wearing large pelts and decorative soft meat crowns.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not how we do things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not how we do things,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not how we do things!\xe2\x80\x9d she mouthed silently, as a single dark red tear formed in the corner of her eye, and then slowly rolled down her taut olive cheek and onto her clay-stained smock.\n\n\n Elections for a new mayor will be held at some later time. When asked by the press for a specific date and location, masked representatives from A Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency purred loudly. They then began rubbing their sides against the journalists\xe2\x80\x99 legs. Several reporters began sneezing.\n\n\n Listeners, many of you recall our station intern Dana who, while reporting on strange goings-on, was locked in the Forbidden Dog Park back in April. I\xe2\x80\x99ve received occasional texts and emails from Dana, but then this morning, well\xe2\x80\xa6let\xe2\x80\x99s listen.\n\n\n\n\n Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s Dana. I found a way out of here. I walked the perimeter of the Dog Park looking for a crack or a hole or a weak spot in the obsidian walls. I never found an opening, but\xe2\x80\xa6this is very strange. The walls just keep going!\xc2\xa0If you stand still, the Dog Park seems to take up a single city block, but\xe2\x80\xa6I walked one direction for about two weeks, and I could no longer see the monolith where I started. Or the people I was with. Or even hear the tinfoil rustling of the leaves from the tall, black metal trees that protect us from clouds.\n\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s something else. I found a door. An old oak door, standing unsupported by any other structure. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was an exit from the Dog Park or an entrance to something much worse, but\xe2\x80\xa6I went through it. Now I am in some old house.\n\n\n Cecil, I can hear someone moving around upstairs. I need to go. I will try to call you soon. Thank you for everything, and I hope our time and place match again soon.\n\n\n\n\n Oh, listeners! I so wish I could have talked to Dana this morning! They were showing Cat Ballou again on TBS and I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t break away. I tried to call Dana back, but my phone caught briefly on fire, and something sharp cut open my thumb as I selected her number.\n\n\n And now a Public Service Announcement from the Night Vale SPCA.\n\n\n Thinking about getting a dog? Dogs are not only great family companions, but also help childhood development. By regularly feeding, walking, fighting, denying the existence of, and ultimately soul-merging with the family dog, young children learn about responsibility, empathy, and pyrokinesis.\n\n\n There are, of course, some breeds of dogs that are not right for children. Those breeds include spider wolves, double wolves, switch-bladed mountain dogs, secret terriers, flesh-eating spaniels, pit vipers, and table saws. Visit the SPCA for more information on the right dog for your family.\n\n\n Hello? Dana?\n\n\n\n\n Cecil? I can barely understand you. Cecil, are you there?\n\n\n\n\n Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m here! Dana, are you still in the old house?\n\n\n\n\n No, I\xe2\x80\x99m still in the old house. I made my way out of the basement, which was empty except for a single photograph of a lighthouse. It\xe2\x80\x99s a framed 5x7 black and white photo of this old lighthouse. It hangs crooked just to the right of center on one wall. The lighthouse in the photo looks to be in the middle of a field. There\xe2\x80\x99s no water. Why would there be a lighthouse not near the water?\n\n\n\n\n I have no idea!\n\n\n\n\n No, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s some other reason.\n\n\n Anyway, once I heard the footsteps above me stop, I opened the door to the first floor. I saw a man standing in the middle of the living room, staring straight ahead at the wall. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see his face, Cecil, and I knew that I had been through this moment before\xe2\x80\xa6not like deja vu, more like a clear but fleeting memory of a dream. I was scared he might hear me, Cecil.\n\n\n\n\n What did you do, Dana?\n\n\n\n\n Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I did! I got up the nerve and I spoke to him. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHello sir, my name is Dana and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to intrude, but I was wondering\xe2\x80\xa6is this your home?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t move. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a sound. He just kept staring at another small photo on the wall. I walked closer to him and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, sir. Excuse me, but\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9d And then I saw. Cecil, I saw who it was!\n\n\n\n\n Who was it?\n\n\n\n\n No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her. It was John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? And he was staring at this photo, and I walked closer and said, \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, it\xe2\x80\x99s me, Dana!\xe2\x80\x9d But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond.\n\n\n I looked at the photo he was examining and it was just a picture of a window \xe2\x80\x93 a worn driftwood frame inside of which was a photograph of a worn driftwood pane with gently warped glass. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what was beyond the window in the photo, but there was a shape. Maybe a tree? Maybe a person? John just stared ahead looking sad.\n\n\n No, not sad. Concerned. He looked concerned.\n\n\n I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say another word to him. I waved my hand gently in front of his eyes, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice me. I tried to touch his shoulder, but my hand went right through him! Like through a cold wind! He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even there, Cecil!\n\n\n He eventually turned and looked at another photo on another wall of another window, but he never saw or heard me.\n\n\n This home has no furniture, no furnishings, no belongings \xe2\x80\x93 only photos. Single, small photos on occasional walls. Most of them are windows \xe2\x80\x93 different windows with different panes in different photo frames.\n\n\n The house itself, I realize, has no windows of its own, so\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know if there is a basement or a first or second floor. The upstairs is the downstairs is the ground floor. But I know one thing, Cecil.\n\n\n\n\n What is that?\n\n\n\n\n No, but you\xe2\x80\x99re close.\n\n\n I know that John Peters entered through a door in the kitchen. I can see the door right now, Cecil. It is open, and beyond that door is sunlight. I can see sunlight and sand. I\xe2\x80\x99m going through.\n\n\n\n\n Yes! Dana, do that! Go through the door now! Go through that door!\n\n\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Cecil, you make a good point, but I have to go through that door, no matter what! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get back home!\n\n\n\n\n Do it, Dana. Yes!\n\n\n\n\n Here I go!\n\n\n\n\n Dana? Hello? Dana, can you hear me?\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, I do not know where Dana has gone now. I do hope that we hear from her again. I would try to call her back, but my phone has grown\xe2\x80\xa6spiny legs and is crawling away now.\n\n\n If you are the type to pray, please pray for Dana\xe2\x80\x99s safe return home to Night Vale. If you are not the type to pray, please know that you are violating several laws, and you will receive a knock on your door from armed agents very soon.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at sports.\n\n\n This weekend, the Night Vale High School Scorpions kick off their season against the Pine Cliff High School Lizard Monitors. Scorpions quarterback senior Michael Sandero had off-season surgery to remove the second head he grew in the middle of last season\xe2\x80\x99s division title run. Michael\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Flora Sandero, said she had her son\xe2\x80\x99s original head removed instead, as she liked the new head much better.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis new head\xe2\x80\x99s much handsomer and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk back as much,\xe2\x80\x9d Flora explained from the roof of the Pinkberry, where she was installing several long pikes with dead vultures and rodents on the ends. \xe2\x80\x9cThis new head only speaks Russian, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to listen to him on the phone with his girlfriend all night long, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hog the television because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand any of the English or Spanish programs here. He\xe2\x80\x99s a better boy now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, jamming another pike into the roof of the trendy fro-yo store, before yelling skyward, causing the sparse clouds to part quickly, revealing a giant floating crystal glowing faintly red in the mid-afternoon sun.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s wants to remind you that the most important meal of the day is breakfast. So why would you let a morning go by without staring deeply into the mirror until you no longer recognize the face staring back at you \xe2\x80\x93 mimicking your every gesture, mocking your every movement?\n\n\n How else will you get the energy you need for a full day\xe2\x80\x99s work or recreation if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t silently screaming into the visage of a man or woman who gives you such uneasy spirit, such unshakable terror, a queasy feeling every time you make the connection between what that thing is and what you are becoming?\n\n\n What you have become?\n\n\n Where does the void end? Where do you end? When do you end? What time is it now? You are late for work! You are lying on your bathroom floor, half-dressed in a cool sludge of toothpaste and hair gel. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been crying, but for how long?\n\n\n McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99m lovin\xe2\x80\x99!\n\n\n Listeners, I just received word from Carlos \xe2\x80\x93 lovely Carlos, with his perfect teeth and hair and\xe2\x80\xa6penchant for sometimes chewing a little more loudly than is preferred \xe2\x80\x93 Carlos, who is with other scientists at the Desert Creek Housing Development. For the past year, Carlos has been studying a house that does not exist. It seems like it exists, like it\xe2\x80\x99s just right there when you look at it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s between two identical houses, so it would make more sense for it to be there than not\xe2\x80\xa6but it does not exist.\n\n\n Carlos said the scientists asked him to come over and ring the doorbell, just to see what would happen. They offered him five dollars but he turned it down, saying something about scientific integrity and blah blah blah. But I\xe2\x80\x99m like, five dollars is a taco lunch at Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s Tacos, so, whatever, rich guy!\n\n\n Carlos said that before he could take a step to the house, a woman emerged from the side door talking on her cell phone. He and the scientists ran up to the woman, calling out to her as she walked, quickly, away from the house. She looked panicked.\n\n\n No, not panicked. Concerned. She looked concerned, Carlos said.\n\n\n She kept talking on her cell phone, never responding to them. Carlos said she kept walking until she walked right through them, right through the scientists, like she were a cold wind. And then, she stopped talking into her phone, stared back toward the house, and with a look of panic \xe2\x80\x93 no, with a look of concern \xe2\x80\x93 ran away.\n\n\n Carlos said \xe2\x80\x93 and this is very strange \xe2\x80\x93 Carlos said, \xe2\x80\x9cit sounded like the person she was talking to was you, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Listeners, I do not know where or when Dana is, but I am going to sit by this phone and wait for her call. I know she is all right. I hope she is all right. I fear she is not all right.\n\n\n With great anxiousness \xe2\x80\x93 no, concern. With great concern, I take you now to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lethal Temptress\xe2\x80\x9d by The Mendoza Line]\n\n\n First saved message:\n\n\n\n\n Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I lost your call. I made it out of the door, out of the empty house and its empty photographs into an empty desert, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anything has improved. I can see nothing but endless sand and a single distant mountain \xe2\x80\x93 a mountain I have never seen, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in mountains. But there is a mountain, and there is a tiny red light up on the mountain, intermittently blinking.\n\n\n As I exited the house, the door shut behind me and now it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. As I walked, I moved through something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. I heard voices through digital static, and felt a cold wind across my body. The others are here, but not here, Cecil.\n\n\n What, or who, did I just walk through?\n\n\n Cecil, something is coming. You can feel it in the ground, something very large is coming. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta go. I will call when I can, and tell my mother and brother I am out of the Dog Park and I am safe. For now.\n\n\n Thank you, Cecil.\n\n\n\n\n End of message.\n\n\n Oh, listeners, I wish I had more news than this. I wish my phone would have rung, I wish I could have had that conversation instead of another voice mail. I wish Dana were home, safe. I wish I could feel something other than overwhelming concern.\n\n\n No, not concern \xe2\x80\x93 uncertainty.\n\n\n I wish a lot of things.\n\n\n But, as the old saying goes, if wishes were horses, those wishes would all run away shrieking and bucking, terrified of a great unseen evil.\n\n\n So instead, what I want to say is, I am thankful Dana is out of the Dog Park. I am thankful I had my first conversation with her since Poetry Week. I am thankful Carlos did not ring that doorbell. I am thankful that people listen to this show and the stories about our wonderful little community \xe2\x80\x93 the most scientifically interesting community in America, as my Carlos once said.\n\n\n And, of course, I am thankful for you, Night Vale.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for loud shortwave radio squelches, followed by a lifetime of tinnitus.\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb:\xc2\xa0Look to the sky. You will not find answers there, but you will certainly see what everyone is screaming about.'
