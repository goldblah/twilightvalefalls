Episode 52 - The Retirement of Pamela Winchell
b'Now is your chance.\n\n\n Well, that was it. It\xe2\x80\x99s over. Did you do it? Have you achieved what you wanted?\n\n\n No? Aah, well.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Former mayor Pamela Winchell called an emergency press conference today to announce that she is enjoying her retirement immensely, and she could not be happier to no longer be mayor.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMore happiness is not possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cHappiness is a fool\xe2\x80\x99s daydream.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She was then reminded by reporters that she is no longer mayor, and so shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be calling emergency press conference s, especially when there is none of the usual emergencies happening \xe2\x80\x93 like seeing an interesting butterfly, eating a very good sandwich, or being disappointed that it is 2:00 already.\n\n\n I sought a statement from current mayor Dana Cardinal who is, of course, a former intern and dear friend of mine. I found her at the end of a dark hallway, draped with rotting black cloth and thick with cobwebs, where she was sitting on the Mayoral Throne and contemplating her hands.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be different than this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I asked her specifically her thoughts on former mayor Pamela Winchell continuing to call emergency press conferences.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Dana said. And then, again, \xe2\x80\x9cOooh.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, \xe2\x80\x9cShe can do that if she wants. I\xe2\x80\x99m too busy these days to do press conferences anyway. Tell you what:\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And then, she did tell me what, which is that she is naming Pamela Winchell the Official Night Vale Director of Emergency Press Conferences.\n\n\n When informed of this news, Pamela made a swiping, dismissive gesture with her hands, saying \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t need her permission. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call them if I want. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m retired.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She was crying. She smiled, and she cried.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m retired,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very nice of her. What a wonderful woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call an emergency press conference to let people know what a wonderful woman the new mayor is,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsors:\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is the concept of itching.\n\n\n Listeners, are you looking for an action that will pass the time, but also is mildly irritating? Searching for a way to have your body express reaction to material it is allergic to? Want to express confusion in the most stereotypical manner possible? I am just thrilled to be here on behalf of itching.\n\n\n Itching has been with humans as long as there has been humans. Longer than that, even! Why, beings have been having to scratch themselves almost as long as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been being.\n\n\n It can be fun! It mostly won\xe2\x80\x99t be. But, if it\xe2\x80\x99s your thing, or if it\xe2\x80\x99s in a spot that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to reach, then it can sort of be fun! I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it will definitely be fun, it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be.\n\n\n The concept of itching. For a free sample, just think about it. Oh? There you go! See? Your experiencing it right now!\n\n\n This has been a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n Pamela Winchell called an emergency press conference to announce that, while she thanks the current mayor for her generous offer, after some thought and discussion with a couple of helpful advisers, she simply is too busy being retired to accept.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just too busy fishing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, wildly waving a fishing rod around, slapping it on her podium, and narrowly avoiding catching several reporters with the absurdly oversized hook, as they ducked and scrambled out of reach. \xe2\x80\x9cSee?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fishing right now! This is what fishing looks like, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, cracking the thick, leather fishing line like in that popular and heartwarming series of adventure movies about a wisecracking archaeologist who comically destroys countless important artifacts under the hilarious misapprehension that they belong in his museum rather than in the religious sites of the cultures that made them.\n\n\n As the reporters ran from her dangerous, flailing fishing line, she shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cThis concludes my emergency press conference about my complete retirement from emergency press conferences. Please assemble again in three hours for an emergency press conference that will update you on my retirement status.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She then took hold of a rope, dangling from the hastily-painted blue backdrop that we all assume is the sky, and was lifted up through a door, shaking the flimsy particle board known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe sky\xe2\x80\x9d as she went.\n\n\n In other news, StrexCorp Synernists, Inc., a company which, until recently, had something of an outsized effect on our town, is now under the control of beings who call themselves angels\xe2\x80\xa6and who do not, legally, exist. The existence of the company itself is therefore something of a moral/ethical question, the kind that philosophers consider in their secret black market philosophy meetings.\n\n\n Despite all the difficulties in discussing its very concept, Strex and its new owners have gone about making what they say are constructive repairs to a town damaged by its recent battle with a force that seemed \xe2\x80\x93 but was not \xe2\x80\x93 greater than our own.\n\n\n For instance, they gave Teddy Williams, of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex, the funds to hire contractors to renovate his building, and cover over Lane 5 with asphalt, thus trapping the tiny civilization beneath it that is still declaring war on us.\n\n\n A so-called angel said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cI have donated a coffee table made of human bones to charity, and will use the money I save on taxes to invest in the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex because angels, if we were real, would certainly love to bowl. Or whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d the creature added.\n\n\n Meanwhile, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting regular calls and snapchats from Carlos \xe2\x80\x93 you know, my hero scientist boyfriend \xe2\x80\x93 from the desert otherworld he is very temporarily trapped in. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be back super soon. He says that he found a cactus, only it\xe2\x80\x99s not a cactus, only it is. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain, and that he really wants to explain it. That is what he is for, he said, to explain a world that defies explanation.\n\n\n He sent me a photo of the cactus, but it only appeared on my phone as an error box that said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven if you could, you would wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Well, it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s having fun out there! That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\n\n\n Pamela Winchell called another emergency press conference to show just how well she\xe2\x80\x99s doing without the need to call emergency press conferences.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRetirement is great!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken up bird watching.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She then showed off this new hobby\xe2\x80\xa6in the process, demonstrating a deep misunderstanding of both the concept of birds, and the concept of watching. The resulting fire wiped out the podium and, indeed, the entire Press Conference Gazebo, sending both Pamela and the attending reporters fleeing in every direction.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSee how wonderful being retired is?\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted behind her as she sprinted away, smoke-fueled tears streaming from her sunken eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI love being retired! It\xe2\x80\x99s the best!\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, as the fire spread to several nearby structures despite the earnest lectures and head-shaking from Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s brigade of brave Fire Disapprovers.\n\n\n Ohhh! Listeners! I finally got a chance to eat at Tourniquet, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s hottest new culinary night spot. I mean, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to eat their food, or sit at any of their tables\xe2\x80\xa6reservations are still just too hard to get. But I did make a PB&amp;J at home, and eat it quickly in their front waiting area, as the ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99 glared at me implacably \xe2\x80\x93 as he does to everyone, due to the fact that he is a large idol carved from volcanic rock.\n\n\n But, despite the less-than-ideal visit to the restaurant, it did give me a chance to say hello again to Earl Harland. Now, it was a big surprise for me. My childhood best friend, Earl Harland, working at this restaurant, after being dragged away by mute inter-dimensional children, not to be heard from again for a year and a half. It was a big surprise for me, obviously, because I had no idea he had any interest in cooking, let alone the skills to be a sous chef.\n\n\n Well, I invited him to come on the show sometime, and give all of us a few cooking tips. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll take me up on it, but we might be lucky enough to get a peek into the mystical nearly-forgotten art that is cooking. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that be dangerous! And probably illegal.\n\n\n Despite pleas from local, regional, national, international, and interstellar authorities, Pamela Winchell has continued to give emergency press conferences to publicize her deep enjoyment of retirement. And to decline the new mayor\xe2\x80\x99s standing job offer to give emergency press conferences.\n\n\n Her press conference about tropical fish care resulted in a deadly flash flood that swept through old town Night Vale, washing away everyone\xe2\x80\x99s piles of cool stones they had found.\n\n\n Her demonstration of coin collecting crashed several world economies\xe2\x80\xa6in the process, breaking a ten year peace treaty that had ended the previous Blood Space War.\n\n\n And her demonstration of mass poisoning, unfortunately, went without a hitch.\n\n\n Even as her press conferences have become much more fatal than usual, she has increased their frequency considerably, sometimes having two press conferences so close together that they actually occur simultaneously, Pamela speaking in a rapid back and forth to two different groups of reporters, as she shows two different cataclysmic methods of retirement she has recently been taught by her mysterious team of advisers.\n\n\n More on this story as Pamela continues to create it.\n\n\n And now, some life hacks that will allow you to parse and reprogram the code of life \xe2\x80\x93 thus changing the very fabric of your being in a clumsy and likely horrifying fashion. Also, a handy way of organizing your entire existence through a complex system of binder clips and toilet paper rolls. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started!\n\n\n Life hack one is\xe2\x80\xa6oh! Umm, listeners, Intern Maureen is waving to me frantically from the control room \xe2\x80\x93 well, more frantically than she does at all times about the general terrifying nature of life \xe2\x80\x93 and she\xe2\x80\x99s mouthing something\xe2\x80\xa6flannel fisher? Animals whiz beer? Oh! Oh! No. She\xe2\x80\x99s mouthing \xe2\x80\x9cPamela is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Listeners, it seems that Pamela Winchell, her Press Conference Gazebo burned down, has chosen the steps of the community radio station as the site of her next retirement demonstration. Given the affect of her previous demonstrations, this could spell doom for our little station and our little lives. I must\xe2\x80\xa6I must try to talk to her. I will, listeners, I will make her listen.\n\n\n And while I make her listen, I will also make you listen to the weather.\n\n\n Now, Pamela? Pamela! Stop!\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cHere I Land\xe2\x80\x9d by Nicholas Stevenson]\n\n\n Well, we have returned, as we always do! All of us. Unless we don\xe2\x80\x99t, as we sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t. All of us.\n\n\n Many people who have had Night Vale Community Radio mean something in their lives rushed to the front steps of the building to save this vital part of our little town. The crowd held most of the population of our beloved burg. In this modern age of media there is, of course, no medium so close to the common heart as community radio.\n\n\n Leading the crowd was Mayor Dana, who pressed Ms. Winchell further to accept her offer of the official position. But Pamela was unswayed. She, in fact, was standing rigidly, her eyes rolled to the whites, her fingers splayed, booming \xe2\x80\x9cRETIREMENT! RETIREMENT!\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice that was not her own.\n\n\n A great wind gusted up from around her body, whirling through the crowd and sweeping Intern Maureen away into the distance.\n\n\n To the family and friends of Intern Maureen, et cetera.\n\n\n Anyway.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cPamela!\xe2\x80\x9d we cried, unified under threat, just as we are often at odds through peace, \xe2\x80\x9cPamela! Do not retire! We need you!\xe2\x80\x9d we cried. \xe2\x80\x9cSpecifically, we need you to stop demonstrating your retirement! Stop doing that right away!\xe2\x80\x9d we said in unison and in fear.\n\n\n But Pamela would not hear us. We had given up all hope, and were casting about for other things to give up:dreams, aspirations, and then, digging further, anticipated muscle pains \xe2\x80\x93 pre-grief for loss that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, post-grief for losses long ago \xe2\x80\x93 and further still, until we were ready to give up that shifting, shivery spark that is our human heart itself.\n\n\n But then\xe2\x80\xa6but then\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what happened next. There seems to be just a gap in my memory, much longer and deeper than the usual gaps that we all develop in our memories to protect us from forbidden information we might have heard, or Hooded Figures we might have accidentally brushed against in the dark of our rooms just before we turn on the lights.\n\n\n But fortunately, being a reporter, I had my Little Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Book of Big-Boy Note Taking, just like I\xe2\x80\x99ve had since I was five years old, and the prophecies were first revealed that I was destined to be the voice of our little community. I always make notes in this book, even if I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it. See? Just now I wrote down, \xe2\x80\x9cSaid: always makes notes in this book, even if I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Wow! Very accurate, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not even holding a pen!\n\n\n Anyway, I can just consult my notes and see how this situation was solved. Umm, OK. It appears here that a Man in a Tan Jacket holding a deerskin suitcase approached Pamela\xe2\x80\x99s podium.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFear not!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, perhaps a tad melodramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI can relate to what she\xe2\x80\x99s going through,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can talk her through this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou look very familiar,\xe2\x80\x9d we all shouted back, still in unison. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met you before. Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But the Man in the Tan Jacket was already skittering, spider-like, up to Pamela, and whispering into her ear. No one could hear what he said, according to my notes, but Pamela seemed to immediately respond to his voice, stopping the mass destruction of her retirement activities and listening intently, occasionally nodding and saying \xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh. Uh-huh. Ah-hah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And then, miracle of miracles, she stepped away from the podium.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMayor Cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would be happy to accept the role of Director of Emergency Press Conferences. Thank you, and I am no longer retired.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She then asked everyone to meet her tomorrow at 7:00am sharp in the newly-rebuilt Press Conference Gazebo, for her first official emergency press conference in that role.\n\n\n As for the mysterious man, he of the tan jacket and deerskin suitcase, he turned to the audience, and started a lecture about the place he is from, frequently naming it, and even pointing to it on a map. But any time the name of the place should appear in my notes, the writing has been violently scratched out to the point of tearing through the paper. And then, just blank pages, until a few minutes ago when my notes resume.\n\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened. Or, at least, according to my notes. It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that during that memory gap, I decided to use my notebook to try out a first foray into realistic fiction, and that something else entirely happened. Who knows which fictional version of the fictional past is true?\n\n\n And so, listeners, now that we are safe, let us take a moment of deep sympathy for Pamela Winchell. One of the great fears among a life of great fears, perhaps the last great fear is the fear of being no longer useful. We find a role in life, and we do that role to the best of our ability for as long as that ability is there. But all of us \xe2\x80\x93 even me, dear listeners \xe2\x80\x93 will someday hit a point where we no longer are able to do that thing that we define ourselves by doing. And more than the fear of injury, more than the fear of death, this is the fear that looms. The loss of self. The self that is self we imagined we were our whole lives. But we were never that self, not really. We were only a series of selves, living one role and then leaving it for another. And all the time convincing ourselves that there was no change. That we were always the same person, living the same life. One arc to a finish, not the stutter-stop improvisation that is our actual lives.\n\n\n Worry less about the person you once were. Or the person you dream you someday will be. Worry about the person you are now. Or don\xe2\x80\x99t even worry! Just be that person. Be the best version of that person you can be. Be a better version than any of the other versions in any of the many parallel universes. Check regularly online to see the rankings.\n\n\n Pamela Winchell was mayor. And now, she is not. But that does not mean she is not anything. She is still Pamela. She is still a human being. And now, she is also the Director of Emergency Press Conferences. We look forward to the Pamela that is, and whatever Pamela will come after.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for a world so possible that its very possibility feels constricting.\n\n\n And of course, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Most people think pit bulls are dangerous dogs, but \xe2\x80\x93 biologically speaking \xe2\x80\x93 most pit bulls are just three shih tzus wearing a trenchcoat.'
