Episode 36 - Missing
b"Red sky at night. Sailor\xe2\x80\x99s delight. Red sky at night, the sailors are howling and laughing. The sailors begin to surround us, and the night sky is so\xc2\xa0very\xc2\xa0red.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Listeners, I hate to start our program off with sad news, but our new station owner \xe2\x80\x93 StrexCorp \xe2\x80\x93 handed me a Missing Child Alert right as I walked into the studio.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cStrexCorp is asking Night Vale citizens to be on the lookout for Tamika Flynn, age 13. She is described as 5'1\xe2\x80\x9d, stocky build, black hair and dark eyes. Dark.\xc2\xa0So dark.\xc2\xa0So wise beyond time. So deep in their understanding that to gaze into them is to gaze into your own death. It is not important where she was last seen or by whom. Why do you need to know that? Why are you asking so many questions? You are taking valuable time away from important and highly-fulfilling work at your place of employment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Missing Child Report reads.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cStexCorp asks that anyone with\xc2\xa0any\xc2\xa0knowledge about Tamika Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts should contact StrexCorp Headquarters by picking up a phone, and talking. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re not hard to find.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I asked my new supervisor, Daniel, why it\xe2\x80\x99s StrexCorp that is issuing a Missing Child Alert, and not Tamika Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s family or the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police. But he just started shaking, and sparking, and humming. Then the hallway got too cloudy and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe, and my show was starting, so I left him alone.\n\n\n He\xe2\x80\x99s still standing at the studio window, staring at me, twitching, sparks subsiding, but his mouth has fallen open revealing\xe2\x80\xa6is that motor oil? Tar? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to concentrate if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s go now to the Community Calendar.\n\n\n Tuesday, there\xe2\x80\x99s a false start. A mistaken understanding of time. Tuesday, we will wake, and walk to our normal places \xe2\x80\x93 our showers, kitchens, cars, desks \xe2\x80\x93 only to find the day never began. We will slowly notice an absence of all matter, all light, all time.\n\n\n And then, as suddenly as we false-started, we will begin our actual day. And everything will happen the same. Only, because of our awareness of it all, it will happen differently. Less differently at first, but more differently later.\n\n\n Wednesday will take forever. For-eeeeeeevvvvvveeeerrrrr. Not literally, but very near literally. Ugh! Wednesday hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten here, and I already want it over with!\n\n\n Thursday, a faint outline of a dull face will appear in the dark as you try to sleep. You will notice its blank stare; its straight, expressionless lips; its thick brow; and the subtle hint of slow collected breaths. It will seem to be watching you,\xc2\xa0curious\xc2\xa0about you, as if it were not from here. It\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0not from here. You will lock eyes. You will barely be able to make out the face\xe2\x80\x99s humanoid features but you will know, deep down, it is not human. Not human\xc2\xa0at all.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it want?\xe2\x80\x9d you will think. Probably nothing. Let it go. Get some sleep.\n\n\n Friday is an open house at the Night Vale Community College. Thinking of furthering your education? Considering taking winter semester classes? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a trap! Do not go near the Night Vale Community College this Friday. Ha! Nice try, giant worms, but we know your tricks! Faking a Community College open house is\xc2\xa0very obvious, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? I mean, it was a nice touch, creating a fake press release to get into various news outlets like ours, but we see through you!\n\n\n No, we really do. Your skin is translucent, and it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of gross. No offense.\n\n\n Saturday, everyone is their own person. You are free to disregard others and recognize yourself as\xc2\xa0one, for once. Pour some wine, draw a bath, light some incense, and grab a city-approved novel. It\xe2\x80\x99s your time.\n\n\n Sunday will be full of regret. Also, joy. Also, laughter. Also, conversation. Also, long stretches of unmemorable moments. It will mostly be that last thing. In your old age, as you look back on your life, if someone were to ask what happened on that Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 you remember, that\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0Sunday, with the regret, and joy, and laughter, and conversation \xe2\x80\x93 if someone were to ask you that, you would be hard-pressed to come up with a single memorable moment from this coming Sunday.\n\n\n This has been the Community Calendar.\n\n\n An update on our missing child report: We just received world that 13 year-old Tamika Flynn is\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0missing. This word came from Tamika herself.\n\n\n Witnesses said they saw Tamika standing atop the pedestal of one of this town\xe2\x80\x99s most historical works of art: the 138 year-old bronze statue of actor Lee Marvin, just outside the Night Vale Post Office. Tamika told a gathered crowd that she was not missing, she has never\xc2\xa0been\xc2\xa0missing. She clarified that she has always been where she has been, she has always been from where she is from, and she will always be going where she is going.\n\n\n Witnesses reported that Tamika had a canvas tote bag full of heavy stones over her left shoulder, a worn-out copy of Willa Cather\xe2\x80\x99s Death Comes for the Archbishop in her right rear pants pocket, and that she was still holding the severed head of the Librarian she defeated so valiantly in August, saving our town and all of the participants of the Library\xe2\x80\x99s treacherous Summer Reading Program.\n\n\n As yellow helicopters began to approach her, Tamika shouted to the gathered crowd to stop looking for her.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI am found! I am found! I am found!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated dramatically, rhythmically, the crowd swaying and moved by her homiletic passion. \xe2\x80\x9cStop looking for me, and find\xc2\xa0yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d she was last heard crying over the crescendo of helicopters landing.\n\n\n The remaining crowd, still singing her phrases, still undiluted, inadvertently blocked the StrexCorp agents from reaching Tamika before she disappeared in plain sight.\n\n\n StrexCorp has issued, just moments ago, several\xc2\xa0dozen\xc2\xa0more Missing Child Reports. They say children keep going missing. And they bet that if you find one specific child, one specific, very determined, and difficult child (and they mean that in the best possible way), if you find that one child, you will probably find\xc2\xa0all\xc2\xa0of the missing children.\n\n\n StrexCorp is asking that if anyone has seen Tamika Flynn, to contact them immediately.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a missing child. And shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you care about that? Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you care about the children?\xe2\x80\x9d StrexCorp asked. \xe2\x80\x9cChildren are the future,\xe2\x80\x9d they added. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you felt the same way and would help us find this\xe2\x80\xa6this\xe2\x80\xa6child,\xe2\x80\x9d they stammered, looking slightly agitated.\n\n\n More on this, soon.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look now at traffic.\n\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s a man. Imagine him. He\xe2\x80\x99s leaning on a fence, shirtless and weary. He seems wise near the eyes, but his impatient feet suggest insidiousness. He\xe2\x80\x99s marked with dried mud, and maybe some very deep but quickly-healing cuts \xe2\x80\x93 from the tree branches, most likely, or perhaps the birds.\n\n\n OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m not telling you the whole truth. It was definitely the birds.\n\n\n Imagine these cuts and scratches, dry and brittle now, but tender to the touch. He is certain he did not offend the birds, but he is uncertain whether his complacency was construed as equal to said offense.\n\n\n Picture this. Picture the man leaning on the criss-crossing metal wires, waiting. The birds are gone, but other things are coming. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically what, but he knows it\xe2\x80\x99ll come for\xc2\xa0him.\n\n\n You know this, too, because I have told you.\n\n\n The man says nothing.\n\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s never not something that has been displaced, marginalized. There\xe2\x80\x99s never not something that, when feeling pressed to the wall, to a place with no room left to run, gathers its numbers, gathers its forces, and turns, savagely, on its oppressor. Turns viciously, and without inhibition, even on those who merely\xc2\xa0look\xc2\xa0like its oppressor.\n\n\n Do you catch my meaning? Can you imagine the scene I am explaining?\n\n\n How much of the world makes sense\xc2\xa0to you?\n\n\n What does it mean to be a hero? To be a\xc2\xa0human?\n\n\n The man thinks about his heart. It beats. It beats normally. Earlier, it did not beat normally.\n\n\n Think about your own heart. Is it beating normally?\n\n\n Listen. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a long moment.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n How is your heart?\n\n\n Do you remember the man? The one on the fence, shirtless and scarred, with the normally-beating heart? He\xe2\x80\x99s not real. Take him out of the story, but leave the story. Take him out, leave the story.\n\n\n Do you catch my meaning?\n\n\n Do you?\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n Deep, deep, deep in the grass, grass, grass, what grows, grows, grows? Who knows, knows, knows?\n\n\n Strex. Strrrrrexxx! Strrrrrrrrrrrrrrexxxxxx!\n\n\n StrexCorp Synernists, Inc. Working hard so you can work harder. Work harder. Seriously. Work. Harder. StrexCorp. Get to work!\n\n\n More now on the missing children story.\n\n\n Several helmeted and sunglassed helicopter pilots have stepped forward to announce that they had nothing to do with the missing children.\n\n\n Sheila Nowitzky, a pilot for one of the many black helicopters that are routinely circling Night Vale, said she\xe2\x80\x99s a harmless spy from the World Government, and would never harm an American child without a direct order.\n\n\n Marco Padilla, a pilot for one of the many blue Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police copters, said nothing \xe2\x80\x93 but you could see in his face he meant no harm to our kids.\n\n\n And a shadowy haze that claimed, through telepathy, to be the pilot of one of the mysterious helicopters with elaborate murals depicting birds of prey diving, admitted that, while their helicopters were the ones that took away all the children in Night Vale several weeks ago, they brought them back. \xe2\x80\x9cThey brought them back, OK? And they\xe2\x80\x99re fine. Get off of me!\xe2\x80\x9d the humid gray haze emphasized. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, you take a bunch of kids one time.\xc2\xa0One time!\xc2\xa0Geez!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Listeners, Today I want to talk to you about the dangers of deer.\n\n\n Are they beautiful? Yes. Are they graceful and picturesque, even borderline majestic beasts? Yes, yes, and yes. And, are they helpful to the community because real estate agents live inside of them? Of course!\n\n\n But deer are also dangerous creatures. They are terrible, deceitful, and vile animals. I\xe2\x80\x99m not being mean, this is just\xc2\xa0basic science.\n\n\n Look, I know deer are cute and friendly-looking. We all remember adorable little Bambi, from the classic animated movie, with his sweet voice and white freckled rump. But we also remember the bloody end that he wrought on the humans at the end of the film, the graphic beheadings, and trees streaked with gore during the famous revenge-fueled climax.\n\n\n The lesson of that movie, as in life itself, is that nature is gorgeous, and it is horrible, and it\xc2\xa0will\xc2\xa0kill you.\n\n\n This has been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n\n This just in:\n\n\n Oh my, uh, some disastrous news! Quite terrible! There has been a helicopter crash out by the old Car Lot. Witnesses report hearing youthful shouts and screams, followed by loud metallic clanging. They saw smoke trailing across the cold, dark afternoon sky (because, of course, the sun again did not rise today). They saw a yellow mangle of metal, and rotors, and\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Um, listeners? Daniel is still standing at my studio door. He has stopped staring. He is now yelling, but\xe2\x80\xa6without noise. He looks very upset. I can read his lips. He is saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTurn it off. Shut it down. No more news today. We are shutting you down?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n They\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn off my microphone, Night Vale!\n\n\n Um, I\xe2\x80\x99ve locked the door, which will buy me some time while Daniel goes to find a security guard with keys. So let me take you now, for as long as it can last, to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPeanuts\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0Sam \xe2\x80\x98n Ash]\n\n\n Listeners? I do not know if you can hear me. I am only trusting that I did this right.\n\n\n I wired my phone into the soundboard, and then wired the soundboard into the radio tower, which is running on auxiliary power. It\xe2\x80\x99s, um, a cool trick my childhood best friend Earl Harlan taught me back when we were in Boy Scouts together, earning our Subversive Radio Host badge.\n\n\n I doubt Daniel, or any of the new station management, can hear me as they do not like listening to radio shows. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m hiding up on the roof with my makeshift studio.\n\n\n During the weather, I got word from some witnesses at the helicopter accident. The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police found several large slingshots and heavy stones nearby that matched, in size and shape, the dents on the helicopter\xe2\x80\x99s engine casing.\n\n\n They also found a well-worn and heavily-notated copy of Death Comes for the Archbishop by Willa Cather.\n\n\n Inside the book was a bookmark, marking page 267. On that page was the underlined phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not die of a cold, my son. I shall die of having lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And on the bookmark was a handwritten note. It said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour pilot is fine. She is ours now. She will return when she is ready, but she will return better. T.F.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I do not know if that T.F. Stands for our missing girl \xe2\x80\x93 our brilliant, and bold, and missing girl. If station management\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0listening, I, of course, hope we find Tamika Flynn and bring her home safely.\n\n\n I hope that she will find you first, that is.\n\n\n Remember what I said, listeners, about the traffic? About the birds? Think on that. Think on lots of things. Think about heroes, and whether we should even need them.\n\n\n The answer is, we do not.\n\n\n I sometimes wish I could tell you more, but I cannot. I cannot tell you everything I think you should hear because it is\xe2\x80\xa6boring. Or, it is unnecessary. Or it is\xc2\xa0very\xc2\xa0necessary, but unapproved.\n\n\n There are many reasons I cannot always tell you what I want to tell you, but the main reason is that you need to find it out for yourself. I could preach, and teach, and shout, and explain, but no lesson is as powerful as the lesson learned on one\xe2\x80\x99s own.\n\n\n You can do it! You don\xe2\x80\x99t need old Cecil telling you what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in town. No. I just report the news. I just arrange it.\xc2\xa0You\xc2\xa0figure it out.\xc2\xa0You\xc2\xa0learn from it.\xc2\xa0You\xc2\xa0take action.\xc2\xa0You\xc2\xa0create the meaning. It is all up to\xc2\xa0you.\n\n\n And, given my current broadcasting situation, it may be up to you for a long time.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99d better get downstairs before they discover what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. Stay tuned next for silence, self-reflection, and a long pause to hear yourself think.\n\n\n Use that silence well.\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Look, up in the sky! It\xe2\x80\x99s a bird! It\xe2\x80\x99s a plane! No, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the Void. Infinite and indifferent. We are so small. So very, very small."
