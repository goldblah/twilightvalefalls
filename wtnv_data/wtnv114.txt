Episode 95 - Zookeeper
b'It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a cursed talisman must be in want of a hex reversal.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n Night Vale, we have a special treat for you today. Joanna Rey, head zookeeper at the Night Vale Zoo, joins us live in studio. She\xe2\x80\x99s also brought in several animals for us to see. Since this is radio, if you are not a telepath or an omnipresent spirit, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to see them. You\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to imagine the animals, but that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be difficult. As the old saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand words is worth a picture.\xe2\x80\x9d So today\xe2\x80\x99s show should be worth about 2.6 pictures. You will also be able to envision 2.6 animals during today\xe2\x80\x99s show. \n\n Cecil: Joanna, welcome to our program.\n\n Joanna: Thanks for having me!\n\n Cecil: I can see you brought in some really interesting.. what are those, raccoons? \n\n Joanna: These are chickens.\n\n Cecil: [fascinated] Oooh!\n\n Joanna: One of the evolutionary defensive traits of the chicken is its resemblance to the raccoon. For instance, both animals have two eyes and antennae, and like the raccoon, the chicken is mortal, which is a term zoologists use to describe animals that eventually die.\n\n Cecil: Hmm, I remember as a small child I found a dead raccoon in our yard, and I told my mother about it. I thought it was sleeping. But that day, my mother sat me down and explained death to me. \xe2\x80\x9cCecil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmost of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures are born, and then one day they die. Just like you and me, one day both of us will die. One of us will do so in a much more eventful way than the other, unlike this raccoon, which died from a rock I dropped on it. \n\n Joanna: Why did your mother drop a rock on a raccoon? \n\n Cecil: [amused] Oh, she was always a jokester, always up to some kind of prank. Dropping rocks on people and animals was just her way of kidding around. Anyway, these chickens are gorgeous, with their bright orange and yellow wings and dozens of spiny legs. What\xe2\x80\x99s weird is I always assumed chickens were mythical, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one in person.\n\n Joanna: Mm, a lot of people make that mistake in logic. But just because you cannot see something, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. This is something zoologists must always remember, because there are so many creatures not visible to human sight. Like amoebas and microbes and ghost horses. When visitors come to the Night Vale Zoo, staff members from our audience education team often hide in the shrubbery and then jump out shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m real!\xe2\x80\x9d at the blindfolded zoo goers, just to educate people on the existence of things they can\xe2\x80\x99t see.\n\n Cecil: I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot of neat things while wearing a blindfold! We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to your wonderful creatures in a moment, Joanna, but first today\xe2\x80\x99s news. \n\n [growling]\n\n Cecil: Wait, what was that? \n\n Joanna: Nothing. What? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a low growling sound. [laughs nervously] Is it hot in here? \n\n Cecil: Ookay, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a glance at traffic. The roads are totally clear today, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real mess out there. No one can see where the streets are, because they are completely transparent. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell you which avenues and intersections to avoid, but since they\xe2\x80\x99re virtually invisible, that information is useless. Perhaps try walking or just staying at home.\n\n Joanna: Wow! Glad I flew here today instead of driving, huh? \n\n Cecil: Good call!\n\n An update on Old Woman Josie. Several of you have written in, via email and spray paint on the station walls, that you want to know how she\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s out of the hospital, back home and recovering nicely. Apparently Josie\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Alondra has come back to Night Vale to help care for her. I rarely hear Josie mention her children, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much about Alondra this time either. Apparently Alondra decided to return to her home town to take care of her mother, because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want an old woman with a broken hip trying to live on her own. Josie insisted that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t living alone, that she had several, what she refers to as.. angels, named Erika, who are taking care of her. As well as her StrexCorp foundation, which supports not only the New Old Opera House, but also several local arts groups, a library destruction fund, and the popular charity Cars for Kids, which provides cars to kids who do not have cars. The angels, according to Josie, have lived at her house for several years and have shown nothing but grace, love, and support for her, unlike her family who moved away from the desert. Josie definitely sounds upset, and sometimes the forced bond of family relationships can be frustrating. But having family to take care of you when you live alone is a true blessing. \n\n Um, listeners, Intern Kareem is shaking his head at me and saying Josie lives with the angels. [shouting] Now we went over this in the meeting, Kareem! We do not acknowledge the existence of angels, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, Josie lives alone, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to take care of her! Oh come on, don\xe2\x80\x99t walk out! Ugh. There he goes, a man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in time-traveling trains or deer-faced destroyer gods, but deny a single angel and he\xe2\x80\x99s throwing a fit. Well, best wishes to Old Woman Josie, and welcome back to Night Vale, Alondra.  \n\n Cecil: So let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to your fantastic zoo animals, Joanna. \n\n Joanna: Sure thing! Let me just get this cage up here on the desk.\n\n Cecil: Listeners, Joanna is lifting what looks like a solid steel cube, onto the desk. She\xe2\x80\x99s opening it. Lots of steam or vapor is coming out, I\xe2\x80\x99m so excited. What kind of exotic creature has she brought for us in such a dramatic carrying case? \n\n Joanna: These, Cecil, are brown tarantulas. [chuckles]\n\n Cecil: [disappointed] Oooh.\n\n Joanna: You don\xe2\x80\x99t sound excited. \n\n Cecil: Well, brown tarantulas are fairly common in the desert, I-I was hoping for something exotic like chickens.\n\n Joanna: Of course, but the reason I brought these tarantulas is to talk about our animal development initiative. Zoos not only display animals in tiny enclosures for the public to gawk at, but we also train and rehabilitate many of these animals. Sometimes animals we bring in have been badly injured, or in the case of these tarantulas, horribly undereducated. You might not notice just by looking at them, but our animal development team has taught these tarantulas to read! They are fully sentient. That\xe2\x80\x99s Samantha, that\xe2\x80\x99s Jordy, that\xe2\x80\x99s Nash, that\xe2\x80\x99s Carmelo. That\xe2\x80\x99s Patrice, that\xe2\x80\x99s Garfield, and somewhere.. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see where she went, is Helen. Oh, there she is, on the back of your shirt collar!\n\n Cecil: [nervously] Aahahaahahahaa-hi, Helen! That\xe2\x80\x99s amazing! I know there are several \xe2\x80\x9cteach spiders to read\xe2\x80\x9d programs here in Night Vale. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to hear some of them are really working. So uhh Helen, what book are you reading? \n\n Joanna: Oh, tarantulas can\xe2\x80\x99t speak. Or write. Just read.\n\n Cecil: So they can read, but not express to anyone what it is they have learned?\n\n Joanna: Yup.\n\n Cecil: Is there any consideration by the zoo about developing sentience in creatures who live in cages? I mean, do you think that the animals\xe2\x80\x99 self-awareness could bring about stages of depression or resentment, or despair or even rage, if they understood the prison-like conditions in which they lived? \n\n Joanna: Totally. Oh, also I brought in some baby pigs! \n\n Cecil: [squealing] Oh piglets! Oh they\xe2\x80\x99re so cute! Um, your name is Wobbles, and your name, oh, your name is The Professor!\n\n [loud growling noise]\n\n Cecil: There\xe2\x80\x99s that noise again. \n\n Joanna: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. \n\n Cecil: Did you say..? \n\n Joanna: Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\n\n Cecil: Oh, OK. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to our program sponsor now. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is brought to you by Starbucks. Start your day off feeling great. Maybe grab a latte or a caramel macchiato or even a mocha frappuccino on your way to work. Just make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling great first. We\xe2\x80\x99ll know if you\xe2\x80\x99re not. If you purchase one of our products while not feeling great, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make us not feel great, and that kind of negativity is infectious, you know. Perhaps you think our coffee-related product line will help you get beyond not feeling great into actually feeling great, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on nutritional stimulants to achieve positivity. No, no. Caffeine and sugar will get your energy up, sure, but that crash is coming, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be pretty. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want you hanging that on us. Get yourself in a good place. Really be positive. Fake it till you make it, we suppose. But you better be an excellent faker. If we find out you showed up to one of our thousands of Starbucks locations worldwide while unhappy, we are going to be livid. Just beside ourselves, all of us, every Starbucks employee standing in a line, literally beside ourselves, holding hands and saying directly to you: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come here with your nasty attitude and expect us to bear the weight. Oh no. Oh NO, you will NOT.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Starbucks. Cool your hot mess before you show your face around here. \n\n A few weeks back, we reported several five-headed dragons had arrived in Night Vale. Including Hadassah McDaniels, the sister of current death row inmate, Hiram McDaniels. Most of them are between 10 and 25 feet tall, and all have five heads. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting more and more complaints from local businesses and human Night Vale residents about these dragons. Marjory Valejo, manager of the Dollar Cinema, says each dragon takes up nearly a dozen seats, not to mention obstructing the view of all the seats behind the dragon\xe2\x80\x99s mass of long heads. Teddy Williams, owner of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex, had to cancel league nights this week because he\xe2\x80\x99s having to buff out all of the claw marks in the lanes. It was actually lucky for my team, which is down one member, while Old Woman Josie recovers. Bob Stern, vice president of finance for the Night Vale Auto Insurance company, said his company has seen a significant uptick in dragon-initiated accidents, and that they would no longer cover anyone who owns a car. He then deliberately broke his own arm with a wrench and guffawed nervously.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s been a tough adjustment, Night Vale, to our five-headed guests from another world, but we are a friendly town. Remember to welcome strangers with a friendly point, as you shout \xe2\x80\x9cInterloper!\xe2\x80\x9d at them. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s considered good neighborly behavior to follow strangers home while repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? Where you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d The dragons, I\xe2\x80\x99m.. um, kind of sure.. mean us no harm. \n\n Joanna, have you ever seen a dragon upclose? \n\n Joanna: [gasps] Yes, one. They\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful things, really intelligent and funny creatures. Fiercely loyal. Well, to their own kind, anyway. I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re texting with a dragon, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do on Friday?\xe2\x80\x9d and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t text you back, and you\xe2\x80\x99re like, \xe2\x80\x9cDonna, I would like to see you, it\xe2\x80\x99s been weeks, is everything OK?\xe2\x80\x9d And then one day you get a phonecall and Donna\xe2\x80\x99s gold head is like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a great woman, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a nice time but..\xe2\x80\x9d and her green head is like, [snaps] \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over, Joanna!\xe2\x80\x9d and then you\xe2\x80\x99re just crying and crying for what? [angrily] I mean, come on Donna, really? [sighs sadly]\n\n Cecil: Soo what other animals have you brought in? \n\n Joanna: Well this is a long-horned steer, so majestic and bold. \n\n Cecil: Wow, look at those horns!\n\n Joanna: Also those wings. Wings are the best part of the steer.\n\n Cecil: You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m always in awe of animals who can fly.\n\n Joanna: Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so delicious! \n\n [loud growling]\n\n Cecil: Joanna? \n\n [growling intensifies] \n\n Cecil: Joanna, your face it\xe2\x80\x99s.. widening. Your eyes are turning yellow and and and your paws, I mean, your hands are turning into paws. Listeners, Joanna is now.. uh what.. wh-what are you, a-a panther, I think? Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s jumping onto the, oh oh my ooh, ooh that is, that is not good. \n\n Joanna: [speaking with her mouth full] The wings are the best part in steer, they\xe2\x80\x99re so.. [growling continues]\n\n Cecil: Listeners, Joanna is jumping after the hens now. We need to.. oh my god, the piglets. Wobbles! The Professor! No, I.. [squealing noises] OK, well I wish I had not seen that. While we try to restore order, let me take you to the we- Microphones are not for eating! They are smarter than dolphins! Joanna! \n\n [growling]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cCoffee\xe2\x80\x9d by Sylvan Esso] \n\n Cecil: And we are back. Our special guest today has been Joanna Rey, head zookeeper at the Night Vale Zoo. Thanks for being on our show, Joanna!\n\n Joanna: Thanks for having me. \n\n Cecil: You\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten all of the animals you brought in today.\n\n Joanna: Well, except for the tarantulas. They wandered off. Not sure where they went. Just like a bunch of spiders to be there one second and gone the next. [laughs]\n\n Cecil: Oh, my intern Kareem tells me they all wandered over to the Human Resources department here at the station, and applied for sales jobs. Apparently they were strong interviewers, despite not being able to speak our write.\n\n Joanna: Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big success for our animal development initiative! There is so much good a zoo does for animals, besides lock them up and examine them, which is of course just part of maintaining a natural environment for these creatures. Without the conservation efforts of the zoo, these animals would just be locked up and examined by predators.\n\n Cecil: But in the confines of the zoo, they seem to be at risk of being devoured by zoo staff members who turns into predatory cats.\n\n Joanna: Cecil, that\xe2\x80\x99s my lunch we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\n\n Cecil: So you just got overwhelmed with hunger, and your body turned into a panther and you ate all the animals? \n\n Joanna: [indignantly] I\xe2\x80\x99m a shapeshifter, Cecil! I only take the form of a cat when I eat, because people get all upset when I devour an entire cow looking like a human. I am sorry about the damage to your studio, I really am. I should have eaten before I came. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be so quick to judge shapeshifters, Cecil! We don\xe2\x80\x99t get \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelmed\xe2\x80\x9d. We just choose our appearances based on what we want to express, like clothing. You might wear, say, a T-shirt around the house doing chores or while on vacation, but I imagine you have different outfits to wear to work.\n\n Cecil: Oh yes. Although today is Plastic Poncho Wednesday so I\xe2\x80\x99m dressed up a bit more, but yeah, for work I usually wear a cummerbund and capri pants, because it\xe2\x80\x99s important to me that people understand I am a journalist. I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying Joanna, that\xe2\x80\x99s fair. I bet being able to take the form of different animals in fact makes your job a lot easier at the zoo.\n\n Joanna: Hmm. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only ever used this ability to eat lunch, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea! I should try it at work sometime.\n\n Cecil: Well thanks for being on our show today, Joanna.\n\n Joanna: Sure. You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of chicken blood pooling around your desk. Let me get another paper towel.\n\n Cecil: Oh oh no no, it\xe2\x80\x99s no bother. Intern Kareem, could you, could you come in here? \n\n Stay tuned next, Night Vale, for the sound of scrubbing, followed by the sound of gagging. Followed by the sound of liquid dribbling into a metal pan.\n\n And as always, goodnight, Night Vale, goodnight. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Want to feel old? People born in 2014 have already graduated college, don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a trombone is, and are all named after gourds.\n\n [Loud screaming/cawing/hissing and other interesting sounds, followed by laughter]'
