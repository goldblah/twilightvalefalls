Episode 94 - All Right
b'[Transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s note: This episode\nis designed to be listened to with headphones]\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nall right. All right. Allll right. Allllllll right.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n [From right ear only]\n\n Listeners,\nyour headphones are not malfunctioning. I assume\nyou are wearing headphones, as instructed by that Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nPolice mandate last week. This was for your protection and safety,\nand also to boost headphone sales, now that the city has acquired a\nlocal headphone manufacturer as a municipal asset.\n\n I am\nreporting today only from your right ear. Or, if you have difficulty\nhearing in that ear, simply reverse your headphones so that you can\neasily hear me with one ear. Please remove the headphone from the ear\nthat you are not hearing me from. I need you to be able to hear the\nworld around you. This is vitally important to your continued\nsurvival.\n\n We\nhave been informed that a very dangerous creature has accidentally\nbeen released into Night Vale by the federal government, and it could\nbe any place that this radio signal reaches. It could be near you\nnow, hungry, hunting.\n\n When\nasked for specifics about the creature, representatives from the\ngovernment said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat creature?\xe2\x80\x9d and whistled nonchalantly,\nwhile tossing out leaflets with titles like \xe2\x80\x9cRunning: A Healthy\nHobby, But Futile Against the Beast\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat To Do When You are\nDoomed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Please,\nthroughout today\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast, keep one ear open to what is around\nyou. Listen for what could well be stalking you. This creature is an\nexpert at stealth. A brutal, perfect killer. Any noise you hear, no\nmatter how slight, no matter how seemingly\nnormal, could be the claw step, the tip of the tentacle, the opening\nof the jaws of this monster.\n\n Keep\none ear open, and keep one ear on my voice.\n\n And\nnow, the news.\n\n Citizens\nin Old Town Night Vale are reporting a weird sound. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the\nusual racket of the sun setting (which just seems to get louder every\nday). No. It\xe2\x80\x99s something underground. A \xe2\x80\x9cwum\nwum wum wum.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Here,\nI know. Put your finger in the ear that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a headphone. Go\non, no one is looking. Create a seal around the ear canal. Now\nslightly lift that finger. Now put it back. Slightly up, and then\nsealed again. That is the exact sound Old Town Night Vale is hearing\nfrom below them. Finger slightly up, and then\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Oh.\nOh, no. Somebody saw you with your finger in your ear! That is so\nembarrassing!\nYou must be very embarrassed right now.\n\n Um,\ntry to play it off as an itch. You were just scratching your ear! No\nweird stuff!\n\n (I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think they believed you.)\n\n The\nlocal water utility said that the sound is just routine sewer work,\ndesigned to maintain an efficient waste system in our community, and\nprovide better defenses against the snakes who live in the sewers and\noften come up out of pipes, curled up in toilets and bathtubs,\nwaiting for us. If you are near a bathroom, go ahead and listen for\nsnakes in there. It\xe2\x80\x99s never a bad time to check for that. Head on\nover. Go inside.\n\n Do\nyou hear a snake? No? Okay, the snake that\xe2\x80\x99s in that bathroom is very\nquiet. Quiet snakes are even more dangerous. Simply seal up that\nbathroom ad never go back inside it.\n\n And\nnow, back to the creature that will kill one of my listeners very\nsoon.\n\n Pay\nclose attention to the world around you. Try to pick out the noise of\nthe creature. It could be any\nnoise. Try separating the noises around you by type. The artificial\nsounds: radios, a car engine, a plane engine, a microwave. The\nnatural sounds: birdsong, wind, the rumble of an earthquake. The\nunnatural sounds: ghostly footsteps, the crackle of your aura, a\npsychic scream for help, sent to you by a stranger.\n\n Did\nanything in those sounds seem out of place?\n\n Hmm.\nMaybe instead, sort them by pitch. First, take in the low sounds: the\nrumbles that you feel in the base of you. Then the middle sounds:\nthose that don\xe2\x80\x99t affect you physically, that you only hear\nrather than experience.\nThen the high sounds: those that touch first the teeth and the eyes,\nthat scratch at the ears.\n\n Did\nanything in those sounds seem out of place?\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nvitally important that you identify the out of place sound around\nyou, as just now, a dangerous creature is coming for you. Its eyes\nare on you, from a hidden place, and the only chance you have of\nsurvival is to hear its approach.\n\n What\nwas that sound from behind you? Probably nothing. But better to\ncheck, right?\n\n Of\ncourse, you have one ear covered during all of this. An obvious\nweakness. It knows which side you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear it from, so that is the\nside it will attack. Maybe we should switch sides, see if it has been\ncoming at you from the right this whole time. Put on the other\nheadphone and take this one off.\n\n [From\nleft ear only]\n\n Okay.\nHello from this side. Listen to the sounds coming from your right. Do\nyou hear something like a running toward you, or a hissing growl?\nThat could be it. Do you hear the hum of an air conditioner? That\ncould also be it. It could have switched off your air conditioner,\nand then imitated that dull breathy drone you had long since tuned\nout, using that sound to cover its approach, only seconds now from\nits teeth tearing into your neck!\n\n Okay,\nswitching to this side didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to help anything. Let\xe2\x80\x99s switch\nback. Right headphone in, this one out.\n\n [From\nright side only]\n\n Okay.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go on with the broadcast now, but keep one ear on the\nworld. Death could come at any moment.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is sponsored by a company that makes more than you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\nSure, they\xe2\x80\x99re famous for that one thing, but did you know they make a\nwhole lot more than that? Look around you! Do you see an object that\nimmediately jumps out? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s on the coffee table, or in the cup\nholder of your car, or on the ground next to the quiet country road\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re walking down. Yes, that thing! That\xe2\x80\x99s the one! We made that!\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t you proud of us?\n\n Pick\nit up. Hold it up to your left ear. What do you hear? Does the object\nmake a sound? Is it possible that other sounds you thought were\ncoming from other sources are actually coming from the object itself?\n\n No?\nOh, my! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we very confident about how the world works!\n\n Rub\nit against your face. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that? Because it\xe2\x80\x99s heavy \xe2\x80\x93\nor it was just sitting in the dirt, or because it\xe2\x80\x99s alive. Hey, we\nmade this thing. We made it just for you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ungrateful! Just\ntouch it once to your cheek so you can feel the quality we built into\nit.\n\n Did\nthe sound that it\xe2\x80\x99s making change at all? Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it happy!\nOr angry.\n\n Shake\nit once. Did that change its sound? Did that change its mood? Is it\nmaking a buzzing sound? If it is, put\nit down,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s definitely angry now. Uh, in fact, maybe you picked up the wrong\nthing and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the thing that we make. That might have been a\nwasp nest.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re\nsorry we told you to hold a wasp nest up to your face.\n\n Kleenex.\nWe make more things than you think. But not wasp nests.\n\n Sorry.\n\n And\nnow for the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner. Today we will be\nexploring the mystries of interaction.\n\n Say\nhello. Out loud.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Good!\n\n Did\nanything say \xe2\x80\x9chello\xe2\x80\x9d back? Then you are now in a conversation!\n\n Did\nnothing say \xe2\x80\x9chello\xe2\x80\x9d back? Then you might still be in a\nconversation with something very quiet. Best to be polite and carry\non so as not to rudely call attention to their silence.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d you should say.\n\n Listen\nfor the answer.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nmyself am doing well,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say now. And then say, \xe2\x80\x9cTroubles\nthat once seemed insurmountable turned out to be just a tone of the\nwind, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n See\nif whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation with knows.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nhow are the kids?\xe2\x80\x9d you might ask. Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids, in\nwhich case indicate that you are asking about the general state of\nchildren, the condition of the youth worldwide.\n\n Maybe\nthey recently lost a child, and this is a very painful topic for\nthem.\n\n You\nshould have thought of that. Your words are knives, and like knives,\nthey can be useful and constructive, but with one careless slip they\ncan seriously hurt someone.\n\n You\nshould apologize. Even if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt by these words, they\nmight have been hurt by other words, words you never considered as\npotentially hurtful.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\nsorry,\xe2\x80\x9d you should say now. And then say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, okay. Goodbye.\nSorry again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthat is how interaction works.\n\n This\nhas been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n City\nCouncil is announcing that efforts to capture the terrible creature\nterrorizing Night Vale have not gone well. They fear they won\xe2\x80\x99t be\nable to capture it before it has eaten someone \xe2\x80\x93 someone who is\nlistening to me speak, with one ear, right now.\n\n It\nmight be best if everyone listening to this moved to a different\nlocation. Maybe somewhere else would be safer. If possible, move to a\ndifferent location now. Try to find a new and completely different\nset of sounds to work with. That might help!\n\n It\nprobably won\xe2\x80\x99t. Probably nothing can save you, but worth a shot,\nright?\n\n Have\nyou moved somewhere else? Listen to the new set of sounds available\nto you. Do you hear one specific sound above the rest? Good! City\nofficials believe that sound is safe. Move toward that sound.\n\n Wonderful.\nYou are doing great\xe2\x80\xa6is something it would be good to believe just\nin case you die right now. That way you\xe2\x80\x99ll die thinking something\nhappy.\n\n Get\nas close to the sound as possible. Do you feel safer near it?\n\n Uh-oh.\nCity Council said that they mistyped. By the way, did you know that\nCity Council finally got a cell phone? Just one cell phone. They\nshare one, and so there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fighting over it and most of the\ntexts they send are random letters or the dance emoji over and over.\n\n Anyway.\nTheir text was wrong. That noise is actually very likely the sound of\nthe terrible thing hunting you. You are right on it! Get as far from\nthat noise as you can! Get away now!\n\n For\nthose who weren\xe2\x80\x99t devoured when we accidentally told you to get close\nto the sound, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at traffic.\n\n Traffic\nis really humming along today.\n\n Hey!\nSpeaking of humming, you know how it sounds completely different when\nyou have your ears covered versus when your ears are open? What does\nit sound like when you have half of your ears covered, you do think?\n\n Hum\nto yourself. No, louder than that! We\xe2\x80\x99ll never discover new things\nabout the world if we don\xe2\x80\x99t put ourselves out there!\n\n Oh.\nIf the creature is stalking you, than it already knows exactly where\nyou are. Trying to keep quiet won\xe2\x80\x99t save you.\n\n Hum.\n\n Interesting!\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat that sounds like!\n\n In\nyour own time, compare it to having both ears open and both ears\nclosed.\n\n Also,\na horrible accident on Route 99 happened while I was talking about\nhumming, and the highway is now closed in both directions until\neveryone feels emotionally prepared to drive again.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n Oh\nno! I\xe2\x80\x99m being told via several frantic texts from City Council that\nthe monster is going to attack in just moments!\n\n They\nalso sent another long string of dance emojis.\n\n If\nyou are the target of the monster, then the end of your life is\nimminent. I need you to pay close attention to the sounds of the\nworld around you. I need you to listen for the terrible creature so\nclose to you that its breath could easily be mistaken for a slight\nbreeze, or for a stream of air blowing from a window or a vent.\n\n Turn\naround, slowly, in a circle. If you cannot turn, just pivot your\nhead.\n\n Try\nto identify which of the sounds you hear is going to kill you. When\nyou have heard a sound that seems most likely to kill you, stop and\nface that sound.\n\n Try\nto keep your eyes on the apparent source of the sound. Hope that you\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t guessed wrong. Hope that you are not moments from a fierce\nand sudden pain.\n\n Actually,\non the off chance that you are about to die, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably best you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see it coming. Close your eyes, put your other headphone on.\n\n [From\nboth ears]\n\n Yes.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re listening to me on both sides now. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep our eyes\nclosed, and wait to see if we die.\n\n And\nwhile we wait, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cPlough\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Speedy\nOrtiz]\n\n [From\nright ear only]\n\n Listeners,\nthose who can still hear me, hey! You can still hear me! An you can\nstill hear the world around you! Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re back over here now.\nPlease take the headphone off your other ear so you can savor the\nsounds of the world around you. And your ability to hear them, when\nyou are not dead.\n\n So,\nyou were not eaten by a hidden creature watching from the shadows. A\nfalse alarm, everything is fine.\n\n A\nfalse alarm for you,\nI mean. Not for Night Vale resident Wayne Ferry, who was in fact the\ntarget of the creature, and was horribly devoured during our weather\nforecast. Blood smeared on the wall like an ancient language that can\nexpress only suffering and terror. The dank smell of the beast heavy\nin the air, the signs of its passage in the shattered objects, the\nsmashed walls, and the heavy final absence of Wayne.\n\n So,\nfor everyone else, everything is fine! We got all worried over\nnothing. Whoo!\n\n I\nknow my role. You come to me for escape, loyal listeners. To forget\nabout the world, or\xe2\x80\xa6not to forget\nabout it, but to hear its dangers organized, put into a narrative\nframework, turned into a story that can safely end.\n\n But\nno matter how deeply you enter into the stories I am telling you, you\ncan never fully\nescape. The world is around you. You can hear it with one of your\nears right now.\n\n Listen\nclosely. What you are hearing is not the sound of a monster. There\nare no spirits in that sound. No lurking or lurkers, no stalking or\nstalkers, nothing hunting you. All you were hearing is the sound of\nthe world you live in. And you can put headphones on. You can listen\nto my voice. But you can never fully escape that world. You are\nalways half there, no matter where the rest of you is.\n\n But\nin those sounds, in that inescapable world, there is every joy you\nwill ever experience. Every beautiful person you will ever meet.\nEvery wonderful surprise that will ever wonderfully startle you.\n\n It\nis the good and the bad. It is the sound of the world. A world that\nwill\nkill you, but also a world that will allow you to live.\n\n And\nas you exist in this world, half hearing my half voice, remember:\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re all right. You are alllll right.\n\n All\nright, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: This is Doritos\xe2\x80\x99 world. We just live in it.'
