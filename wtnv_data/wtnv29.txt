Episode 28 - Summer Reading Program
b'Does it even matter how many living things you touch today, or where they all are now?\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n The Summer Reading Program for children and teens has begun at the Night Vale Public Library.\n\n\n This comes as an alarming surprise, given that the program was abolished by the City Council 30 years ago. Though parents and teenagers have asked on several occasions to reinstate the program, the City Council has maintained its position, citing lack of taxpayer funds, the extreme danger posed by books, the peril of exposing children to librarians, and of course, the incident that precipitated the ban \xe2\x80\x93 which the town\xe2\x80\x99s older residents will refer to only as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Time of Knives.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Nevertheless, in a show of civic dedication (or mindless bloodlust, and they really are so similar), Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s librarians have banded together in defiance of authority to reinstate Summer Reading.\n\n\n Colorful posters with appealing statements like \xe2\x80\x9cGet into a good book this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to force you into a good book this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to get inside this book, and we are going to close it on you and there is nothing you can do about it\xe2\x80\x9d have appeared overnight around the library entrance and in local shops and businesses \xe2\x80\x93 all sporting the clever tagline, \xe2\x80\x9cCatch the flesh-eating reading bacterium!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police have responded by interrogating the proprietors of businesses where the posters have appeared, and by removing and confiscating the posters themselves.\n\n\n Although\xe2\x80\xa6to be honest, listeners, the graphic design work is really cute. I mean, have you seen them? The little flesh-eating germ, with his sun hat and library book, using a screaming semi-skeletal human victim as a beach chair? Ugh! Adorable!\n\n\n After fierce debate today, the City Council has officially declared murder illegal \xe2\x80\x93 a crime that has, until this point, been handled using informal vigilante squads. The head of one such squad, Vincent LeFarge of Grab \xe2\x80\x98Em And Sack \xe2\x80\x98Em, argued that Night Vale has gotten along just fine for years, without the government \xe2\x80\x9cmeddling in murder investigation or punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDo we sometimes catch the wrong guy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vincent. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, most of the time. We\xe2\x80\x99re not even sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever caught a guilty one. Usually, we just grab the first person we see. One time, we tried to arrest the dead body\xe2\x80\xa6but it got away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Proponents of the bill argued that most things in Night Vale are already illegal anyway, so citizens would hardly even notice the change. The law goes into effect in two weeks, and citizens are advised to get any necessary murders done before then \xe2\x80\x93 although there will be a three-day grace period after the deadline, for those who are forgetful, or whose victims are hard to catch.\n\n\n Some summer tips to beat the heat:\n\n\n First off, have you tried to reason with the heat? Humans, temperatures, Angels, and chairs are all equally real and sentient \xe2\x80\x93 which is to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re all not real, nor are any of us actually sentient. But give reason a shot. It has never, not once in history worked, but it might just work this time!\n\n\n If the heat won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to reason, try denying that it\xe2\x80\x99s hot.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem hot today,\xe2\x80\x9d you might say to your profusely sweating neighbor. \xe2\x80\x9cA little chilly even,\xe2\x80\x9d you could continue, slipping on a sweater and making an exaggerated \xe2\x80\x9cbrr!\xe2\x80\x9d noise as the glaring sun plants the idea of cancer in your skin.\n\n\n And, if denial does not work, then your best bet \xe2\x80\x93 as with all problems in life \xe2\x80\x93 is exhausted resignation.\n\n\n This has been summer tips to beat the heat.\n\n\n And now a public service announcement:\n\n\n Here is a brief list of everything that is helpful:\n\n\n \n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police\n\n\n Clouds\n\n\n Anger\n\n\n The City Council\n\n\n Affection falling just short of love\n\n\n Ceiling fans\n\n\n Lungs\n\n\n Other sundry organs\n\n\n Laws\n\n\n Government\n\n\n Helicopters\n\n\n The 2005 Honda Accord\n\n\n Secrets\n\n\n Whispers\n\n\n Ultimately, nothing\n\n\n\n Anything not specifically named in this list should be considered not-helpful and potentially dangerous. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just good sense, it\xe2\x80\x99s the law!\n\n\n An update on the Summer Reading situation:\n\n\n 14 young people between the ages of 5 and 17 have already been reported missing, and are feared to be in the Public Library, and possibly learning. Attempts by the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police to enter the library, rescue the missing children, and put an end to all Summer Reading activities have failed, as all doors and windows have mysteriously disappeared from the library exterior \xe2\x80\x93 just like it was before the renovations.\n\n\n Our tax dollars paid for those doors and windows, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to stand for library administrators just deciding to disappear them on a whim \xe2\x80\x93 even for a valid reason, like jealously guarding their possession of our stolen children, without at least putting the issue to a popular vote.\n\n\n Anyway\xe2\x80\xa6in light of this development, the City Council has declared a Level Orange Fear Alert. They advise that all Night Vale citizens avoid the Public Library, and provide the Council with any information they may have on the whereabouts of the missing children, on librarians\xe2\x80\x99 secret weaknesses, or on good books they\xe2\x80\x99ve read lately.\n\n\n Any citizens who admit to having read good books, the Council added in an impromptu press conference, televised from a book-proof bunker, will be immediately scheduled for re-education, and subsequent de-education.\n\n\n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police, meanwhile, have instituted a curfew for the entire town, effective immediately. After 7 p.m., all minors should be at home and under adult supervision, and absolutely no reading, researching, online information seeking, educational games, documentary television, or having a lifelong love of learning will be permitted. As their catchy new slogan puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it gets dark, forget everything you ever knew and be silent. Words belong to our enemies, and our enemies are words. So be as mute and pure as a bone bleached clean by our desert sun. By our desert sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The Police have also stated that any Night Vale citizen encountering a librarian, an entity suspected of being a librarian, or any excessively organized and helpful individual with a working comprehension of information systems is encouraged to shoot on sight.\n\n\n They also added this goes for teachers as well, since \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the hell, as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re at it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ll have further updates on this story as it develops.\n\n\n And now a word from our sponsors:\n\n\n Congratulations! You are eligible for a free 30-day trial! This free 30-day trial comes with everything you need, including a free arrest, free charges, free arraignment, and free conviction, guaranteed! Shipping and handling not included. Defense lawyer also not included. We have you surrounded. The more you struggle, the worse it will be for you. Put that down. Put it down! Put that down.\n\n\n This message brought to you whether you like it or not.\n\n\n The Freemasons have announced some changes to their hierarchy. These changes are the following:\n\n\n Whereas before the Freemasons were under the authority of the Stonemasons Worldwide, they will now be an independent subsidiary of the Hallowed Mason Council, which itself will be split into four branches, corresponding with the four directions we glance when nervous. The Hallowed Mason Council will also provide guidance and financial support to the Retail Masons, the Wholesale Masons, and the Discount Masons \xe2\x80\x93 except in cases involving inter-Masonry disputes, which will, as before, be subject to the Small Brotherhood of the Large Chamber, the Large Brotherhood of the Small Chamber, or the Properly-Fitted Brotherhood, depending on the patterns discerned in bones, cast by a fully licensed member of the Masonic Drone Legion, or one of their proxies.\n\n\n Now, of course, the Masons will continue their proud fraternal associations with the Illuminati. However, the Illuminati will itself be splitting into ten distinct factions as follows: Red, Green, Eagle, Faction Four, the Real Illuminati, the Other Real Illuminati, Red Again, Alpha, Windhind, and Hungry Man Brand Frozen Foods Officially-Sponsored Illuminati.\n\n\n This split will be overseen by the Council of Three, which will be supported by the Council of Five, and monitored by the Council of Zero. Elections for the Council of Zero will be held never and will result in nothing.\n\n\n Discretionary funds for the Illuminati and Freemason Alliance Committee will be funneled through a number of secret bank accounts, their numbers known to no one and their secrets kept forever.\n\n\n All of this is in accordance with the General Secret Agreement of the General Secret Alliance of the General Secret Community, representing all brotherhoods and organizations obscure and hidden, including the Harpoon League, the Flying Cape, the Six Ancient Truths, and the Dental Underground.\n\n\n The Freemasons would also like to remind you that none of this may be known to you, and that they are only telling you this to demonstrate your fragile mind, which barely parsed the words as they were spoken, and have already forgotten the secrets contained just moments later. You will never know anything, and you will not even know that.\n\n\n Breaking news:\n\n\n Despite the best efforts of the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police and citizenry, we have received confirmation that over 100 children and adolescents have disappeared from their homes, beds, part-time jobs, or summer forced-labor camps, and are now presumed to be inside the Night Vale Public Library, and subject to the Summer Reading Program.\n\n\n Unfortunately, it is my sad duty to announce that this includes Intern Paolo \xe2\x80\x93 a high school junior who\xe2\x80\x99s been helping to organize the radio station archives over the summer months. To the parents and family of Paolo: our hearts go out to you in this time of fear and uncertainty, as in all other times of fear and uncertainty, which is all of them, really. May you find comfort in the knowledge that, though your son may have been lost in a library, at least he \xe2\x80\x93 unlike many of his peers \xe2\x80\x93 actually went inside one of those at least once.\n\n\n The situation has\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\xa6wait.\n\n\n Hold on just one moment.\n\n\n I beg your pardon, listeners, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve just received alarming news. An alert citizen has called in to report inhuman shrieking, thick meaty sounds, and a coppery, rotten smell of gore and viscera coming from the now-sealed and impenetrable Night Vale Public Library \xe2\x80\x93 which are, of course, all fairly standard elements of the Summer Reading Program as described in the library director\xe2\x80\x99s original proposal.\n\n\n Painful though it may be, it seems that all we can do now \xe2\x80\x93 as so often in our dull blinkered lives below a microcosm of horror and beauty \xe2\x80\x93 is wait. Wait, and hope, and know that our hopes are immaterial and powerless, and our wishes will go unheard by the indifferent multitude of stars, if indeed they (the stars) are even real.\n\n\n But there are still some comforts that remain to us while we wait. Small, shining baubles to distract us from the endless march of time towards events we have no control over and outcomes we never imagined.\n\n\n And so, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cYou And I Belong\xe2\x80\x9d by Simone Felice]\n\n\n This just in, listeners:\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve received reports that the entrances to the Night Vale Public Library have reappeared, and the missing children have begun to emerge from inside the building. The children have been described as wild-eyed, feral, some staggering upright, and some running on all fours like animals, caked in effluvia and far more emaciated than the time of their absence would seem to account for\xe2\x80\xa6but otherwise, well, healthy, and unharmed.\n\n\n At the head of the dazed and shambling pack was their apparent chosen leader, 12-year-old Tamika Flynn \xe2\x80\x93 her mouth clenched in a blood-crusted snarl, and carrying the severed head of a librarian in one hand, and a gore-streaked sticker chart in the other. Eyewitnesses who dared to get close enough to read the chart reported that Tamika had even finished \xe2\x80\x9cCry, The Beloved Country,\xe2\x80\x9d which is very impressive for her reading level. Well done, Tamika!\n\n\n Indeed, congratulations are in order for all the young people of Night Vale who participated in the Summer Reading Program, for proving that neither abduction nor captivity, neither horrors beyond imagining nor unfamiliar vocabulary can prevent you from embracing the pleasures of belles-lettres.\n\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s to you, boys and girls, and remember: even while we congratulate Tamika for winning your loyalty with her sophisticated comprehension and extremes of berserker violence, that the real victory won today has been for literacy.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for our countdown of last words, from \xe2\x80\x9cStop telling me how to drive\xe2\x80\x9d all the way to \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb:\xc2\xa0A bar walks into a bar. The bartender is a snake eating its own tail. The windows look out only onto the face of the one who looks.'
