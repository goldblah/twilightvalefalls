The Investigators
b"Meg Bashwiner:\nAnd now, listeners of every kind, the voice of Night Vale, Cecil\nBaldwin!\n\n Cecil:\nThe writing is on the wall. It is not written in English. It is not\nreally even written. Clawed, more like. The claw marks are on the\nwall.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\n\n Listeners, be\nwarned: There is a murderer in our midst!\n\n Ooh! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\nthat \xc2\xa0was mega-dramatic of me. Let me start off with some\npleasantries.\n\n Hello. My name is\nCecil. Welcome to my show, here on Night Vale Community Radio. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot some news and stuff coming up for you soon. Um, how are things\ngoing with you?\n\n I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear\nyou\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear\nyou\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n No, really, I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t hear you because I\xe2\x80\x99m all by myself here in my radio studio, but\nI hope that you were yelling your heads off out there in your homes\nand offices and cars and witching caves.\n\n Now that the\nsmall talk is out of the way, quick bit of news.\n\n Be warned,\ncitizens! There is a murderer in our midst!\n\n \nLast night, at the corner of Sausalito and Somerset, a body was\nfound. Police suspect foul play. Well, specifically they suspect\nmurder, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get you all upset, and \xe2\x80\x98foul play\xe2\x80\x99\nsounds so much less alarming and more fun!\n\n \nA Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police spokesperson said \xe2\x80\x9cMurder is just so\nfinal, you know? So scary. We like 'foul play.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s like people were\nhaving fun, like a game\xe2\x80\xa6but a little bit rougher. But yeah, anyway,\nsomebody died pretty violently from\xe2\x80\xa6foul play. And it\xe2\x80\x99s really\ngross! But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, the first rule of any murder investigation is\nto immediately clean up that murder scene and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s tidy,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe spokesperson said.\n\n \nAs is the usual murder investigation procedure, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nPolice is ordering every single citizen of Night Vale to gather in\nthe Rec Center for a mandatory night of murder mystery dinner\ntheater\xe2\x80\xa6so they can determine the killer\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\n\n \nThere will be catering by Big Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza, and the Moonlite All-Nite\nDiner will be providing invisible pie for those citizens that do not\neat visible food.\n\n \nMore on this soon. But first, a word from our sponsors.\n\n \nToday\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is Evian. Here on their behalf is, of course, a\nsentient patch of haze, and her name is Deb.\n\n \nDeb?\n\n Deb:\nDon'tcha know it, Cecil.\n\n \nOkay, listeners. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to tell you all about Evian brand water\nbeverage, and I certainly do hope that you consider Evian brand water\nbeverage over all other water beverage opportunities that are\navailable to you.\n\n \nI know that you humans, insignificant meat-filled wisps that you are,\nare probably thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference could the water beverage\nopportunity I select possibly make?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re right. You\xe2\x80\x99re very smart. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsure that all other water beverage opportunities haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen poisoned by unknown malicious parties, leaving Evian brand water\nbeverage the only safe selection. Why would that even happen? That\nwould be illegal. Immoral. And great for our sales.\n\n \nMarketing a particular brand of water beverage is certainly very\ndifficult. You know what else is difficult? Death by poison. Hard,\nslow, and painful.\n\n \nYes, if all other water beverage opportunities were poisoned, why\nthen your choice to select Evian brand water beverage would be very\nimportant indeed.\n\n Cecil:\nNow, Deb, please tell me the truth. Did you poison our water?\n\n Deb:\nOh, Cecil. Not to my definitive out-loud knowledge. But who even\nknows?\n\n Cecil:\nUh, I feel like you\nknow.\n\n Deb:\nThen maybe just follow that feeling. See where it takes you. Maybe\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to Evian brand water beverage. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99ll take you\ninto a slow oblivion. The important thing is, nothing you do could\npossibly affect me. As the good book says, human life: it\xe2\x80\x99s just a\nmeans to an end.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, the good book?\n\n Deb:\nThe Sentient Haze\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to World Domination. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great book.\n\n \nEvian brand water beverage. Can\xe2\x80\x99t live without un-poisoned water.\n\n Cecil:\nNow, listeners, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re all at a dinner theater, but\nperhaps avoid drinking anything with your food until we have this\nwhole situation sorted out.\n\n Deb:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n\n Cecil:\nYyyeah, but still, though, just to be on the safe side, you might\nwant to\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Deb\n[whispering]:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n\n \nOh, okay, all right. Well, thank you very much, Deb!\n\n \nAnd now, a public service announcement.\n\n \nThe Night Vale Psychological Association reminds you to take a few\nmoments each day for relaxing your brain. Never tried meditative\nexercises? They suggest the following:\n\n \nFirst, close your eyes. Breathe. Think about your breaths. In and\nout.\n\n \nNext, picture a beach. Picture gentle waves, and then wet sand, and\nthen dry sand, and then dune grass, flittering in a soft wind. And\nthen, a house. Picture a house. A really big house.\n\n \nNo, bigger than that. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking at least 3,000 square feet. Ooh,\npicture, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, a 3,500 square foot house, bedroom-wise. Three\nbathrooms\xe2\x80\xa6like two and a half. Okay?\n\n \nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re relaxing, and we\xe2\x80\x99re breathing. And we\xe2\x80\x99re picturing a 3,500\nsquare foot craftsman style house with a wraparound porch and a porch\nswing. And we are picturing our best selves, living our beset lives.\nWe are picturing a calm ocean.\n\n \nWe are picturing a media room with a back-projection screen and\nreclining movie seats.\n\n \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s really relax now. Let\xe2\x80\x99s feel very calm.\n\n \nAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s put a massage function on those movie seats!\n\n \nWe should now be feeling warmth prickling throughout our bodies, and\nwe allow ourselves to follow that warmth. We\xe2\x80\x99re picturing peace,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re picturing love, love of every kind.\n\n \nWe are also picturing a wine cellar.\n\n \nNo no no no no, we are picturing a better wine cellar that that!\nWe are picturing a modern humidity-stabilized temperature controlled\nwine cellar, come on! Work with me on this!\n\n \nAnd peace. We\xe2\x80\x99re also picturing peace.\n\n \nYeah! This is really coming together! We\xe2\x80\x99re all doing a great job\npicturing this house with the strong foundation, like our spiritual\nfoundations, grounded and stable. With a good roof, like our minds,\nsheltering and waterproof and recently redone by a certified\ncontractor. With a walk-in closet off the master bedroom, like our\nhearts, finished with recessed lighting and a rotating shoe rack.\n\n \nPicture this house. Build this house in your mind. Have you\npictured the house? Great.\n\n \nYou can open your eyes now. Thanks. You\xe2\x80\x99ve just built the Night Vale\nPsychological Association a luxury beach house in your subconscious.\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve already put it up on Airbnb! But we hope to have a few\nweekends a year to use it for ourselves. Every time you fall asleep,\nyou might see strangers gathering in this house, living in your\ndreams.\n\n \nKeep doing those relaxation exercises. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want our dream world\nbeach house spoiled by your weird mother issues.\n\n \nThanks.\n\n \nThis message was brought to you by the Night Vale Psychological\nAssociation.\n\n \nSo, a spokesperson from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police has just handed\nme a note explaining that I am not required to attend the murder\nmystery dinner theater, as I was here in my booth broadcasting during\nthe time of the murder.\n\n \nOh. Um, they just handed me another note, but it reads, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow where that scientist is. Please let the scientist know he is\nrequired to attend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \nNow, look. Carlos has been busy all day in his science\nlab\xe2\x80\xa6science-ing. If, if he were even able to leave the lab,\nhe would certainly not just murder a stranger\xe2\x80\xa6without stopping by\nthe radio station to say hello to me first!\n\n \nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna call Carlos right now.\n\n Carlos:\nHey, you! I was just thinking of you.\n\n Cecil:\nHi, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry to bother you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve received some bad news from\nthe Secret Police.\n\n Carlos:\nUgh. I knew this would eventually happen. They discovered that my\nteam of scientists is studying geology, right? I know, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nillegal. And, as Francis Scott Key wrote in his famous poem, \xe2\x80\x9cRocks\nare just rocks! Mind your own business, pal!\xe2\x80\x9d But I find geology so\nscientifically interesting, I cannot believe that they just\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Cecil:\nNo no no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s been a murder, and the\nSheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police need you to attend the mandatory murder\nmystery dinner theater.\n\n Carlos:\nOh. But that is great news! Um, I love dinner theaters. I, um, I took\nsome theater in college, you know, so I can play, like, a bunch of\ndifferent roles.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, really?\n\n Carlos:\nYeah, okay. So the part that everyone\nwants to play in a murder mystery dinner theater, you know who it is?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the butler.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Carlos:\nBecause the butler gets to wear pastel tuxedos and carry this pet\nrat. Ooh! And I can do, like, a really\nreally good snooty British accent. Ahem.\n\n [In an accent\nthat\xe2\x80\xa6well I\xe2\x80\x99m not good with accents, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not\nBritish.] \xe2\x80\x9c'Ey! I would never\nmurder anyone! Might I perhaps take your coat, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s really a British\naccent.\n\n Carlos:\nBabe, it is.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, is it?\n\n Carlos:\nYeah. Mm-hmm.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay. All right.\n\n Carlos:\nSo, like, another great role in the murder mystery dinner theater is\nthe rich heiress. Ah! The rich heiress! Um, okay. She gets to wear\nthis like tight black dress, and pearls, and a feathered boa (which\nyou know look amazing in).\n\n Cecil:\nI do.\n\n Carlos:\nI do. So, the rich heiress, of course, she seems\nlike the murderer, because she always carries around this old\nbloodstained axe, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing! She only carries the ax\nbecause her mother was the owner of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest axe\nmanufacturing conglomerate, and their family made a great fortune by\nchopping up people and taking all their money. Anyway, the rich\nheiress has this glorious and smooth Romanian accent.\n\n [Takes a few\npuffs of an imaginary cigarette]\n\n [In another\naccent that I won\xe2\x80\x99t guess, but it is not glorious, nor is it smooth]\nPlease know that I would never murder anyone. Now go get me another\ndrink doll. Chop chop! I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding. [Takes one last puff of\nimaginary cigarette and exhales loudly]\n\n Cecil:\nOhhhh! Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to Romania\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Carlos:\nBabe, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dead-on accent.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, okay. All right. Now, listen, Carlos, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually really\nsurprised to hear this side of you. I mean, I had no idea that you\nwere such a theater nerd!\n\n Carlos:\nYeah! Like, I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist, sure, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not all\nI am, you know?\n\n Cecil:\nYeah?\n\n Carlos:\nLike, getting to act in a murder mystery dinner theater would give me\nthe chance to be\xe2\x80\xa6not\na scientist anymore, you know? Like, um, like, like I could be\nanyone! Like\xe2\x80\xa6like a train conductor, and I\xe2\x80\x99d shout \xe2\x80\x9cAll aboard!\xe2\x80\x9d\nUm, or a pizza maker, and I would shout, \xe2\x80\x9cAll aboard, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\npizza!\xe2\x80\x9d Um, or, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, like, oh! Like a writer! And I\xe2\x80\x99d\nshout \xe2\x80\x9cI am alone, so terribly alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nCarlos, I\xe2\x80\x93 I think the idea is that everybody is just themselves,\nso that way the police can easily scan the crowd and find out who\nlooks the most guilty. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that murder mystery\ndinner theater is ever supposed to be fun!\nThey are grueling exercises in abrupt and arbitrary justice.\n\n Carlos:\nYou know who I want to play? I want to play a librarian.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Carlos:\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be very interested in young adult sci-fi adventure\nnovels. Might I recommend Get\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Yours: The Secret to Maxing Out Your Social Security by\nJohn Grisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Whoo!\nThat felt really good.\n\n Cecil:\nIt sounded good.\n\n Carlos:\nThank you. But I would really, really need to work with the director,\nyou know, on how to get the pincers and all the long hairy legs just\nright. Ooh! Ooh! And we would really\nneed to rig up a pulley system so that I could fly around the room\nand then descend from the ceiling like a normal librarian.\n\n Cecil:\nOh! Um, Carlos, I was just handed another not from the Secret Police\nthat reads: \xe2\x80\x9cNo more, please! Tell him he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come to\nthe dinner theater at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Carlos:\n\xe2\x80\xa6But I wanted to come.\n\n Cecil:\nAww.\n\n Carlos:\nUm, eh, it\xe2\x80\x99s no bother.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, we will just have to put on our own murder mystery dinner\ntheater this weekend.\n\n Carlos:\nOkay. Um, I love you.\n\n Cecil:\nAll right. I love you too.\n\n Carlos:\nOoh! Ooh! You want to hear my Steve Carlsberg impression?\n\n Cecil:\nGoodbye, Carlos.\n\n Carlos:\nOkie-doke.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police has decreed that they will not have\nCarlos perform after all. Despite the fact that Carlos is a great\nactor, a wonderful\nactor, quote, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most charismatic and gripping stage\nperformers of his generation,\xe2\x80\x9d end quote\xe2\x80\xa6is what I imagine they\nwere thinking, when they sent me this note that says \xe2\x80\x9cHey, please\ntell Carlos he\xe2\x80\x99s not allowed inside the theater.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they\nsigned it with a less-than symbol and the number 3. <3\n\n The\nSecret Police will instead be presenting a very traditional murder\nmystery dinner theater, in which the audience just stares at each\nother in suspicious silence for a long time, and then goes home.\n\n And,\nindeed, everyone in the crowd was already looking around them for\nsomeone that they suspected of murder. Each one of them was looking\naround for someone that they thought might be a murderer. Now, they\nlooked past those people that they came with, or people who they\nmight already know, because well, they foolishly trusted those\npeople.\n\n No\nno no no. They sought out the eyes of a complete stranger. And then,\nwhen they made eye contact with that stranger, they locked in,\nstaring at that person and only\nat that person, each one of them thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, that person could\nbe a murderer!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen each one of them pointed at that person, and each one of them\nsaid, out loud, \xe2\x80\x9cYou could be a murderer!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\neach one of them was right. That person could\nbe a murderer! And then, keeping their fingers pointed, each one of\nthem narrowed their eyes, and then they widened their eyes, and then\nthey crossed their eyes, and then they uncrossed their eyes because\nit made it very difficult to keep an eye on the person they suspected\nof murder, and then slowly they lowered their pointing fingers, and\neach one of them said, out loud to the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my eye on\nyou, suspect!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen they looked away, their hearts aglow at a job well done. But\nthey would remember the face of that stranger, because they knew it\nwould be important throughout the evening.\n\n Listeners,\nI know that many of you remember Intern Roheet, and the important\nlessons that he learned (well, that we all\nlearned) about which spiders are safe to put inside your mouth.\nRoheet was a good intern, and he will be missed.\n\n But,\ngood news! We have a brand new intern! Welcome to the radio station.\n\n Intern\nJoseph: Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m intern Joseph\nFink. Wait\xe2\x80\xa6wait, no, this can\xe2\x80\x99t be happening!\n\n Cecil:\nNah, nothing ever can.\n\n Joseph:\nNo, I remember this place without ever having been here. These gray\nwalls, that old table yellowed in a semicircular patch where you\xe2\x80\x99ve\nrested your arms for so many years, the water stains on the drop\nceiling, that small nest of owls over there in the corner\xe2\x80\xa6I\nrecognize all of this. No!\n\n Cecil:\nIs someone having a case of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu?\n\n Joseph:\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. There was this river that ran through my college\ndorm room (naturally), and one day, in the river, I found a stone \xe2\x80\x93\nsmooth on one side, rough on the other. I picked up the stone and in\nthat craggy side, I saw a face, and it told me that it granted\nwishes.\n\n So\nI made a wish, and the face in the stone said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Why did you\ndo that?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you said you granted wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthe face said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t grant wishes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did I say\nwishes? I meant curses. I cast curses. I curse you to see your own\ndeath and to know it forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nin the smooth side of the stone, my death was shown to me. Every last\nbloody and terrifying detail.\n\n Cecil:\nCoooool!\n\n [Awkward\npause]\n\n Oh,\nwait, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I was just caught up in your story. It was very\ngood.\n\n Joseph:\nSo now, here I am in the studio. I mean, did I even apply for an\ninternship here? Why would I do that? Why would anyone do that?!?\n\n In\nthat stone, I saw you introduce me to your listeners. I saw myself\ntelling this story to you, exactly as I am now, verbatim, as if\nreading from a script. I saw all of this as a vibrant memory, cause\nand effect reversed by that awful rock. And now comes the terrible\npain of an imminent and all-too-familiar death.\n\n Cecil:\nNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so dramatic. You are not about to die! You are going to\nbe\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Joseph:\nOw!\n\n Cecil:\nOh! What? What is it?\n\n Joseph:\nI bumped my leg on the side of your desk.\n\n Cecil:\nAugh! You scared me, I thought that something serious had\xe2\x80\x93 oh my\nGod, you are bleeding everywhere!\n\n Joseph:\nOkay, yes. I remember seeing the part where I bleed a lot. Why do you\nhave a desk made entirely out of knives?!?\n\n Cecil:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know! That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s just how IKEA makes them.\n\n Joseph:\nThe end is nigh.\n\n Cecil:\nNo! Nooooo! The end is not nigh, Intern Joseph, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make it!\n\n Joseph:\nTell my family I loved them.\n\n Cecil:\nI will tell them, but first, can I just\xe2\x80\xa6can I ask you one thing?\nUm, what did you wish for from the stone, and\xe2\x80\x93 and I will do my\nbest to honor your wish, no matter what happens.\n\n Joseph:\nWait. This is not how I die. I don\xe2\x80\x99t bleed to death. There was\nsomething else.\n\n Cecil:\nThere wa\xe2\x80\x93 ju\xe2\x80\x93 just tell me your wish before you go. It\xe2\x80\x93 It\xe2\x80\x93\nwould it\xe2\x80\x93 it would kill\nme not to know. I\xe2\x80\x93 [Gasps]\xe2\x80\xa6I\nwould hate never to\nknow.\n\n Joseph:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s totally not the bleeding that kills me.\n\n Cecil:\nJust tell me the wish!\n\n Joseph:\nWhat kills me is\xe2\x80\xa6the\xe2\x80\xa6AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\n\n Cecil:\nListeners\xe2\x80\xa6I do not know how a shark got into my radio station. Nor\ndo I know how it got back out again. But to the family of Intern\nJoseph, ahh\xe2\x80\xa6he was a good intern, and he died doing what he loved:\nliving in perpetual fear of death.\n\n I\nonly wish I knew his wish! [Gasps]\nYou know what? I bet it was an Xbox! And so I shall purchase myself\nan Xbox in his honor.\n\n But\nfirst, the Community Calendar.\n\n Wednesday\nevening Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s most popular restaurant, Tourniquet, will be\nhosing a special chef\xe2\x80\x99s table dinner. This exclusive event costs\n$500, and is limited to only 13 attendees. Diners will enjoy a\nspecial tasting menu personally curated and prepared by chef LaShawn\nMason. The five course menu will center around quail. Chef Mason\nrediscovered the joy of quail meat, and would like to share this joy\nwith Night Vale. Sous chef Earl Harlan will recite instructions for\ngutting and cleaning, and each diner will be given a live quail and a\nbrick. The chef\xe2\x80\x99s table dinner begins at 7:30, at which time all\ndiners from last year\xe2\x80\x99s event will finally be released from the\nkitchen back to their old lives.\n\n This\nThursday night, the Night Vale Tourism Board is holding an opening\nnight party to celebrate the new artwork on display at the Night Vale\nVisitor\xe2\x80\x99s Center \xe2\x80\x93 you know, out by Radon Canyon. The theme of this\ngallery collection is \xe2\x80\x9cPain. Internal, External, and Beyond!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nit features work by several local artists, expressing a wide array of\npopular art techniques from postmodern monochromatics to outdoor rock\nsculptures, and even a few interactive exhibits like \xe2\x80\x9cPut Your Foot\nIn There\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHurts, Don\xe2\x80\x99t It?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cStop Hitting Yourself!\nStop Hitting Yourself! Stop Hitting Yourself! Why Do You Keep Hitting\nYourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Say,\ndid you know that it is completely possible for the human body to\nsurvive unprotected in space for several seconds? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s true! And\nthis information will be super useful to you this Thursday night at\n8:00pm, so\xe2\x80\xa6lock it in, all right? Cool.\n\n Aw,\nFriday at noon, the eastbound lanes of Route 800 will be closed\nbetween exits 17 and 19. All traffic will be rerouted onto side\nstreets. Highway crews will be posting signs with \xe2\x80\x9cAll Roads\nNowhere and Every Path DEATH\xe2\x80\x9d and also just a couple of frowny\nfaces to help you with your morning commute.\n\n Oh!\nSaturday afternoon, the Night Vale PTA is hosting its third annual\nyouth arts fair. For more on this we go now to\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Oh,\nno.\n\n Steve\nCarlsberg: Hey, Cecil! Thanks\nfor having me on!\n\n Cecil:\nSteve Carlsberg, secretary of the PTA.\n\n Steve:\nAlso chair of the youth arts fair committee.\n\n Cecil:\nNo one asked.\n\n Steve:\nOkay. Well, thanks for featuring our event on your show, Cecil. It\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing to be a great time! Diane Crayton, Susan Willman, and I have\nput together a lot of new activities this year. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a station\nfor finger painting, and another for face painting, and another for\ncasting bronze idols, and because it was such a huge hit last year, a\ndeath pit!\n\n Cecil:\nWait, what? There\xe2\x80\x99s a\ndeath pit at a kid\xe2\x80\x99s fair?\n\n Steve:\nWell, yeah, we fill it with plastic balls.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay, I guess, then.\n\n Steve:\nThe youth arts fair focuses on creativity, fun, and personal\nexpression for kids. But listen, because of what happened last year,\nwe need to provide a clear warning that there will\nbe clowns at the youth arts fair.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat happened last year?\n\n Steve:\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m your brother-in-law, you can tell me!\n\n Steve:\nNo no, I literally\ncannot talk about it. We all had to go to City Hall for reeducation.\nIt was apparently that bad.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Steve:\nAnyway, because of\xe2\x80\xa6whatever happened, many children are still a\nlittle bit mildly terrified of clowns. But you know how powerful the\nNight Vale Clown Union Local 189 is, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:I\ndo.\n\n Steve:\n\xe2\x80\xa6like any public event, we were required to hire a minimum of two\ndozen clowns.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Steve:\nHowever, for the sake of the easily frightened kids, the clowns will\nnot be allowed into the actual fair. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stand inside the\nelementary school, watching from the darkened rooms. Peering through\nthe narrow gaps in the blinds. The clowns will be just barely\ndiscernible in the shadows, and thus not a distraction for the\nchildren, who\xe2\x80\x99ll only be able to see the faint shadows of curly wigs\nand round noses and sharp yellow teeth, from behind the\nbreath-frosted glass of the rooms the children must sit in day after\nday.\n\n Cecil:\nYes, I remember, when I was a kid, our guidance counselor wore clown\nmakeup, and would hide inside closets with the door cracked, and just\nso we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get scared, he would make little growling gurgling\nsounds. Just so that we knew he was there, and everything was okay.\n\n Steve:\nYes. That was wise behavior. It\xe2\x80\x99s important, you see, that kids are\ngiven the chance to trust clowns.\n\n Cecil:Mm-hmm.\n\n Steve:\nHey, you know what I love, is that funny clown thing where they\xe2\x80\x99re\nreally funny, but, uh, they\xe2\x80\x99re crying too?\n\n [Cecil and\nSteve laugh]\n\n Cecil:\nOh my gosh, yes, I love that. It's\xe2\x80\x93 it's\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s hysterical!\n\n Steve:\nOh, it gets me every time! Ha-ha! Seein\xe2\x80\x99 somebody cry? Seeing their\nshoulders shake and their face fall!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, right, right, right. Right, right. Like we\xe2\x80\x99re laughing and\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re crying, and they\xe2\x80\x99re like, holding up photos of people that\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve loved and they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, and they\xe2\x80\x99re crying over it!\n\n Steve:\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re laughing! It\xe2\x80\x99s irony!\n\n Cecil:\nAnd irony is the best kind of humor because it\xe2\x80\x99s so insincere!\n\n [Cecil and\nSteve laugh, then simultaneously \xe2\x80\x9cahh\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\n Steve:\nSo yeah, anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a lot of fun. Hey, Slenderman is even\ngoing to be there!\n\n Cecil:\nOooooooh! Principal Angela Slenderman is going to be there? That\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreat!\n\n Steve:\nYeah-huh, yeah. Hey, also, I wanted to mention, very qui\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Cecil:\nNope. Out of time. Goodbye, Steve Carlseberg.\n\n God,\nthat guy can talk forever,\nright? Ugh. So sorry about that, listeners.\n\n Steve:\nUh, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually still on the line, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\n\xe2\x80\xa6Yeah, I know.\n\n Steve:\nOh, heh. Okie dokie! Just checking. You know.\n\n Cecil\n[whispering]: Steve is the\nworst!\n\n Steve:\nNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m still\xe2\x80\xa6I can hear it. Every single word.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, you can hang up now, Steve.\n\n Steve:\nO-o-o-okie dokie. I\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Cecil\n[whispering]: Shhhh. Hang up the\nphone.\n\n Steve\n[whispering]: Okie dokie.\n\n Cecil:\nUgh. So.\n\n Sunday\nafternoon, the Night Vale Community Players will be hosting auditions\nfor their next show, which is called \xe2\x80\x9cOklahoma.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s an old\nmusical about people from a fictional U.S. state that must fight off\nan attack from ballet dancing farmers \xe2\x80\x93 farmers that ride a herd of\nelephants with corn husks for eyes. This controversial musical has\nbeen lauded and derided by theater critics for its graphic and gory\ndeath scenes. Auditions are from 2:00pm to 2:05pm, and a postcard\nannouncing the exact location of the auditions will be sent the day\nbefore, so make sure that you wait silently in the shrubbery for your\nmail carrier.\n\n Tuesday\nis a lie! Calendars are propaganda! Days and times are just\nartificial walls built to divide us! [Cecil makes an\nexplosion sound] It\xe2\x80\x99s true.\n\n And\nnow, an update from the Rec Center. Everyone in town is still\nparticipating in the murder mystery dinner theater, and the evening\nis certainly providing a lot of theater, dinner, mystery, and\nunfortunately, murder.\n\n It\nseems that whoever is the culprit in this case is working to expand\nthe number of cases that they are a culprit in. They have taken\nadvantage of the fact that all citizens are required to be at this\ndinner theater production, and are slinking about in the shadows,\npicking people off one by one.\n\n Janice\nRio (from down the street) said that Bernie Simpson had been right\nnext to her, and then the next thing she knew, bam!\nBernie Simpson was right next to her.\n\n And\nthen she paused for a really long time, as though expecting a\nreaction, and then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry! I forgot to say\nthat Bernie was a ghost\nthe second time! Yeah, he was a ghost and he winked at me, and he\nsmile, and he said, 'Hey, Janice, looks like I\xe2\x80\x99ve been murdered!\xe2\x80\x99 and\nhe laughed and laughed, and then he said 'Well, they got me. I\xe2\x80\x99m dead\nnow!\xe2\x80\x99 And it was so off-putting I had to change seats!\xe2\x80\x9d Janice\nsaid.\n\n Who\nis this fiend? Where will they strike next? It could be anyone. It\ncould be anywhere. It is like that wonderful children\xe2\x80\x99s\nbook classic, in which the reader is playfully reminded again and\nagain that there\xe2\x80\x99s a monster at the end of the book, but then of\ncourse when the reader gets to the end of the book it turns out that\nthere is indeed a monster and our children are eaten after reading\nit! Wait, that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful\nbook!\n\n Anyway,\ncitizens, I urge you to please be safe. I would be so very upset if\nyou were not safe, so just\xe2\x80\xa6you know, please.\n\n In\nlight of the current emergency, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police has sent\na spokesperson to the radio station to provide information and answer\nany questions that might be raised about the current \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous\nmurderer on the loose in the room that you are all\xe2\x80\x9d in situation.\nAnd the spokesperson has just pushed their soft wet snout out from\nthe soil, and has, uh, used their long digging claws to tunnel their\nway into my booth.\n\n So,\nplease say hello to the Secret Spokseperson.\n\n Spokesperson:\nYes\xe2\x80\xa6what?\n\n Cecil:\nUh\xe2\x80\xa6well, you\xe2\x80\x99re hear to speak to us about the dangerous situation?\n\n Spokesperson:\nOh, sure, sure. Citizens, we\xe2\x80\x99re completely in charge, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\nto fear.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, well that\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Spokesperson:\nAhh!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, what?\n\n Spokesperson:\nSorry. I just thought of something really frightening.\n\n Cecil:\nOh. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Spokesperson:\nOh my God!\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, now what is it?\n\n Spokesperson:\nOh, y'know, I was just remembering how I was thinking of something\nfrightening, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about remembering it. Because,\ntruly, fear devours.\n\n Anyway,\nthe investigation is moving forward, and we have got our best\nofficers on it. And all of the other officers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t on it are\nbusy worrying that apparently they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best officers. Are they\nthe worst? This will keep them up at night. They will toss, and they\nwill turn\xe2\x80\xa6thus you can see everything is under control. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nworry. I\xe2\x80\x99m great at not worrying. You\nmight worry, though. It all depends on how well you deal with the\nstress of being in great danger.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, well, how close are the Secret Police to identifying a major\nsuspect?\n\n Spokesperson:\nOh, man. Whoo! That is some entitlement if I have ever heard it!\n\n Cecil:\nEntitlement?\n\n Spokesperson:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to stop this murderer! Like having a\nmurder mystery dinner theater, even announcing that there was some\nfoul play, well just this afternoon we ran through a neighborhood\ncrying out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re done for! You\xe2\x80\x99re all done for!\xe2\x80\x9d And now\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re saying 'name a suspect?\xe2\x80\x99 'Make an arrest?\xe2\x80\x99 'Keep us safe?\xe2\x80\x99 You\nare fine. You are all\nfine.\n\n Probably.\n\n Listen,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re either already dead, or you\xe2\x80\x99re fine for this exact moment.\n\n Cecil:\nUmm, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like we\xe2\x80\x99re safe.\n\n Spokesperson\n[interrupting]: Uh \xe2\x80\x93 Uh \xe2\x80\x93 Uh\n\xe2\x80\x93 Uh \xe2\x80\x93 I understand your concern, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nB\xe2\x80\xa6 And?\n\n Spokesperson:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I understand it, it seems valid. Good concern. \n\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Spokesperson:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna head back to the Secret Police hover-office in the clouds\nuntil it gets a little less dangerous around here.\n\n Cecil:\nNo, wait. You\xe2\x80\x99re just gonna go hide?\n\n Spokesperson:\nNo.\n\n Cecil:\nOh! But you \xe2\x80\x93 augh! You just nodded!\n\n Spokesperson:\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like something I would do. All right, citizens, we\nare out of here. I hope that it all works out okay for you. Just\nwrite down any concerns you have for us on a\xe2\x80\xa6like a paper airplane,\nand then, like, toss it up to that one low-hanging cloud with a\nladder going up to it, and someone from the Secret Police will come\nto your aid\xe2\x80\xa6just as soon as there are no murderers around and it is\nsafe to do so.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, now wait just one minute\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Spokesperson:\nNo no no no no. There is no need to thank me, Cecil. But\xe2\x80\xa6um\xe2\x80\xa6but\nobviously I would appreciate it. It\xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6always nice to be\nthanked.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, look, I am not going to thank you!\n\n Spokesperson:\nUh\xe2\x80\xa6umm\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you, like, a moment more in case you change your\nmind, like, uh\xe2\x80\xa6like a thank you would be nice.\n\n OK,\nno, I get it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to thank me\xe2\x80\xa6if you\xe2\x80\x99re a jerk.\n\n Cecil:\nOh!\n\n Spokesperson:\nGoodbye.\n\n Cecil:\nSensing that they would not be safe relying on the protection of\nothers, the citizens in the Rec Center were getting nervous. They\nwere shifting, some if them were shifty,\nand one of them was a murderer. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which one, and\nso the citizens began to act in their own protection.\n\n And\nso they each looked back to that same stranger that they had\nsuspected before, each one of them looking back at that same person \xe2\x80\x93\nexcept for those people who, you know, just refused to like, look\naround them, and so now found themselves without a partner. But those\npeople took this\nopportunity to jump on board, and so they found somebody else that\nwas similarly reluctant to participate.\n\n And\nso they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at their partners and you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at your\npartners, look at your partners\xe2\x80\xa6excellent. All right, great. And\nthe two strangers were pointing at each other once again, and in\ntheir deepest, coolest voice they said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen they tried, successfully (or not) to raise one eyebrow, and then\nthey said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re in danger, kid!\xe2\x80\x9d If they were gonna solve\nthis, they would need to work together. They would need to solve this\nas partners, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to trust each other or like each\nother, no way!\n\n And,\nin fact, one of them was already holding up a fist, and the other one\nwas pointing at the ceiling. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know which one of\nthem should do which, because\xe2\x80\xa6the instructions were not very clear\non that point. So one of them began nodding, and the other one began\nshaking their head, but again they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which one should do\nwhich because, you know, the instructions were not altogether there\non that one either. But they just kind of worked it out between the\ntwo of them, like, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna point, and no,\nand\xe2\x80\xa6okay, and you fist and yes? So I\xe2\x80\x99m point\xe2\x80\xa6pointy and fisty.\nPointy fisty. Pointy fisty. Okay, cool. Awesome, awesome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n See\nhow uneasy their working relationship? What a comically odd pairing.\nWhat an unexpected duo! They were a classic trope, these two.\n\n But\nthere was a murder to solve, so they would reluctantly partner up all\nthe same. And so they looked away from each other once again. Watch\nout, murderer! These two are on the case.\n\n Also\non the case are some brave middle schoolers. As is\xe2\x80\xa6as is standard\nthese days when Night Vale is in danger. Yes, a brave group of child\nvigilantes and avid readers. And I have, here in the studio, their\nleader, a courageous 14 year-old, one\xe2\x80\xa6one of the few children to\nface down a librarian during the Summer Reading Program and survive,\nTamika Flynn.\n\n Tamika:\nHello again, Cecil. Hello again, Night Vale. My militia of child\nreaders and I are working on \xe2\x80\x93 to discover who the murderer is. We\nare making inquiries and looking at clues and reading the\nacknowledgments in the backs of books. No one knows why those\nacknowledgments are there, or what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say, so we\xe2\x80\x99re\nleft to assume that they are a complex code for malicious purposes.\n\n Cecil:\nOoh, naturally.\n\n Tamika:\nMy army and I are also wearing capes and donning bulletproof vests\nmade from copies of Thomas Pynchon\xe2\x80\x99s Against\nthe Day, so\xe2\x80\xa6we should be safe from any murderer, and any\nmurderer should be very unsafe from us. We will have this case\nwrapped up soon which is good, because if we had to depend on that\nmurder mystery dinner theater to solve the case, well, that murderer\nwould go on murdering until there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone left to murder and\nthen they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a murderer anymore.\n\n Actually\nthat would solve the problem too, huh? Hmm.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not impressed with the Secret Police\xe2\x80\x99s dinner theater?\n\n Tamika:\nOh, I hate all of that traditional \xe2\x80\x9caudience members looking at\neach other suspiciously and then deciding to solve the case on their\nown\xe2\x80\x9d stuff that we all know from every murder mystery dinner\ntheater that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been to. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nPolice were staging one of those great mystery tales from the masters\nof the craft, full of intrigue and plot twists and long lost twin\nbrothers and fake mustaches\xe2\x80\xa6like The\nFault in Our Stars. Ooh! Or The\nTime Traveler\xe2\x80\x99s Wife.\n\n Cecil:\nAh, yeah.\n\n Tamika:\nOh! Or James Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s\nclassic spy caper Araby.\n\n Cecil:\nYou know I just love the helicopter chase at the end of The Time\nTraveler\xe2\x80\x99s Wife? [Cecil makes helicopter noises as Tamika\nmakes an explosion sound and laughs]\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x93 and that catchphrase that she says right before she\narrests the main bad guy?\n\n Tamika:\nOh! Oh, I know, I know. \xe2\x80\x9cThis one\xe2\x80\x99s for my husband. He\xe2\x80\x99s a time\ntraveler.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nYeah!\n\n Tamika:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s classic.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I love it!\n\n Tamika:\nAnd, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s always The\nPhantom Tollbooth.\n\n Cecil:\nAhhh. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a mystery at all, that is a celebrity memoir.\n\n Tamika:\nYes, but all copies come with a bejeweled dagger between chapters\nseven and eight, so that should come in handy when fighting off a\nmurderer.\n\n In\nany case, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about your dinner theater because if we took\ndown a librarian (and we did), and if we took down a despotic regime\n(and boy, did we), then what chance does one murderer stand against\nthe power of books?\n\n Heavy\nbooks. Heavy, heavy books dropped on their heads.\n\n Cecil:Wow.\n\n Tamika:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna drop so many books on that criminal\xe2\x80\x99s head as soon as I\ncatch them.\n\n Cecil:Yeah.\n\n Tamika:\nDump them right on there. Bam! Bunch of books.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, yeah!\n\n Tamika:\nJust a bunch of teenagers running around crushing evil under the\ncomplete hardback edition of all seven volumes of Marcel\nProust\xe2\x80\x99s monumental novel, Ramona\nQuimby, Age 8.\n\n Cecil:\nTruly the American justice system is the greatest in the world!\n\n Tamika:\nAll right, I must be off. Remember: read, even a little, every day.\nThat way you\xe2\x80\x99ll build up an immunity.\n\n Cecil:\nGreat, thanks so much, Tamik\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Tamika:\nBooks. To be clear, I was talking about books.\n\n Cecil:\nOh.\n\n Tamika:\nRead books.\n\n Cecil:\nYes. Um, ooh! Thank you very much, Tamika!\n\n Oh.\nOh dear. Um, listeners, we are getting word that there has been a\nnearly fatal incident back at the Rec Center, and many suspect that\nthis was no mere accident. The 15-gallon tub full of old socket\nwrenches that was balanced precariously atop a few 2x6 planks of wood\nnext to the Rec Center basketball courts fell over, nearly crushing\nthe pair of strangers who recently came begrudgingly together to help\nsolve a terrible murder.\n\n The\ntwo strangers had been getting in each others\xe2\x80\x99 way, challenging each\nothers\xe2\x80\x99 authority, thinking things like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re getting\xe2\x80\x99 in my\nway, buddy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNuh-uh, you are,\xe2\x80\x9d and expressing their hurt\nfeelings using only the shapes of their mouths, worried that at any\nmoment, in fact in just a few\nmoments, they might have to look each other in the eye and say words\nout loud again.\n\n And\nall along, right above them, the tub full of wrenches teetered.\n\n Okay,\nlook. Eye contact can be uncomfortable, sure, but it is way less\nuncomfortable than the weight of heavy metal objects falling upon\nthin human skulls. And the tub full of wrenches teetered, and the\nnarrow planks beneath it groaned, groaned, and then gave, and then\nsnap! And the two strangers looked back to each other once again, and\nthey both simultaneously shouted the word, \xe2\x80\x9cDuck!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthey were right! A duck flew in through an open window and knocked\nthat tub full of socket wrenches harmlessly out of the way. And the\ntwo strangers looked at each other, and\xe2\x80\xa6and smiled, and they both\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have duck telepathy too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen they laughed, together. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! And it was a long\nhealthy true laugh. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! It was a completely\nnatural unforced\nlaugh. Ah-ha-ha-ha-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n And\nthen they turned away from each other, back to the job of solving\ncrimes. But each one of them thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to have a\nbegrudging respect for your skills, kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Sadly,\nthat tub full of socket wrenches had been teetering 12 feet off the\nground on those thin pine boards since the Rec Center was built five\nyears ago, so\xe2\x80\xa6woo! It is a real shame to lose such an important\narchitectural feature of such a historic building.\n\n Now,\nin response to this dire circumstance, Mayor Dana Cardinal has sent\nher official Night Vale Director of Emergency Press Conferences to\nissue an emergency press conference. So please welcome former mayor\nPamela Winchell.\n\n Pamela:\nHello, people of Night Vale! Hello, non-people of Night Vale! The\nnonexistent ones among us \xe2\x80\x93 you know you you aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 hello to\nthe non-physical entities who drift among our bodies and our\nthoughts.\n\n Well,\nhow 'bout that? I try to be nice to the unseen nonexistent beings,\nand this is the response I get!\n\n Cecil:\nWhat response did you get?\n\n Pamela:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\n\n Cecil:\nOhh.\n\n Pamela: That\xe2\x80\x93\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the problem with the unseen ones, they\xe2\x80\x99re also unheard and\nunfelt. You know, I am thinking of having them arrested. Which,\nconsidering that they don\xe2\x80\x99t exist, is the same thing as actually\narresting them.\n\n Uh,\nbut, but\xe2\x80\xa6there is a much greater danger to our town.\n\n Cecil:\nRight, the murderer.\n\n Pamela:\nThe mayor asked me to issue the following statement:\n\n Inside\nevery newborn child lives a tiny insect, which controls the child\xe2\x80\x99s\nmovements. The insect only understands physical needs and basic\ndesires. That insect sits in its little chair pulling levers and\nmaking the child grab and sleep and cry and eat. But one night, the\ninsect leaves its chair from inside the child, and it crawls out of\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and slithers away into the forest where it curls up\ninto a cocoon. Before it does this it whispers to the child, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare alone now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Years\nlater the cocoon hatches, and the insect emerges unchanged, and does\nnot miss the child at all. And that child, like all children, grows\nup to be the president of the United States.\n\n Cecil:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s statement on the murderer?\n\n Pamela:\nThe mayor didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about murderers. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually\nwrite that statement. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know I\xe2\x80\x99m here! [Laughs]\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s off at that dinner theater thing.\n\n Cecil:\nNow\xe2\x80\xa6the murder mystery dinner theater, which is to, you know, stop\nthe murderer?\n\n Pamela:\nGreat! So what do you need the mayor for? Who cares if my story is\nunrelated to murderers? I\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I was reminded of it\nsuddenly. What am I, some sort of expert on memory?\n\n I\nam. World-renowned.\n\n The\npoint is, some people are worried about murderers. Others are worried\nabout other things. We all have our personal challenges. For\ninstance, I just found out that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see cars.\n\n Cecil:\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t see cars?\n\n Pamela:\nNo! No! Apparently I have never been able to. My ornithologist keeps\ntrying different prescription lenses, but\xe2\x80\xa6every time I go near a\nhighway, I just see people with their legs and arms outstretched in\nfront of them zooming inches off the asphalt. I have always wondered\nwhy other people didn\xe2\x80\x99t find highways as hilarious and upsetting as I\ndo.\n\n Cecil:\nDid you mean optometrist? Because you said ornithologist.\n\n Pamela:\nI am 1/16th peregrine falcon on my father\xe2\x80\x99s side! Cecil, what I came\nto speak to you about today is the real danger to Night Vale:\nindifference.\n\n Cecil:\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound at all like what you came here to speak about.\n\n Pamela:\nI call upon the citizens of Night Vale to take pride in their civic\nduties. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let feelings of insignificance or ennui or excitement\nwhen a dog jumps up on your legs distract you from your\nresponsibility to vote, to keep streets clean, to deny the existence\nof angels, and to make holiday cookies for\xe2\x80\x93 for agents from a\nVague, Yet Menacing Government Agency who sit outside your home,\nnight after night, in stuffy black sedans, monitoring your dull\nconversations and lives.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, but what about the murders going on right now? It is not civic\nindifference to be terrified of dying!\n\n Pamela:\nAgree to disagree. But listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking to anyone currently\nkilling someone: You alone are permitted to be totally indifferent.\nCare less\xe2\x80\xa6especially about killing people. Uh, maybe care more\nabout after school programs. So, in conclusion, care about everything\nin your town, except killing people.\n\n Cecil:\nThank you very much, Pamela.\n\n Pamela:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s Pamela! Just one\nM! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use this water slide to go back to City Hall now.\nWhee!\n\n Cecil:\nAnd now an update on last week\xe2\x80\x99s power outages. The Night Vale\nElectric Utility announced today that there may be more power outages\nin coming weeks. This time, due to sadness.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve\njust been sad this week,\xe2\x80\x9d the Electric Utility said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for any\nreason, just\xe2\x80\xa6sometimes we get sad. What do we need a reason for?\nLast week we were feeling vengeful, so\xe2\x80\xa6power outages. This week\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re feeling sad, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue expressing ourselves\nthrough the medium of power outages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Now,\npower outages were, of course, certified by the Supreme Court as a\nprotected form of free speech in the 1973 case of the Hayworth\nElectric Company vs the Hayworth Hospital. And the court stated that\nreasonable causes for a power outage include celebration of a special\nsomeone\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, expression of undirected anger at an intransigent\npolitical system, and periods of just feeling sad for no reason.\n\n But\nthe Night Vale Electric Utility would like me to remind you that\npower outages are no excuse not to pay your electric bill. I mean,\nelectricity is, after all, a privilege, not a right. Failure to pay\nyour electric bill may result in localized lightning storms, shrouded\nfigures standing silently in the back of familiar TV shows, and gout.\nSo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n The\nmurder mystery dinner theater is still in full swing but frankly,\ngive or take a falling tub of socket wrenches, there seems not to be\nmuch of a murder mystery left to solve. I mean, the murderer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmurdered anybody in quite a while.\n\n Okay,\nokay, sure, a bunch of murders did happen today. But that was, like,\nseveral minutes ago! Maybe even a whole hour, and it just feels like,\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, why go digging through old dirt?\n\n Plus,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure that we could charge anybody with those crimes. I\nmean, the statue of limitations? You know, that statue of our own\nlimitations that we all carved last year? Just feels like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow, we might be done here. Sorry to disappoint anybody that was\nlooking for the whole \xe2\x80\x9cmystery\xe2\x80\x9d side of things to be res\xe2\x80\x93\n\n [Cecil\nbreathing heavily]\n\n Sorry,\nlisteners. I just\xe2\x80\xa6I thought I heard something. I mean, something\noutside of the sound of my own voice and\xe2\x80\x93 and\xe2\x80\x93 and that small\nnest of owls that\xe2\x80\x99s kept in the corner of every radio studio. But\nthere shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anybody here! Everyone has to be at the Rec\nCenter. It\xe2\x80\x99s the law, and nobody\nbreaks the law! Nobody except\xe2\x80\xa6[gasps]\nlaw breakers!\n\n Listeners,\nI think the murderer may have taken advantage of the fact that all\ncitizens are at the Rec Center and they\xe2\x80\x99ve crept over here to the\nradio studio where I\xe2\x80\x99m all by myself.\n\n [Gasps]\n\n I\nsee movement in the dim of the control booth.\n\n Hello? Are\nyou here to feed the owls?\n\n No\nanswer.\n\n Carlos?\nCarlos, is that you?\n\n Nothing.\nJust the sound of my own breath, in and out. Even as you are all\nhearing my voice right now, I am alone. Or worse yet, I am not\nalone.\n\n [Gasps]\n\n A\nfootstep behind me. And another. And another. The sound of someone\nwalking toward me. The murderer is here at the radio studio. A shadow\nreaches across my desk. The murderer is here for me, and I am\nnarrating my own demise!\n\n Listeners,\nthere is only one thing left to do, but I must act quickly! I must\ntake all of you\xe2\x80\xa6to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cMaker\nof My Sorrow\xe2\x80\x9d by Eliza\nRickman]\n\n Hello,\nNight Vale! Ahh! It is a relief to say those words aloud, alive, and\nto you once again.\n\n Just\nafter introducing the weather, I felt movement and I heard footsteps,\nand I saw my life flash before my eyes and its imminent ending made\nthem water.\n\n And\nthen, the murderer attacked, and I\xe2\x80\x93 and I could\xe2\x80\x93 I tried to\nscream, but I could manage only faint gargles to no one. Well,\nexcept, you know, one person, but it was like the person least\nlikely to provide me aid.\n\n Fortunately,\nI had a copy of Lois Lowry\xe2\x80\x99s novel The\nGiver, which Tamika had loaned to me recently, and it was the\nlimited edition that comes without cover or pages or words, and is\nmade entirely out of wood and metal and is in the shape of a hammer.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nactually just a hammer. Tamika loaned me a hammer.\n\n Anyway,\nunfortunately, uh, the hammer was just out of my reach so I stretched\nout my hand, reaching, struggling, grasping for that classic of\ncontemporary children\xe2\x80\x99s literature so I could crack the head of my\nattacker.\n\n And\nthat is when I heard a noise. And, listeners, I thought it was my\ndeath rattle. Or my death chime. Or even rarer still, my death\ntrombone. But it was a shout. It was two\nshouts. Two people.\n\n And\nthen I felt warmth, and I felt air gasp into my chest, and\xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x93\n I felt the hands upon me loosen, and I saw the two people who saved\nme, and then they brought me here, now, to the Rec Center, here, with\nall of you!\n\n Well,\nnot just all of you,\nbut specifically\xe2\x80\xa6you.\nThe murderer.\n\n Stand\nup, please.\n\n And\nall the citizens of Night Vale pointed at the murderer and gasped!\n\n [Gasp]\n\n And\nthey all shook their heads, not in anger, just in disbelief!\n\n And\nI asked the murderer, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthe murderer answered. But I just talked right over them because\nanything they had to say was moot in light of their heinous crimes!\n\n Now,\nwe all know that the murderer must be punished in the way that every\nmurderer is punished here in Night Vale.\n\n And\nthe punishment is coming! Here it comes! Ah, the punishment is so\nsevere I can\xe2\x80\x99t even look!\n\n The\ncrowd all said to the murderer, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease do not ever murder again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthe murderer shrugged their shoulders and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSure!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Yeah,\nand they applauded this former criminal for reforming their evil\nways. And all the citizens of Night Vale just let that tension relax\nfrom their shoulders, happy to know that this person will\ndefinitely\xe2\x80\xa6probably\nnever murder again.\n\n Now,\nof course, I have not forgotten about the two strangers, the two\nheroes, that odd couple, that unlikely duo, those two that saved my\nlife back at the radio station. While all of Night Vale sat huddled\nhere in the Rec Center dreading murderers and actors and [gasp]\nlive theater!?, these two put their seemingly incompatible minds to\nwork, and one of them noticed that the murders had stopped, and\nrealized that the murderer must have left to find other people to\nmurder, but\xe2\x80\xa6who was left in town to murder?\n\n And\nthe other one realized, it must be Cecil. For Cecil was by himself at\nthe radio station. He alone was alone. And so, without having to\nexchange a word, with only a knowing glance, these two rushed to the\nradio station and saved my life.\n\n And\nthe danger was over, and\xe2\x80\x93 and the case was solved, and no one else\nwould die this day. Or, if they did, it would be because their body\njust simply stopped, just like had an error and then they toppled\nright over. But not because of anything as mundane as murder.\n\n And\nso the two strangers looked back to each other one last time,\nunwavering in their eye contact. They had been through so much, and\nthey had seen each other through all of it. What luck they had in\npicking a counterpart so competent and so trustworthy, and so\ncompletely not a murderer!\n\n So\nthey wink at each other. *Wink!*\n\n Yeah,\nbut, like, big winks. *WIIIINK!*\n\n Or\nmaybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You know, maybe for just one moment,\nthey just simply looked at each other with whatever faces, with\nwhatever feelings and emotions, with whatever moment that is this\nmoment, just their honest selves, for better or worse.\n\n And\nthen they give each other a smile, and a thumbs up! Yeah! Like, a big\nsmile! With a lot of teeth! Like, an unnatural amount of teeth!\n\n And\nthen they looked back at the stage, still smiling because these two,\nyou two had done it! These ex-strangers, these friends, these great,\nthese true, these investigators. You.\n\n As\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s famous detective character, Veronica Mars, once said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the world\xe2\x80\x99s a stage, and all the men and women are frightened\npeople blackmailed into acting upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthe evening turns to night. And soon, all of the citizens of Night\nVale will disperse back to their homes, and their hovels, and their\nhideaways, and their witching caves.\n\n But\nfor this one evening, we all came together. And what are human beings\nbut a coming together? What are we for, except to lean into those\naround us, to balance against those around us. A\xe2\x80\x93 a\xe2\x80\x93 a delicate,\nbut provocative sculpture.\n\n The\nNight Vale murder mystery diner theater is over, sure, but what\nhappened within it will have always happened. We lived\ntogether this night! And we always will have.\n\n Look\xe2\x80\xa6harm\ncan come from anywhere, or anyone. Whether it is a stranger, or a\nfriend, or one of those traffic intersections that has poisonous\nsnakes instead of traffic lights\xe2\x80\xa6but still, we reach out the hand.\nStill, we allow our eyes to meet. Still, we hope for the best, and we\ntry to be the best in return because if not, then what else? If\nnot\xe2\x80\xa6then nothing.\n\n A\nhuman life\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a moment of eye contact in a crowd.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for tomorrow. By any means necessary.\n\n Goodnight\nto all of you listeners here.\n\n And\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n [I would like\nto send a special thank you to cecilbaldwin-fan\nfor transcribing these bonus tracks. I went through them before\nposting, though, so any errors are 100% my fault, not theirs. All\ncredit for wonderfulness goes to them, any blame for mistakes goes to\nme. The buck stops here, as they say.]\n\n BONUS TRACK \xe2\x80\x93 Michelle Nguyen\n\n Cecil:\nMichelle Nguyen has dropped by the radio station, and she says that\nshe has a really big\nannouncement. And like, could I just stop talking for a moment,\nbecause she\xe2\x80\x99s really trying to share an authentic part of herself,\nlike really, you know, connect, or whatever? And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand, it\xe2\x80\x99s not important! Anyway, for more on that, please\nwelcome Michelle Nguyen!\n\n Michelle\nNguyen: Hi, Cecil! Wait, am I on the\nradio? \n\n\n Cecil: Yes!\nThus the big Night Vale Community Radio sign outside, and the radio\nequipment in here, and the fact that I constantly whisper \xe2\x80\x9cradio\nradio radio radio\xe2\x80\x9d whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m not on the microphone.\n\n Michelle:\nUgh. I don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the radio anymore. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m all about\npodcasts. They\xe2\x80\x99re like radio, but you know, the future? \n\n\n Cecil: I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve in the future.\n\n Michelle:\nNeither do I. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, that\xe2\x80\x99s totally not the point. The\npoint is that I\xe2\x80\x99m here to announce Dark Owl Fest, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst ever independent electro-witch-hop music festival.\n\n Cecil: \nOoh!\n\n Michelle: Now\nnone of us have to travel to those big corporate witch-hop festivals\nlike Coachella or Croneroo. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have the absolute best in this\nobscure form of music that only I truly appreciate, right here in\ntown!\n\n Cecil: That\nsounds like fun, when is it? \n\n\n Michelle: Today,\nright now. I rented out all of Mission Grove Park. It cost me six\nmonths of Dark Owl Records\xe2\x80\x99 income to organize this, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m\nhere. I had been planning on being the only person at the festival\nbecause\xe2\x80\xa6you know how I feel about things that are popular.\n\n Cecil:\nYou\xe2\x80\xa6hate them?\n\n Michelle: No!\nUgh, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s hating popular things these days! Anyway, it turns\nout that I am in huge financial trouble if I don\xe2\x80\x99t sell a\nbunch of tickets to this thing. So now I need everyone to head on\ndown to Mission Grove Park to buy tickets. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much\ntickets are, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting to have to sell any. But if\neveryone could just bring wads of cash to Mission Grove Park, and\ngive them to me please. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fun day. Bring your kids! Tell\nyour kids to bring cash too! \n\n\n Cecil: Michelle,\nthis sounds like kind of a dangerous day to be doing this.\n\n Michelle: Oh, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n Cecil: You\ndisagree?\n\n Michelle: No, I\njust don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Sounds like you do though.\n\n Cecil: Michelle,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know about the murderer?\n\n Michelle:\nPlease, Cecil. I knew about The Murderer before anyone else. I have\nall of their albums, even the five unreleased ones and the hundreds\nof unrecorded ones.\n\n Cecil: No, I mean\nthe dangerous criminal in our midst!\n\n Michelle: Oh! If\nyou meant the Dangerous Criminal, then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just say so?\nTheir take on pop punk rhymecore is so fresh! Wait, unless you like\nthem. Other people aren\xe2\x80\x99t starting to like them, are they? Oh no,\nwhy did I use the word \xe2\x80\x9cfresh\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\n Cecil: Michelle,\nthere is a killer-\n\n Michelle: The\nKillers! Those sellouts? Like I get it, anyone can write an 18-minute\nlong experimental jazz song with a throat singing solo and get a\nradio hit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple formula. Wake me up when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to\nmake some art. \n\n\n Cecil: I give up.\n\n Michelle:\nI gave up a long time ago. Wait, what are you talking about? \n\n\n Cecil: Michelle,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous murderer in town, people are being killed! I\nmean, the Secret Police has ordered everyone to the Rec Center! It\nwould be dangerous to go to a music festival today. And also illegal.\nWell, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s illegal to go a music festival any day, but today\nit\xe2\x80\x99s like, extra illegal.\n\n Michelle: Cecil,\nI think I might be broke. Even with the kind of serious money you\nmake from a record store these days\xe2\x80\xa6why did I think I could afford\nto put on a huge music festival only for me? What if I lose the\nstore? Dark Owl Records is everything to me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t lose it. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. I won\xe2\x80\x99t. [Sighs, long beat] \n\n\n Cecil: Michelle?\nAre you OK?\n\n Michelle:\nOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing just great. I just put on a music festival that is so\nfar out of the mainstream, no one\nwill have seen it. Plus having money is so 2014. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a sellout,\nyou know? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start an underground trade and barter\nsociety based around leather work and old Morrissey records. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nnever been happier.\n\n Cecil: OK! Well,\nyou should probably stroll on down to the Rec Center before you get\narrested for not being there.\n\n Michelle: OK. Bye\nCecil. I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t get like, murdered, or whatever.\n\n Cecil: All right.\nThank you so much, Michelle! \n\n\n BONUS TRACK \xe2\x80\x93 Earl\nHarlan\n\n Cecil:\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a look now at the Community Calendar.\n\n Wednesday\nevening, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s most popular restaurant, Tourniquet, will be\nhosting a special chef\xe2\x80\x99s table dinner. To learn more about this, we\nhave Tourniquet\xe2\x80\x99s sous-chef, Earl Harlan, right now on the phone\nwith us. Thanks for joining us, Earl!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Thank you, Cecil! Well, the\nannual chef\xe2\x80\x99s table dinner is a special night, when our executive\nchef, LaShawn Mason, personally curates and prepares a five-course\ntasting menu. It\xe2\x80\x99s 500 dollars prix fixe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s limited to\nonly 13 attendees, so it will be an intimate and a unique experience.\n\n Chef\nMason wants to share some brand new dishes he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on in\nhis test kitchen. He hand-delivers each dish to the diners.\n[creepily]\nAnd then\xe2\x80\xa6 he lingers\xe2\x80\xa6slowly over each diner, as they eat.\nExplaining every single bite, as he touches their chins\xe2\x80\xa6gently with\nhis rough thumbs\xe2\x80\xa6and his soft\xe2\x80\xa6moist palms\xe2\x80\xa6lifting their\nmandibles up and down\xe2\x80\xa6to help them through the first stage\xe2\x80\xa6of the\nhuman digestive process. He also matches his heartbeat with theirs.\nEveryone\xe2\x80\xa6at the chef\xe2\x80\x99s table\xe2\x80\xa6will share a heartbeat.\n\n Cecil:\nThat sounds very posh! \n\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Have you ever listened to a heartbeat, Cecil?\n\n Cecil:\nOh sure. Yeah, I can actually hear my own right now, very loudly in\nmy headphones, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Po-pom, po-pom,\npo-pom-pom-pom-pom-po\xe2\x80\xa6Pom pom pom pom pom pom pom pom pom\npopopopopopom,\npommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\n\n\n Earl\nHarlan: That sounds terrifying.\n\n Cecil:\nIt is!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Anyway, this year\xe2\x80\x99s dinner\nwill center around quail. \n\n\n Cecil:\nOoh!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Chef Mason recently\nrediscovered the joy of quail meat, while on a spiritual retreat\nunderneath his own bed. He was there for weeks, curled into a fetal\nposition, alternating between screaming and crying, and clenching his\neyes and teeth tightly, because he is really\ninto meditation these days.\n\n During\nthe retreat, he found several quail living in his box spring\nmattress. And they were his only friends. He named them Ann, George,\nLatimer, Kaska, and Junior, and Friday. They all kept each other\ncompany in the cold dark night. And later when Chef Mason got hungry,\nhe ate them all. It was hard to lose such good friends. But they were\nso delicious, he wanted to share that flavor with Night Vale.\n\n Cecil:\nSo, will you be at the dinner, Earl?\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Oh yes! Yes, I will wake up\nthat morning, and I will stare at myself in the mirror repeating,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do this, Earl. You can\ndo this, Earl. You can do\nthis, Earl.\xe2\x80\x9d Until my reflection says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll brush each others\xe2\x80\x99 teeth, and trim each others\xe2\x80\x99\nmustaches, and comb each others\xe2\x80\x99 hair\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nAwwww!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: \xe2\x80\xa6and then step through the mirror and once again switch\nplaces in each others\xe2\x80\x99 mirrored world for the day.\n\n Cecil:\nAh!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive my car slowly into the parking lot of\nTourniquet, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll call my son to tell him I love him. And\nthat I remembered his name, which I can do most days.\n\n Cecil:\nOh!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll sigh heavily,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my tuque and my jacket, and do my job. \n\n\n Cecil:\nWell, it is such a blessing to have a career that you love! So, what\ncan the diners expect at this rare culinary event? \n\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Well, we will start with quail salad with a fig and\norange milk dressing.\n\n Cecil:\nMm!\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Followed by a large amount of quail eggs dropped from the\nceiling. Then pasta made entirely from beaks. \n\n\n Cecil:\nHuh.\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Then the main course, in which I\xe2\x80\x99ll use a bullhorn to\nrecite instructions for gutting and cleaning, while each diner is\ngiven a live quail and a brick.\n\n Cecil:\nOhhh! Mmmm! Oh, It says \xe2\x80\x93 your press release says that dinner\nbegins at 7:30. \n\n\n Earl\nHarlan: 7:30 PM on the dot! Now this is one of the coolest parts\nof the whole night. It\xe2\x80\x99s right at 7:30, when all of the diners from\nlast year\xe2\x80\x99s event will finally be released from the kitchen\xe2\x80\xa6and\nsent back to their old lives. \n\n\n Cecil:\nAwww. Well that sounds fun. \n\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Oh the sounds. There\xe2\x80\xa6are\nso\xe2\x80\xa6many\xe2\x80\xa6sounds, Cecil. There are so\nmany things to hear\xe2\x80\xa6and to deal with. \n\n\n Cecil:\n[very long beat]\n\xe2\x80\xa6Yes there are a lot of sounds, Earl. Um, thankfully my job is to\ntalk and not to listen. Um, it is great to have you on the show,\nEarl. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this again soon, OK?\n\n Earl\nHarlan: Bye bye Cecil, talk to you soon.\n\n Cecil:\nAlright, bye Earl.\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: John Peters\n\n Cecil:\nWe are getting word that there may have been an eye witness to the\nmurder. Which is one of the top three witnesses, behind foot witness\nand kidney witness. And we have the witness on the phone with us\nright now. It is John Peters (you know, the farmer)! \n\n\n John\nPeters: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. \n\n\n Cecil:\nNow John-\n\n JP:\nOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s me! \n\n\n Cecil:\nNow you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that you saw the murder take place. \n\n\n JP:\nAbsolutely!\n\n Cecil:\nWell tell us about it, what did you see? \n\n\n JP:\nWell I was out my field this mornin\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m- I\xe2\x80\x99m a farmer, you\nknow. \n\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I did not know that!\n\n JP:\nReally I feel like most people-\n\n Cecil:\nYes, John, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re a farmer. \n\n\n JP:\nOh, ahaha! Ha, well I was out my field this mornin\xe2\x80\x99, right, growin\xe2\x80\x99\nmy imaginary corn, and I saw some movement on the edge of my vision.\nRight in that point where seein\xe2\x80\x99 becomes not seein\xe2\x80\x99. And I\nturned, and I saw\xe2\x80\xa6a great silver craft, disk-shaped with portholes\nat regular intervals!\n\n Cecil:\nNow wait a second\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n JP:\nOh, there were bein\xe2\x80\x99s inside, of astonishing structure, and they\nwere lookin\xe2\x80\x99 out of the windows at me. I felt the hairs on the back\nof my neck\xe2\x80\xa6with my hand, cause I\xe2\x80\x99d put my hand on the back of my\nneck in surprise. Those hairs are so soft back there, you ever\xe2\x80\xa6you\never just think about the hairs on the back of your neck, Cecil?\n\n Cecil:\n[creepy voice]\nYes, constantly. [normal voice]\nBut what does this have to do with the murderer and\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\n JP:\nOh right right right right, well the craft landed and the bein\xe2\x80\x99s\ncame out. They were of astonishing structure, and one of them, their\nleader, said \xe2\x80\x9cBehold. My name is Klangor. We have arrived on your\nEarth from some place distant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nJohn\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n JP:\nMm? \n\n\n Cecil:\nDid you or did you not see a murder? \n\n\n JP:\nThese beings, they were of\xe2\x80\xa6astonishing structure. They took me into\ntheir craft, and they showed me times and places far and along from\nthis here and ago. Did you know, Cecil, that the universe is not in\nfact a single ever-expanding four-dimensional sphere of life and\nmatter? No, no Cecil! The universe, I have learned, is merely a\nparticle composed entirely of itself, and comprisin\xe2\x80\x99 a greater\nversion of itself. A recursive function of its own body, repeated\nlike identical cells formed in the shape of that which each cell\nphysically expresses. You know I think of Benoit Mandelbrot\xe2\x80\x99s\nfamous set of equations. Each iteration a repeated pattern,\npsychedelic and vast. Our universe is not made of matter, nor time\nnor space, Cecil. Our universe\xe2\x80\xa6is made of possibilities. \n\n\n Cecil:\nSo you saw\xe2\x80\xa6nothing\nuseful or interesting at all?\n\n JP:\nOh, oh! Oh, oh, yes. Then these beings placed me, childlike, back\ndown upon my Earth, and their craft sprang up into the air, leaving a\nstrange imaginary shape in my imaginary corn field. I held my hand up\nin farewell\xe2\x80\xa6through the windows, I could see them hold\nup\xe2\x80\xa6whatever it was they had at the end of their limbs. They were of\nastonishing structure! And then\xe2\x80\xa6they were gone. I do not believe I\nwill ever be the same again. I do not believe I\xe2\x80\x99m the same now.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, John. I should have known that you were a farmer, not a witness!\nThis is why witnessing should be left to the professionals. Paid\nwitnesses, who will witness whatever crime you want for a nominal\nfee. This is how witnessing should be done, not by \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry \xe2\x80\x93\namateur citizens who might see incorrect things or repeat forbidden\ntruths.\n\n JP:\nOh. I- I just really wanted to tell that story. I- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be of any help with the murder. Ever since this mornin\xe2\x80\x99\nI- I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been too busy weepin\xe2\x80\x99 in awe and transcendent grief\nto witness anything at all! \n\n\n Cecil:\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s OK, John. But please, next time only call if you have\nsomething interesting you want to tell us. Goodbye, John.\n\n JP:\nGoodbye, thank you Cecil!\n\n Cecil:\nMm hmm, absolutely. \n\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Melony Pennington\n\n Cecil:\nComputers. They seem difficult to use, right? Well, they are\nvery difficult. And heavily regulated. And also, deadly. I mean, I\npersonally don\xe2\x80\x99t like that computers are just, people are just\nallowed to have computers, you know without a prerequisite waiting\nperiod. But for those times in which you inevitably give in to the\nweakness of the human condition, we here at Night Vale Community\nRadio are pleased to present\xe2\x80\xa6Computer Tips! With local computer\nexpert and programmer, Melony Pennington!\n\n Welcome\nto my show, Melony! \n\n\n Melony:\nWelcome to your show! Oh, I mean hi, hello. It turns out you welcomed\nme, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to welcome you. Sorry, my mind was, you\nknow, the expanse. The vast. The out there. I mean my mind was\nelsewhere. My mind was everywhere.\n\n Cecil:\nWonderful! And how are you\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Melony:\nDo you ever look at the stars? The stars. You know, the stars. Not\neach star, but some of the stars. I mean every single one of the\nstars at once. I mean the whole night sky added up. Do you ever look\nat the sum of the stars? The night sky, as an equation? Beauty as a\nmath problem? Which it is \xe2\x80\x93 everything beautiful is math.\nEverything beautiful is a problem.\n\n What\nwas your question?\n\n Cecil:\nUmm, how are you doing?\n\n Melony:\nOh. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\n\n Cecil:\nNow\xe2\x80\xa6Melony, you sound familiar.\n\n Melony:\nDo I sound familiar? You just said that, so I guess I do. You must\nhave met one of my programs\xe2\x80\xa6or not met,\nnone of them are sentient. You can\xe2\x80\x99t meet things that have no\nsentience. Well, I guess you could be like, \xe2\x80\x9cHi there, pile of\nrocks, I\xe2\x80\x99m Melony,\xe2\x80\x9d just to see what happens. I guess there is no\nset dogma for social engagement.\n\n God,\nI wish I had a dog.\n\n Have\nyou ever met a rock?\n\n Also,\nwhat was your name again?\n\n Cecil:\nWell I'm\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Melony:\nWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I probably sound familiar because all of my\nprograms have the same voice as me. That\xe2\x80\x99s how computer programming\nworks.\n\n Cecil:\nHave you ever programmed a computer that broadcasts on a radio\nstation, specifically one that recites random numbers?\n\n Melony:\nOh! Oh, yes! WZZZ! Yes, that was one of my early programs. And those\nnumbers and chimes aren\xe2\x80\x99t random; they\xe2\x80\x99re encoded messages to\nforeign spies. Also a few pudding recipes and a funny cryptology poem\nor two.\n\n Cecil:\nSo you made Fey, the voice of WZZZ!\n\n Melony:\nOh, the WZZZ program had no name, and absolutely no sentience. Not\nevery program is sentient. That WZZZ program only recites numbers and\ntones. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it does, and all it ever will do.\n\n Cecil:\nBut-\n\n Melony:\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it exists.\n\n Cecil:\nBut I-\n\n Melony:\nOh, just listen to me babbling on! [chuckles]\nYou had me on to talk computer tips, so let\xe2\x80\x99s give your listeners\nsome computer tips. Ahem.\n\n Tip\n1: Computers can make you angry. Anything can make you angry.\nComputers are anything. Tip 2: Is your computer plugged in? That\xe2\x80\x99s\nillegal. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal to plug in your computer. Tip 3, people:\nComputer programs are a lot like humans. They\xe2\x80\x99re full of bugs.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re mostly theoretical, and invented by overly caffeinated\nlonely people in dark rooms. [chuckles] Tip\n4: Did I say that thing about the\nstars already?\n\n Cecil:\nYes.\n\n Melony:\nOh, good.\n\n Tip\n5: The most secure password possible is (you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess this!):\nwhere the O is replaced with a zero, and the Ls are replaced with\nzeros, and all of the other letters are replaced with zeros. A string\nof 19 zeros is the most secure password.\n\n Cecil:\nYou know, sometimes I like to add an exclamation point at the end.\n\n Melony:\nOh, exclamation points are impossible to hack! You are very secure.\n\n Tip\n6: There are two main types of computers. The first are PCs, or\npersonal computers. Personal computers know your name, and things\nabout your life, and are casual and friendly. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re\noverly personal and you end up having to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s just\ntoo much! Back off, computer.\xe2\x80\x9d The second type of computer is the\nhouse cat. These are ambulant robotic quadrupeds used by the Secret\nPolice to monitor our domestic behavior and try to understand why\npeople like to stroke robots and talk in high voices to them.\n\n Cecil:\nThis has been so very helpful!\n\n Melony:\nAh! Thank you for saying that! I love to be helpful! Sometimes I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel so helpful. Sometimes I feel kind of useless and it gets\nme down.\n\n Cecil:\nAww. Well, I know that feeling. And hey, sometimes when I\xe2\x80\x99m sad, I\nlike to sing old hymns to myself.\n\n Melony:\nMe too! Which one\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite?\n\n Cecil:\n\xe2\x99\xab I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter \xe2\x99\xab\n\n Cecil\nand Melony singing together: \xe2\x99\xaa\nDancin\xe2\x80\x99 through the fire, 'cause I am a champion, and you\xe2\x80\x99re\ngonna hear me roar! \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n Melony:\nThat is my favorite passage from the Old Testament! Oh, I feel better\nalready.\n\n Cecil:\nAwww, thanks, Melony!\n\n Melony:\nOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch your name. Bye!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, OK!\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Louie Blasko\n\n Cecil:\nOoh! Listeners! I have a really big surprise for you. We have the\nreturn of our popular segment, Louie Blasko\xe2\x80\x99s Music Moment. Now we\nso rarely get this treat, as Louie long ago skipped town after he\nburned down his insurance \xe2\x80\x93 he burned down his music shop for the\ninsurance money. And ever since then he has been singing catchy songs\nand dwelling in the dreamscape of our children\xe2\x80\x99s nightmares. And\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Louie joining us via the phone. Welcome to our show,\nLouie! Um, where are you calling from? What exciting location are you\nhiding out in these days? \n\n\n Louie:\n[chuckles] Thank you for having me. \n\n\n Cecil:\nNow what sort of musical lesson do you have for us today? \n\n\n Louie:\nOh, well, today, I wanted to talk about the importance of warming up\nyour vocal chords. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you all some\xe2\x80\x93 some simple\nvocal warm-ups that you can use whenever you\xe2\x80\xa6First. Make a really\nsad face at the sky. [long beat] Then sing a little scale,\nlike this: [screams] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! \n\n\n Cecil:\nYou know, I do that exact same warm-up before every show. I just\npretend that everything in my life has been taken from me, it really\nhelps get me in the mood. \n\n\n Louie:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good approach, because everything we have either has\nalready been taken from us, or eventually will be.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd thinking about that really loosens up my vocal chords, and also I\nstart crying.\n\n Louie:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s good! Crying is your body\xe2\x80\x99s way of telling you it\xe2\x80\x99s\nready to make art. \n\n\n Cecil:\nMmm.\n\n Louie:\nNow, another really good vocal warm-up is the tongue twister. \n\n\n Cecil:\nOh, I know so many of those! Um, like \xe2\x80\x9cred leather human leather\nred leather human leather red leather human leather,\xe2\x80\x9d or the old\nstandard \xe2\x80\x9cshe knells death bells deep beneath the sea floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Louie:\nThose are certainly classics. But you know, here\xe2\x80\x99s a little tongue\ntwister I often use. Ahem. [choking noises] Cut! Cut! Cut\nthem! Cut them! Cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut them! Cut cut carve\ncarve carve faces over their faces, cut! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\ndo it! Officer\xe2\x80\x93 Haha! No no, cut cu- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t! \n\n\n Cecil:\nThat is a really good tongue twister! Catchy and fun and also kinda\ntricky.\n\n Now\nLouie, what about when we\xe2\x80\x99re not singing? I mean, do we still need\nto do a vocal warm-up? I\xe2\x80\x99m only asking because I was thinking about\ntaking up a musical instrument. Now, um, Carlos has been telling me\nthat I should get the ukulele, because it\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, easy to\nlearn, and he says that I\xe2\x80\x99d look really cute while playing it. But\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about installing a pipe organ in our apartment,\nand playing that instead.\n\n Louie:\nSure, you know there are warm-ups that you can, that will work on any\ninstrument. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna show you some basic arpeggio scales,\nfor your ukulele or pipe organ or\xe2\x80\xa6 [long beat]\n\n [chaotic\noff-key scales] \n\n\n Cecil:\nMm, hmm mm. Sounds like that warm up is really gonna get the blood\nflowing!\n\n Louie:\nSo much blood. There is so much blood, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, thank you for teaching us those warm-ups, Louie. I hope that\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll return.\n\n Louie:\nOh, I will return. I will return when you least expect it. \n\n\n Cecil:\nHow about we do the second Tuesday in November at 1 PM?\n\n Louie:\nPerfect.\n\n Cecil:\nExcellent! Thank you so much, Louie!\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Hiram McDaniels\n\n Cecil:\nSo, with a murderer on the loose in our community, fingers are\nstarting to be pointed. And most notably they are being pointed at\nHiram McDaniels, a former mayoral candidate and literal five-headed\ndragon\xe2\x80\xa6who attempted to murder our mayor not too long ago.\n\n So,\nin response, Hiram asked that he be allowed to speak on the air. And\nso, please welcome the five striking charismatic (and criminal) heads\nof Hiram McDaniels.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Thank you, Cecil.\n[clears throat] Now,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had some experience lately with the, uh, law, as it were.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: We face quite serious\ncharges with a maximum sentence of five life sentences, to be served\nconcurrently, by five different heads.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngray head: That\xe2\x80\x99s true, blue\nhead. And everyone is mad and yelling a lot, and it makes me feel\nsad.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head: I\xe2\x80\x99M\nMAD AND YELLING ALL OF THE TIME, AND THAT DOESN\xe2\x80\x99T MAKE YOU SAD!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngray head: Oh, sure, Green,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re right.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Okay, okay. Blue,\nGreen, Gray, all of you relax. Now, remember what we said.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: The dragon heads\nthat stand together are strong together!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, well that\xe2\x80\x99s very inspiring, violet head!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: Also, the tree of\nliberty must be refreshed from time to time with a mulch made from\nthe bones and organs of innocents!\n\n Cecil:\nOkay, now wait\xe2\x80\xa6what was that?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: What?\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I mean, I just heard your violet head say that there is\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: No! Nope. Sure\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if\nyou did. What matters is that since our troubles with the law, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen practicin\xe2\x80\x99 the art of disguise more. Previously we pretended to\nbe a human called Frank Chen. But now that everyone knows about the\nFrank Chen disguise, we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a new plan.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: We will disguise each\nof our heads as a different head. No one will know with which of our\nquintumbred they are speaking.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: For instance, which\nhead is this speaking?\n\n Mystery\n(gray) head: All of you are tiny\nand sad, I\xe2\x80\x99m also tiny and sad! Let\xe2\x80\x99s all be tiny and sad together,\nroar!\n\n Cecil:\nWell, that was the gray head.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: No, nah, nah, nah.\nListen to that rage, Cecil. Don't\xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it was\nthe\xe2\x80\xa6green head, maybe? Eh? Green?\n\n Cecil:\nNo, no, it was definitely the gray head, because I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I know,\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x93 I saw the\ngray head talking.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: All right, all right.\nBut\xe2\x80\xa6all right. Which head is this?\n\n Mystery\n(gold) head: Oh! Everything is a\nconspiracy, and I am untrusting of everyone! Look at how purple I am!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: I\xe2\x80\x99m violet, not\npurple!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Right, right. [Clears\nthroat]\n\n Mystery\n(gold) head: Eh\xe2\x80\xa6Uhhh\xe2\x80\xa6Look at\nhow violet I am, which is a word that means\npurple. Those are the same words, uhh, but I\xe2\x80\x99m particular about which\none, look at me!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: See, now, uh\xe2\x80\xa6which\nhead said that?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x93 I mean, you\ndid, gold head! I mean \xe2\x80\x93 Hi\xe2\x80\x93 Hiram, I can see each of you\ntalking!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: He\xe2\x80\x99s using his eyes\nagainst us. We need to do a blind test.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Yeah, that makes\nsense.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: Indeed. Most\nefficient would be a heated blade\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\n[Gasps]\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: \xe2\x80\xa6but the eyes could\nalso be manually removed.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, y\xe2\x80\x93 y\xe2\x80\x93 you know what? I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna turn my back, okay?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: Yes. I suppose that\nalso works. Now another head who is not me, the blue head, will\ncommence speaking.\n\n Mystery\n(blue) head: Life is sad, and I\nam sad, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to what any other heads tell me about\nregular exercise, or a few minutes spent outside occasionally. It is\nI, the sad gray head.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: So? Which head was\nspeaking there?\n\n Cecil:\nYou\xe2\x80\x93 I mean\xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0you\xe2\x80\x93 you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even change your voice, like, at\nall, blue head.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: He\xe2\x80\x99s peeking! He\xe2\x80\x99s\npeeking!\n\n Cecil:\nNo, I mean, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong way \xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: Remove his eyes!\n\n Cecil:\nNo! No no no no no no no! I mean, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take this the wrong\nway, but, I mean, not because you are a towering five-headed dragon,\nbut maybe, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re not terribly good at this.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: All right, then\nCecil. Uh\xe2\x80\xa6you might maybe be right about that.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head: Maybe we don\xe2\x80\x99t have\nthe proper technique and training for these kinds of charades.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: Maybe our\nconspiracy is a failed one!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngray head: Maybe we don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\ngreat about that.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: But then Cecil,\npartner, you explain one thing to us.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head: HOW\nEVERY VOICE YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE HEARD SINCE YOU LAST SPOKE WAS ACTUALLY ALL ME!\nTHE GREEN HEAD!\n\n Cecil:\nOh\xe2\x80\xa6oh my g\xe2\x80\x93 oh, well, Green, you are excellent\nat those voices, then!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head: OF\nCOURSE I AM! I LORD MY GREATNESS OVER YOU, HUMAN FILTH, LIKE A GOD IN\nANCIENT TIMES!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head, or so we assume for the moment:\nYeah, r\xe2\x80\x93 Green is real good at all that stuff, it turns out. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nprobably because Green is just naturally better than us at\neverything\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head: Oh! Hey? Did you hear\nthat? That was Green head again. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that last one.\n\n Cecil:\nIt\xe2\x80\xa6it sounds\xe2\x80\xa6okay, it sounds like you two have a lot to work out.\nSo\xe2\x80\xa6good luck with that.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head: I\nHAVE NO NEED FOR LUCK! I HAVE FIRE BREATH! FAREWELL, HUMAN!\n\n Cecil:\nOh, all right.\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Faceless Old Woman\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, I can see a slight movement in my periphery, and I can\nfeel just a gentle chilly touch along my neck. Oh, and also my coffee\nmug has moved from where it was, I mean just a moment ago, it\nwas\xe2\x80\xa6it was here on my left. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s upside down and on my\nright and crawling away on spider legs. Which is kind of unusual\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless\nOld Woman: Hello Cecil. It\xe2\x80\x99s me, the\nFaceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home.\n\n Cecil:\nHmm, I thought that was you! You know, it makes it kinda hard to talk\nto you when I can never really see you.\n\n FOW:\nCecil, there\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer on the loose, and everyone is going to\ndie. \n\n\n Cecil:\nI doubt that the murderer is gonna kill everyone.\n\n FOW:\nOh no, sorry for the confusion, those were two separate thoughts.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer on the loose, period. End of thought. Next:\nEveryone\xe2\x80\x99s going to die.\n\n Cecil:\nWell\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n FOW:\nEnd of second thought.\n\n Cecil:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a relief. Um\xe2\x80\xa6Hey, so you secretly live in every person\xe2\x80\x99s\nhome, right? So you must know who the murderer is.\n\n FOW:\nOh, I absolutely know who the murderer is. \n\n\n Cecil:\nGreat! So you can help us track down and find this criminal? \n\n\n FOW:\nSure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I know. The murderer has eaten hundreds of\nflies in their sleep. The murderer has shirts with buttons, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nremoved some of those buttons with an old knife I found in Pamela\nWinchell\xe2\x80\x99s mailbox. The murderer sometimes stares at birds.\nSometimes the birds stare back. Bird watching goes both ways.\n\n Did\nyou know birds talk? Not through something so manipulative and\ncorroded by history as words and sentences, but through the clear\nclean language of hunger and horror, and boredom, and rotary\nproductive desires. A chattering of starlings told me once, and I\nquote, \xe2\x80\x9cTree.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d They\nrepeated it over and over, and it was the most interesting story I\xe2\x80\x99ve\never heard.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, so do the birds know who the murderer is?\n\n FOW:\nI was in Tristan Cortez\xe2\x80\x99s house the other night and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nfind his remote. He just kept shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cStop it! You\xe2\x80\x99re the\nworst!\xe2\x80\x9d at his television. And\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nOkay\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n FOW:\n\xe2\x80\xa6I started to feel sad for him,\nbecause it was that Property Brothers episode where they keep taking\nout walls while lecturing the home buyers on the importance of an\nopen floor concept. They remove every single interior wall, and then\nthe outer walls of the home, and then the surrounding trees and\nvehicles and other homes and adjacent buildings, until everything is\ngone and all is void. And the closing credits of the episode are just\njumbles of letters drifting aimlessly on screen. To the whispers of,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen floor concept. Open floor concept.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Cecil:\nBut what-\n\n FOW:\nThey really\njumped the shark with that episode. So out of pity, I revealed to\nTristan where I hid his remote.\n\n Cecil:\nBut the murderer\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n FOW:\nIt was just behind his right eye. It took him a while to get it out,\nbut he finally did it because I gave him Pamela\xe2\x80\x99s old knife. Only\nnow his remote is all sticky and he has to get a new rug and couch.\n\n Cecil:\nOK, so is Tristan the murderer? I\xe2\x80\x99m confused here.\n\n FOW:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re all murderers, Cecil! Where do you think meat comes from?\n\n Cecil:\nOh uh, well meat\xe2\x80\xa6 \n\n\n FOW:\nIt sure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come from animals.\n\n Cecil:\n[long beat]\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6Wait, where does\nmeat come from?!\n\n FOW:\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish my story. In conclusion, I know who the murderer\nis. Everything will be fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a close watch on the\nsituation. I won\xe2\x80\x99t stop anything from happening, but I will watch\nit closely. \n\n\n Cecil:\nWell, Faceless Old Woman\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Well\nlisteners, it appears she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Dana Cardinal\n\n Cecil:\nOur municipal government is obviously concerned with today\xe2\x80\x99s\nemergency situation, and has asked me to give some time to my former\nintern and our current mayor, Mayor Dana Cardinal. So let\xe2\x80\x99s welcome\nher now!\n\n Dana:\nThank you, Cecil.\n\n Hello,\nmembers of the public. Hello, day-pass members of the public. Hello,\ninvited guests of the public, junior initiates of the public, and of\ncourse members of the secret orders, who are definitely not here and\nnot all waving enthusiastically and holding up invisible secret order\npennants in the front row.\n\n Cecil:\nHmm. \n\n\n Dana:\nI speak to you today not as a mayor, but as a friend. So if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not friends with me, sorry, this one isn\xe2\x80\x99t for you. \n\n\n Cecil:\nGo on.\n\n Dana:\nI know that having a murderer on the loose is scary. It is\nfrightening to be reminded that you could die at any moment. It is\nfrightening to know that a member of your community holds evil in\ntheir hearts. It is frightening when a mask-wearing employee of a\nhaunted house jumps out at you shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBoo!\xe2\x80\x9d Turbulence when\nI\xe2\x80\x99m flying also freaks me out. This is just a list of some things\nthat are frightening. Not all of them immediately apply. \n\n\n Cecil\nwas kind enough to give me some time on this microphone, because I\nused my municipal powers to take this airtime, whether he wanted me\nto or not. I rely on the kindness of others, but also if others\naren\xe2\x80\x99t kind, I can take care of things myself.\n\n Murder\nis a rare threat in Night Vale. \n\n\n By\nthe way, have you ever noticed how \xe2\x80\x9cthreat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctreat\xe2\x80\x9d are\nalmost the same word? I have. I notice it a lot and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\nwrote \xe2\x80\x9cthreat\xe2\x80\x9d here in this speech, just to challenge myself to\nsay the correct word. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m doubting that I said the right word.\nI hope I said the right word. \n\n\n And\nno one in town quite knows how to handle a murderer, so here is some\nadvice from murder experts that could help keep you safe. \n\n\n The\nfirst step is to make yourself bigger than the murderer. Stand as\ntall as you can, put on lots of layers of clothes and drink\nembiggening potions to make yourself as large as you can possibly be.\nThe murderer will be less likely to attack if you have drunk many\npotions, growing unnaturally until you resemble a skyscraper, or a\ncliff base, or a very large person. \n\n\n Also\ndo not make eye contact with the murderer. That could be taken as a\nsign of aggression. It is safest if you remove your eyes completely.\nThat may sound difficult, but actually the physical actions required\nto do that are nightmarishly simple and horribly possible to do with\njust your hands. \n\n\n Avoid\nany sudden movements and certainly do not run. Running might cause\nyou to lose weight, and remember we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to look bigger than\nthe murderer. \n\n\n The\nmurderer may just be attacking you defensively to protect their cubs.\nIf so, you may be able to prove you are not by threat by playing\ndead, or by being murdered right away. Simply play dead or just go\nahead and get murdered. By appearing or being dead, the murderer will\nnot presume you to be dangerous, and thus will leave you alone. \n\n\n [sighs]\n\n The\nNight Vale City Government hopes that this information has been\nhelpful to you. I hope that this information has been helpful to you.\nI care about you, all of you. I care about you, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nThanks Dana, I\xe2\x80\xa6thank you for the advice. Um, it was, it was good to\nspeak to you again.\n\n Dana:\nOh you too, Cecil. I always like being on your show.\n\n Cecil:\nYeah!\n\n Dana:\nOK, I should go. I need to put on my mayoral cloak and then drink\nsome embiggening potions.\n\n Cecil:\nAll right. Thank you, Mayor Cardinal. \n\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Kevin\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, do you hear that? There\xe2\x80\x99s this strange noise. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s like the lowest note on a piano. [low\nnote] No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it. It\xe2\x80\x99s like\na short scale but using only the black keys. [short\nscale with only the black keys] No,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it either. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. Oh! The noise is exactly similar\nto\xe2\x80\xa6winter. [the first chords of Tori\nAmos\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cWinter\xe2\x80\x9d]\n\n Do\nyou hear that noise? It seems to be coming from my broadcasting\nequipment. It\xe2\x80\x93 it seems like someone is trying to talk to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike\xe2\x80\xa6It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone is approaching the microphone, and is\nabout to speak.\n\n Kevin:\nHi, friends! This is Kevin! Radio host of Desert Bluffs. Is this\nCecil of Night Vale? \n\n\n Cecil:\nMm-hmm. \n\n\n Kevin:\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve missed you, old friend! We hardly ever talk anymore!\n\n Cecil:\nLast time we talked, you were representing a giant corporation that\ntried to enslave our town, so yes, good point. We hardly ever talk\nanymore. \n\n\n Kevin:\nWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let small town feuds get in the way of our friendship.\n\n\n\n Cecil:\nNo, we definitely should! Additionally, I do not like Desert Bluffs\nsports teams.\n\n Kevin:\nYes, sports rivalries are fun! They\xe2\x80\x99re like friendships, but with\nless sublimated anger and more ritualized shouting.\n\n Cecil:\nNow wait, Kevin, why are you interrupting my radio transmission? \n\n\n Kevin:\nWell, I heard something. A noise. It sounded just like Zayn leaving\nOne Direction. [creepy music]\nOh yes, there it is again. I heard the noise, and I ran to my radio\nstudio and, well here we are. What a strange thing, the happenstance\nof the universe causing us to meet by chance again and again. Also, I\nhave a frequency jammer. I jammed your transmission, and that noise\nis the sound it makes. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s another element to the story. If\nyou believe in things like stories, or truth. I just wanted to see\nhow you were doing! Hi! How are you doing? \n\n\n Cecil:\nWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer on the loose in my city. And now there\xe2\x80\x99s\nyou on the\nloose in my headphones. \n\n\n Kevin:\nHa ha ha ha! You are one of the funniest people I know! I never quite\nunderstand your jokes. That is why we\xe2\x80\x99re such close friends!\n\n Cecil:\nKevin, we are not friends! You tried to enslave our city, with\xe2\x80\xa6with\nhelicopters and armed guards and a smiling God! \n\n\n Kevin:\nOh sure, I remember all of that. But try to see it from my point of\nview! I mean not literally. Not like, pull your eyes out and jam them\nstill bloody into my skull. [chuckles]\nWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, because we\xe2\x80\x99re only talking via radio right\nnow. Let\xe2\x80\x99s use a sports metaphor. Do you remember that famous game\nbetween Desert Bluffs and Night Vale, where the officials made a\ncontroversial interpretation of league rules?\n\n Cecil:\nAre we talking about football or\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\n Kevin:\nOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember all the minor details. \n\n\n Cecil:\nI mean, was the field shaped like a diamond or was it like\nrectangular?\n\n Kevin:\nI remember everyone was wearing numbers. And right above the numbers\nwere big bar codes, to allow referees to track the players. So I\nguess that could be any sport.\n\n Cecil:\nIce? Was it on ice?\n\n Kevin:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what ice is.\n\n Cecil:\nAlright, I guess that rules out basketball then.\n\n Kevin:\nThe point is, Cecil, that people process the world the way their\npeers process the world. Like that noise we heard before. I mean, I\nheard it one way, you heard it another. For me, it was very similar\nto the end of a multi-city national tour. [notes\nthat suddenly distort] \n\n\n Cecil:\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous! Clearly it sounds like the beginning of\nanother international tour. [same exact\nnotes] \n\n\n Kevin:\nExactly. But someone somewhere else might hear it differently. Those\npeople might hear it as subtle cinematic scoring underneath a\ndramatic speech. [grandiose music]\nSee? We don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the cosmic justice of the sports\nofficials\xe2\x80\x99 judgment. We look to see if it favors our town or\nsociety, and then we selfishly react.\n\n Right\nnow, there\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer on the loose in Night Vale, and you\xe2\x80\x99re\nworried because you care about your community. You fear for your\nsafety and the safety of those you love. But you only feel that way\nbecause you are a potential victim of death or \xe2\x80\x93 much much worse \xe2\x80\x93\na potential victim of loss. How do you think the murderer must feel?\nKnowing that everyone is scared of and angry at them. I bet that\nmakes the murderer feel pretty bad about themself.\n\n Cecil:\nWhat??\n\n Kevin:\nI try to see things from both points of view. Every story has two\nequal sides. Yes, there is a murderer on the loose, and murder is\nillegal. But also, there\xe2\x80\x99s a poor citizen, a human being (maybe)\nwho is being ostracized from society because of who they are and what\nthey like to do. That is equally sad. A sports team might win on a\nbad call, but they might also lose on a good call. That is equally\nunjust. A radio host might join a tyrannical corporation that tries\nto subjugate all of Night Vale, but Night Vale might also fight back\nillegally, unfairly forcing that radio host to lose his job. That is\nequally tragic. [deep sigh]\nI just wanted to tell you that\xe2\x80\xa6I feel no ill will between us over\nthe whole \xe2\x80\x9carmed takeover of your town\xe2\x80\x9d thing. [sighs]\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t really feel anything anymore. But I can smile. Smile very\nwide. Want to hear? \n\n\n Cecil:\nDefinitely not! \n\n\n Kevin:\nOh, listen to my smile! \n\n\n Cecil:\nOh hey, the music totally stopped all of a sudden! [music\nstops] I bet that means you have to go\nnow. \n\n\n Kevin:\nNo, really it\xe2\x80\x99s no bother, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a delightful time!\n\n Cecil:\n[fake-cheerily]\nMe too, me too! Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s try pushing this button that says\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrequency unjammer\xe2\x80\x9d!\n\n Kevin:\nOh don\xe2\x80\x99t push that, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound fun at all! \n\n\n Cecil:\nAnd there we go.\n\n Kevin:\nIt looks like I\xe2\x80\x99m losing your signal! [voice\nfading out] Until next\ntime, Cecil, until next time!\n\n BONUS\nTRACK: Lacey Hernez\n\n Cecil:\nAn update on last week\xe2\x80\x99s power outages. The Night Vale electric\nutility announced today that there may be more power outages in\nupcoming weeks. This time, due to\xe2\x80\xa6sadness. For more on this, we\nturn to municipal call rep, Lacey Hernez. Hey, Lacey!\n\n Lacey\nHernez: Oh hello, Cecil!\n\n Cecil:\nSo, uh, power outages, huh? \n\n\n Lacey:\nAbsolutely. And it makes sense. The electric utility has been sad\nthis week. Not for any reason, sometimes they get sad. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nfair to expect them to have a reason. For instance, last week they\nwere feeling vengeful, and so they got their revenge using the weapon\nof power outages. This week, they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling sad, so they\xe2\x80\x99re\nworking through that using the medium of power outages.\n\n Cecil:\nBut what about those of us who need electricity to see in the dark,\nor maintain life support or most importantly, listen to the radio? \n\n\n Lacey:\nAh, well. You see, power outages were certified by the Supreme Court\nas a protected form of free speech in the 1973 case of Hayworth\nElectrical Company versus the Hayworth Hospital. You see, the court\nstated very clearly that reasonable causes for a power outage include\ncelebration of a special someone\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, expression of\nundirected anger at an intransigent political system, and periods of\njust feeling sad for no reason. And\xe2\x80\xa6and please remember:\ndisagreeing with someone\xe2\x80\x99s speech, or even just frowning within a\n48-hour period of them making it, is basically the same as repressing\nit. It says so right in the Constitution.\n\n Cecil:\nOoh well, fair enough.\n\n Lacey:\nMm hmm, yeah.\n\n Cecil:\nNow Lacey, do you have any idea how long the power outages might\nlast? \n\n\n Lacey:\nOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Couple days, couple weeks, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. The\nelectric company has a lot to work through. They don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say\nthis themselves, but recently, the gas works stopped speaking to\nthem. No one knows exactly what the fallout was about, but electric\nhas been real down ever since.\n\n Cecil:\nAww, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. But you know what? I never thought the gas\nworks was very good for them anyway.\n\n Lacey:\nOh, oh, I know, I agree! The gas works might seem nice if you just\neat lunch together sometimes, or hang out with them at a party once\nin a while, or use their services to heat your home, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nthink they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever committed to caring about anyone. I once cooked\nan entire meal on my gas range, only for gas works to not call or\ntext me for days after!\n\n Cecil:\nUgh!\n\n Lacey:\nDid\nthat dinner not mean anything?\n\n Cecil:\nUgh!\n\n Lacey:\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve the electric company. \n\n\n Cecil:\nYeah!\n\n Lacey:\nMm. Anyway, more importantly, the electric company is sad, because\nsometimes utility companies just get sad. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just say,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll get better,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPlease turn my\nelectricity back on!\xe2\x80\x9d and expect everything to be fine. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\nneed some good, long power outages to work through this. \n\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I am really sorry to hear that. Can\xe2\x80\xa6can you let me know\xe2\x80\xa6or\nlet them know that I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about them?\n\n Lacey:\nI sure will! That\xe2\x80\x99s very kind. Now that I have you feeling\nemotionally prostrate and vulnerable, please remember that power\noutages are no excuse to not pay your electric bill. \n\n\n Cecil:\nReally? Because it seems like\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Lacey:\nElectricity is a privilege, not a right. Failure to pay electric\nbills may result in localized lightning storms, shrouded figures\nstanding silently in the background of familiar TV shows, and gout. \n\n\n Cecil:\nWell, you could have just said \xe2\x80\x9cgout.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nto list all of its primary symptoms.\n\n Lacey:\nWell. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s been nice chatting with you as always but I should\ngo. It looks like the water company\xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0[track\nends abruptly]"
