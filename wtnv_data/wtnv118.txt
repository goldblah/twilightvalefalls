Episode 99 - Michigan
b'Here comes the sun. Here comes the sun. Here comes the sun. It does not stop. Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n To start today\xe2\x80\x99s show, I wanted to talk a bit about our indomitable radio intern, Kareem. He\xe2\x80\x99s become such a talented reporter here at the station. Kareem told me this morning that he had written to his family back in his home state in Mitchigan.. Mi.. Mitchigan, to tell them about all the recent events he\xe2\x80\x99s reported on. Like the five-headed dragons and the strangers led by that horrible beagle, and the reopening of the laser tag center at the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex. They must be really proud of you, Kareem, and all the great work you do. The fantastic stories you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to cover here at your internship. Thank you for your good work.\n\n And now, an update. Many of you have written in with your concerns over Old Woman Josie. Well, good news, listeners. After suffering a broken hip and a series of infections that kept her bedridden most of that time, she is feeling much better. She still needs a cane and occasionally a wheelchair to relieve bodily exhaustion, but she is out and about. I got to see her last Tuesday at the Desert Flower for bowling league night. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to bowl in nearly a year, but she has not lost any of her skills. She came with her many friends named Erika who claim to be.. [whispers] angels! She bowled a perfect store, cane and all. Her delivery did seem a bit weaker than usual, and her friends often stood right behind her as she rolled the ball. The Erikas would hum, and close their many eyes, and lift their many arms slowly into the air, and Josie\xe2\x80\x99s ball would straighten out, pick up speed, and demolish all ten pins. The opposing team complained she was cheating, receiving help from angels, but that team was promptly arrested for acknowledging the angels\xe2\x80\x99 existence and had to forfeit. Josie, being a good sport, protested their arrest and said the Erikas were indeed angels, and that we should all be free to acknowledge them. No one wanted to arrest a debilitated old woman, so they left it alone.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad my friend is feeling better. She looks quite a bit older than I remember, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad she\xe2\x80\x99s back at the bowling alley.\n\n Oh? OK. Kareem is telling me I apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell his whole story earlier. I thought we were just talking about what a good job he did, but I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s more. OK then. Kareem says after he wrote his family, he did not receive back a letter of pride and congratulations. He got a letter that said, \xe2\x80\x9cLIES!!!!\xe2\x80\x9d in all capital letters and several exclamation marks. It continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a liar. You are a liar and we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you are doing this to us. Please do not write us again. You are an imposter.\xe2\x80\x9d It is then signed, \xe2\x80\x9cAisha\xe2\x80\x9d. Kareem tells me that this is indeed his mother\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting and that is her name. I told him that parents don\xe2\x80\x99t always communicate their love exactly how we would like. Radio is not a lucrative business. Maybe she is just expressing motherly concerns about his career choice and well-being. \n\n He says she\xe2\x80\x99s always been so loving and supportive, so my explanation makes no sense. Part of an internship is learning to receive feedback, Kareem. Well, thanks for the whole story.\n\n And now an update on the dragons. After last month\xe2\x80\x99s accidental murder of one of Hiram McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 five heads, Hadassah McDaniels, Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s sister, her lawyer Miriam and several other dragons from whatever world they came from, have taken up hopefully temporary residence in Night Vale, claiming they will not leave until they get retribution, by which I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping they just meant a heartfelt apology. \n\n No one has seen or heard from Hiram since the tragedy. Hadassah dug a cave beneath the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, where all dragons are now living. Weekday shift manager Charlie Bear said the heat of the dragons\xe2\x80\x99 cumulative breath, even underground, has ruined their produce section. Most of the greens have wilted. The whole store smells like onions now, he said. Bear added, \xe2\x80\x9cTo be fair, the dragons have been coming up to shop for groceries, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to complain about new business, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t like our selection of meats and have been eating a few of our regular customers. And we can\xe2\x80\x99t have that. Or I guess we can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as they pay for whatever food they take, which they\xe2\x80\x99ve been good about, so..\xe2\x80\x9d And then he rattled the loose change in both pockets and lit a cigarette with just his mind. \n\n And now.. ugh, oh god. OK, I thought I was just going to do a quick spotlight on a good intern to start the show, but Kareem is nudging me again, listeners. Apparently, I left some details out of his story. Not everything needs to be a 100 percent accurate account of your personal history, Kareem! This is a radio show, not Patrick Rothfus\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Name of the Wind\xe2\x80\x9d. Your demand for details makes me look bad!\n\n Listeners, Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s really focused on correcting every little fact, which makes him a good reporter.. but also kind of a snitch. So, to start. It seems I\xe2\x80\x99ve been mispronouncing Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Mitchigan. How do you say it, Kareem? Mitchigan? Right, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying. Mitchigan. Mmmitcchigan. Mmisshtigan. Mishhigan. Mishhtigan. OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Kareem, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t hear the nuances of your regional accent. \n\n The point is, listeners, Kareem said that he had sent a second letter home to his family, asking if everything was OK, and if they were happy with his career and how he is living his life. He just wanted to make them proud. He received another letter back in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. The letter read: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son Kareem is in my home. I am looking at him right now. He is tall. He has long black hair and green eyes. He is a beautiful and honest and hardworking boy. He has a birth mark on his right hand, shaped like a salamander. This is not you. You are not this person.\xe2\x80\x9d The letter continued: \xe2\x80\x9cKareem is in college studying broadcast journalism. He is not you. I do not know you. Who are you? Why are you pretending to be my son? We cannot find any record of a town called Night Vale anywhere. Please stop writing me, whoever you are.\xe2\x80\x9d And then it is signed \xe2\x80\x9cAisha\xe2\x80\x9d. Kareem, you are tall, with long black hair and green eyes. You have a birthmark on your right hand. It\xe2\x80\x99s shaped more like a lizard though, so maybe you have the wrong house? Who knows. Just one of those things, I guess. Anyway, thanks for the story, Kareem! \n\n And now an update on our schools. The enormous Glow Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 all hail \xe2\x80\x93 which serves as president of the Night Vale School Board, called for an increase in education funding to support the influx of new students. After the annexation of neighboring town Desert Bluffs, as well as the new five-headed dragon kids that arrived with the five-headed dragon delegation, Night Vale schools desperately need more teachers and classrooms. Not to mention additional fireproofing. The Glow Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 all praise the mighty Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 delivered this message via press release scrawled in thick paint across several dead animals, which had dropped from its great translucent body above town. It took reporters several hours to place each of the animals in the correct order to make sense of the press release, but they think they got it. Mayor Dana Cardinal and Sheriff Sam sent out their own press releases, claiming a lack of available funding for the schools. The Mayor said she will look into it, but does not want to raise taxes. The Sheriff simply growled and fired a pistol into a target dummy shaped like a dragon. The City Council, minus newest member Tamika Flynn, shrieked and then left on a beach vacation, saying they needed an increase in sunlight and tropical drinks and that, so what if sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t call? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t into a relationship, just that sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re busy. Here at the radio studio, our brokenhearted Station Management cried quietly in their office, which was a truly off-putting and strange sound. \n\n The Glow Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 we are not worthy to rub our faces in the mud before its beneficent presence, oh Maker and Unmaker of All Things \xe2\x80\x93 indicated that it would continue to bring up this issue at school board meetings. More on this story as it develops. \n\n Oh god, Kareem, really? Grrr. OK, Kareem is now telling me that he called his parents to talk to them about the letters they sent to him, but a familiar voice answered the phone. It was not his father Raheem, nor his brother Amir.. it was him. [music distorts] Kareem answered his own phone call. Kareem tried to explain who he was to himself, but the other Kareem said that it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be true, that there was only one him, and he was it. Kareem asked to speak with his mother, but Kareem said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know your mother, I only know my mother\xe2\x80\x9d and hung up. Kareem said he wanted to go home to see his family. I told him he might be confused by it, but to take a close look at a map of the United States. He did, and was dismayed to find there was no Mintchigan. Mitchigan? Minchigan, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s it, right? He said his home state should be right between Oheeo and Canada, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s shaped like a mitten. I said he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of Maine which looks like a mitten that\xe2\x80\x99s been wadded up, and you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at it from like a side angle. He said the US map looks correct when he stares at the whole thing, but when he looks closely at where Mitchigan shold be,it\xe2\x80\x99s not there. He\xe2\x80\x99s now pacing in the cubicle area, pulling at his hair, sweating. I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about him. He\xe2\x80\x99s never quite behaved like this before. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna tell him to go home, visit his family, take some time off work. While I do that, Here is today\xe2\x80\x99s weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet Americans\xe2\x80\x9d by Shearwater]\n\n Kareem is back already. Said he spent the last two weeks at home. I told him he\xe2\x80\x99d been gone about five minutes, you know, long enough to report the weather. But he pointed to the calendar and, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be darned, he\xe2\x80\x99s right! It\xe2\x80\x99s been two weeks! Huh. That weather report took wayy longer than I thought. Kareem said he took a flight to Grand Rapids, but when he landed, he was back in Night Vale. He tried several flights, even to some of the cities of Detroix and Chycago, neither of which I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of, hoping to just catch a bus or something from there, but all flights landed back at the Night Vale airport. Now Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s a good intern, but not very knowledgeable of how air travel works. The whole point is the joy of flying, not the destination. No one likes going places. They just like the comfort of flying. Airlines send you in the air for a few hours and serve you good food while you relax. Then, they take you home.\n\n The airport having failed him, Kareem got in his car and drove to Mintchigan. He kept getting lost and ending back up where he started, but after days of trying, he finally arrived. He found his family was there, joyfully surprised to see him. He told them about the letters he sent and the ones he received. He was crying. They said they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard from him in ages and were starting to get worried. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive or write any letters. He asked if he was already there. \xe2\x80\x9cWas I home this whole time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his mother. She just hugged him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re here now.\xe2\x80\x9d He asked Amir: \xe2\x80\x9cWas I here? Did you see me here while I was gone?\xe2\x80\x9d Amir said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll always be here, Kareem.\xe2\x80\x9d He asked his father: \xe2\x80\x9cAre dragons real? Are there other worlds? Is Satan a beagle puppy?\xe2\x80\x9d His father laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou were always the funny one!\xe2\x80\x9d They embraced.\xc2\xa0\n\n Kareem stayed for a few days. They had dinners together and watched movies. Kareem tried to talk about his time in Night Vale, but found he was not able to remember any of it. He eventually could not even remember the name of this town he\xe2\x80\x99d been living in for two years, and after a while, he forgot that he had ever been anywhere else at all. He had forgotten Night Vale and his people in his mind, but not in his body. He could feel he was supposed to be somewhere else. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be anywhere else, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it was his decision. He fought this feeling for days. Finally, one day, his father asked if he wanted to go see a University of Mitchigan football game. Raheem said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a talented team this year. It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly 20 years since they won a title.\xe2\x80\x9d Kareem said he thought they won a championship two years ago with someone named Sandero at quarterback. His father said that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, the team was terrible two years ago. Kareem had some errands to run, so he told his family he would meet them at the game. He got in his car, fully intending to see them in less than an hour, but instead he drove and drove, not knowing to where. And after several days with no map or destination, he arrived back in Night Vale. And he remembered his life here again. He called his mother when he got home to tell her he was safe, but she only screamed into the phone saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! You\xe2\x80\x99re here! I\xe2\x80\x99m looking right at you! Kareem, you\xe2\x80\x99re here in my home you\xe2\x80\x99re right here in my home. How are you calling me?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n I love our internship program. Kareem has become an excellent reporter and editor. Maybe one day he will replace me here at the station, who knows. But beyond professional development, I want our interns to learn the bigger lessons of life, and love, and family, and death. Kareem hasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought much about aging, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, but as we get older, as we leave home, we form for ourselves an independent identity, no longer impressed upon by families. We take the last shape they crafted, a partially chiseled stone sculpture, and we are left to try to finish the work ourselves. Hopefully, they have provided good tools. Hopefully, the world teaches us how to better use them. And for the rest of our lives, we are gently hammering away at the curves and crevices of the great masterpieces that are our lives. Sometimes,as we work, we become less recognizable to the families who first shaped us. They critique the craftsmanship, the artistic direction, they worry too much has been cut away or that, quote, \xe2\x80\x9cthose arms just don\xe2\x80\x99t look proportional\xe2\x80\x9d. In some cases, they no longer recognize us for the adults we are. Family expectations are high. But underneath it all, there\xe2\x80\x99s love, and worry, and a knowledge that you will do right for yourself. Your family may not trust that knowledge, but they know they have to try. Kareem is back at his desk, staring at a map of the US, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look fearful or worried anymore. He looks like a young man \xe2\x80\x93 a grown man, but still a young man with a purpose. He is a journalist, doing a journalist\xe2\x80\x99s job: to seek truths, to understand the world. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of him.\n\n Proud of you, Kareem! [chuckles] He\xe2\x80\x99s giving a thumbs up. OK, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about your editing though, that weather report was like wayyy too long, like five minutes max, OK?\n\n Stay tuned next for the slow, low sounds of enormous plates shifting deep below us. Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking off work in a couple weeks to.. well, just to take some time off. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch again in the new year. \n\n As always, Good night, Night Vale, good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: A 4-star hotel will put a mint on your pillow, while a 5-star hotel will put candy bars in your butt.\xc2\xa0'
