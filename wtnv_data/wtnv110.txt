Episode 91 - The 12:37
b"Do not bite the hand that feeds you.\nGrab it first. Take the keys. Set yourself free. Then\nbite the hand\xe2\x80\xa6and run.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n Exciting\nnews for rail enthusiasts (and fans of punctuality): the 12:37 train\nto Red Mesa has arrived on time at Night Vale Station.\n\n Uhhhhh,\nsort of\non time. Night vale has not had\na train station or train service in a little over a century. So the\ntrain is about a hundred years late. This is, naturally, a cause of\nsome confusion at the moment.\n\n The\nstation, which used to be where the Little League baseball fields are\nright now, was decommissioned and torn down after it was discovered\nthe tracks just sort of ended in the middle of the desert, connecting\nto nothing.\n\n The\nSheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police have encircled the train, which is stopped\nright in the second base line, and has not opened its doors. It is\nnot yet clear where the train came from, if there are any passengers,\nand if there are, what condition they are in.\n\n Sheriff\nSam announced that they are an avid rail enthusiast \xe2\x80\x93 or, as they\ncalled themself, a train spotter. They whittled a small caboose out\nof a block of balsa to demonstrate their enthusiasm. They also\nrepeatedly pronounced my name as \xe2\x80\x9cSessil\xe2\x80\x9d too, so do with that\ninformation what you will.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ll\nkeep bringing you the latest on this story.\n\n In\nother news, there\xe2\x80\x99s a crowd of several hundred people gathering over\non Somerset. They have organized themselves into a tidy single-file\nline. None of them can say what\nthey are lined up for, nor where the front of the line is.\n\n Neighborhood\nresident Wayne Ferry said he got in line around 7:00 this morning,\nand it was already pretty large by that point. He\xe2\x80\x99s not sure how far\nback he is in the line.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsaw my friend Charelle and said, \xe2\x80\x98Morning, Charelle!\xe2\x80\x99 I and then kept\nwalking toward the back of the line,\xe2\x80\x9d Wayne said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I kept\npassing Charelle. 'Morning, Charelle!\xe2\x80\x99 I said each time. Eventually,\nshe let me cut in line.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Wayne\nsaid the line collapses back on itself. There is no beginning or end,\neven though it appears to be perfectly straight. More and more people\nare joining the line just to find out what everyone is in line for.\n\n Wayne\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for must be pretty cool!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n You\nhave to admire such childlike optimism, even though optimism is\ndoomed to almost certain disappointment and/or injury.\n\n We\nhave more on the 12:37 train to Red Mesa. Dozens of volunteers have\narrived to take selfies in front of the old-timey steam engine. And\nalso to weep in terror at the sudden anachronism.\n\n Sheriff\nSam applauded these civic-minded helpers by kettling them into a\nsmall chicken wire pen and shouting at them with an electric\nbullhorn.\n\n Sheriff\nSam, as part of the police investigation into this mysterious train,\nconstructed a wrought iron abstract statue seemingly depicting a bird\ndevouring a snake. We think\nit\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to symbolize man\xe2\x80\x99s inhumanity to man, and the frightful\nconditions in which immigrants were exploited in the building of our\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s railways. Also, the iron construction surely\nrepresents the indomitability of American capitalism, but anyone who\nlooks directly at any form of art gets a headache, and trying to\nunderstand art is usually fatal, so no one is certain.\n\n [Ahem]\nUh, how did the train get here with no tracks? Where did it come\nfrom? And now that there\xe2\x80\x99s a giant metal sculpture in its way, how\nwill it leave? How much would a ticket even be\nin today\xe2\x80\x99s dollars? Who are the people gathering about the baseball\nfields wearing deer masks?\n\n Oh.\nBreaking news. Some people wearing deer masks are gathering by the\ntrain, distributing roaches to bystanders. The roaches all have\nphrases printed on them, things like \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness in the front, knife\nin the back\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c#NotAllTrains.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Weird.\n\n Listeners,\nyour guess is as good as mine. Well, almost. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty good at\nguessing things.\n\n And\nnow, traffic.\n\n You\nare driving on a foggy night. There are faint taillights from a car\nin front of you. There are also faint headlights from a car behind\nyou, all moving at a steady 30 miles per hour.\n\n But\nthen the lights of the other cars just switch off, at the same time.\nAre the other cars still there? It\xe2\x80\x99s too foggy to see. Should you\nslow down? Speed up? If you slow down, the car behind might hit you.\nIf you speed up, you might hit the car in front. Best to stay at 30.\n\n But\nyour speedometer is creeping up to 35. The pressure has put you on\nedge. Your boss, Catherine, has been really on your case lately, and\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re pressing your foot down without realizing.\n\n Now\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re at 40. Should you go back to 30? What if the cars are still\nthere, matching your speed? Is going back to 30 safe? Should you stay\nat 40?\n\n Wait\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s\n50 now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been so worried about driving at 40 and lingering on\nwhat Catherine said to you about terrible quarter two sales, your\nspeed has crept up again.\n\n You\nimagine three cars speeding through the night, all of you mere inches\naway from a bone-crunching, life-changing, possibly life-ending\ncollision, before you know it you\xe2\x80\x99re doing 60, then 70, then 80. 80!\n\n You\ncan scarcely believe it. I mean, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that Tina\xe2\x80\x99s\naccount and not yours that failed? How is quarter two your fault?\n\n You\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t possibly slow down now.\nThe car behind won\xe2\x80\x99t have time to reduce their speed. And where is\nthe car in front of you?\n\n At\nleast the road is straight\xe2\x80\xa6or is\nit?\nAnd, are you even still on the road? Is there any way to know? All\naround you is fog. If you crash, even if you survive, will anyone\nfind the wreckage to save you?\n\n Without\nnoticing, you have lifted your foot and the car has slowed down to\n60. You keep your foot off the gas, and your car keeps slowing.\n50\xe2\x80\xa640\xe2\x80\xa630\xe2\x80\xa620\xe2\x80\xa610\xe2\x80\xa6and then zero. You have stopped. No crashes,\nno screeching tires.\n\n You\nput on the parking brake and get out of your car, and walk off into\nthe mist, your face tight and tear-stained. You think about how Tina\ntakes such long smoke breaks, and Catherine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say a thing about\nthat.\n\n The\nmist coats your cold skin, and you hear birds just above you.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n We\nhave an exciting update from the baseball fields! The train has\nopened its doors. Nobody has disembarked yet. It looks\ncompletely empty. The Secret Police are keeping a safe distance while\npolitely shouting at the kettled witnesses to board the train and see\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s up. A few are reluctantly going in.\n\n The\nfigures in deer masks, looking like the same transit lovers who built\nthe Night Vale subway system three years ago, are in an inverted V\nformation out in left center field, their shoulders and heads bobbing\nas if in silent laughter.\n\n So\nfar, none of the\xe2\x80\xa6umm\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cvolunteers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6.have come back out,\ndespite the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police\xe2\x80\x99s repeated friendly warnings and\nhelpful bullhorn threats.\n\n The\nCity Council could not be reached for comment on the train, as this\nwhole situation has unfortunately clashed with their annual (and\ninaugural) charity golf tournament, somewhere far away from any\npossible danger. Also, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to call them for a\ncomment.\n\n Teddy\nWilliams, owner of the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun\nComplex, announced that after 20 years, the Laser Tag Adventure Pit\nis reopening this weekend. In a contrite statement released this\nweek, Teddy says he finally figured out how to lower the power\nsettings on the lasers.\n\n According\nto Williams\xe2\x80\x99 written statement, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper sorry, like wow, it never\noccurred to me that\xe2\x80\xa6anyway, things are fine now. Also, I know a\ndoctor who specializes in limb reattachment,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement reads.\n\n The\nstatement continued, \xe2\x80\x9cLike, spiders with eight legs can afford to\nlose a few, right? But us humans, with just the two? Crap! Really,\nwhat was I thinking? Sorry. I mean, nobody died\nor anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Teddy said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I apologized, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? But Cecil\njust gets on the radio, reading out stories in that condescending way\nhe does, putting on silly voices, making a mockery of my punctuation\nand vernacular prose, turning everything into an incredibly long\nsentence with a lot of sub-clauses and tangents that wander out, like\nbranching paths in a forest, so that when you take one forking path\nand then it turns into another path you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s a new path\nor just the same path you were already on, or maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve just gone\nin a circle, and anyway the whole quote takes so long to say that you\nforget it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s words until he says 'Teddy said\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d\nTeddy said.\n\n Well.\nListeners, I\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need to read the rest of his statement.\nBut I will mention that for reopening weekend at the Laser Tag\nAdventure Pit, there\xe2\x80\x99s a 20% discount on admission, and everyone gets\na release form absolutely free!\n\n An\nupdate from the baseball fields: the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police boarded\nthe train, and did not come back out. Shortly before they boarded,\nthey warned the remaining witnesses not to board the train. Then,\nshortly after the Secret Police boarded, the witnesses themselves\nboarded the train\xe2\x80\xa6and also didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back out.\n\n Many\npeople have been seen leaving their homes, schools, and places of\nbusiness to walk toward the station, all excited to take selfies and\nsob in existential horror at this rift in not only time and space,\nbut also our trust in basic physics.\n\n The\nfigures in the deer masks are all crouched, pounding the ground with\ntheir open palms.\n\n There\nare now more people on the train than its capacity for passengers,\nbut people are still boarding, effortlessly disappearing inside.\nNight Vale is emptying.\nEveryone wants to board the train.\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6I\nfeel the same urge that all of you do to board the train, listeners,\nand if it were not for my strict professionalism and commitment to\nthis show, I would be on that train myself. But I must resist. I will\nstay here in my studio\xe2\x80\xa6and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n You\nknow what? Never mind. Yeah. Uh-huh. I gotta go see this. Okay. Uh,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s just go to the weather.\n\n [Studio\ndoor opens and closes]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cWindows\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Angel Olsen]\n\n Listeners,\nI am back. I am back in the radio booth.\n\n The\n12:37 train to\xe2\x80\xa6wherever\n(certainly not to Red Mesa) is gone.\n\n As\nthe doors closed on us inside the passenger cars, we heard the\nthrumming of the massive engine, the churning of gears and wheels, a\ngreat steam whistle. Looking out the windows I saw the baseball\ndiamond, I saw houses and trees, I felt us moving, gaining speed,\naccelerating. I felt it in my ears. But the cars, trees, houses, the\nbaseball fields, did not seem to move at all\xe2\x80\xa6at first.\n\n Then\nthe trees withdrew into the ground. The houses disassembled\nthemselves. Distant power poles and tall buildings vanished. There\nwere more plants, more water, the grass grew up higher and higher\nuntil the baseball fields were merely imprints on my eyelids. The\nclouds moved more and more rapidly. I saw the sun curl across the sky\nlike a pop fly ti right, I saw it over and over. The firmament pulsed\nblue. And orange. And black. And yellow. Blue, and orange, and black,\nand yellow, blue and orange and black and yellow, faster and faster,\nflickering dark and light, flicker dark and light, a disorienting\nstrobing inside our passenger car.\n\n In\nthe millisecond darknesses I saw empty seats all around. In the\nmillisecond lightnesses, seated about me were all of my fellow Night\nVale citizens. These two realities simultaneous and overlaid.\n\n At\nthe front of the car, visible only in the rapid flashes of dark,\nstood a woman wearing a deer mask.\n\n She\nstared straight into me, walking slowly, stumbling every couple of\nsteps \xe2\x80\x93 not clumsily, but deliberately, a painful and grotesque\ndance. She seemed to lose control of her whole body, only to recover\ngracefully\xe2\x80\xa6and repeat.\n\n She\nstopped, inches from me. I could see her body was covered with\nroaches.\n\n She\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThey take our miniature buildings. They put them in crates,\nand deliver them to warehouses across the desert. Their interests are\nfurthered. It could not be more terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMiniature?\nLike, like the tiny nation of people under Lane 5 of the Bowling\nAlley and Arcade Fun Complex? Oh, did you know that they\xe2\x80\x99re reopening\nthe laser tag\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\ntook off her deer mask. Her actual face was the face of a deer. Her\nface and the mask were exactly the same.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWho\nare you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n She\nleaned in, insects scuttling across her long brown snout. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the\ndestroyer. They take our buildings. They put them in crates. Their\ninterests are furthered. I am the destroyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Strobing\nlight from the spinning sun stopped, and it was only dark now. No\nNight Vale. Even the deer-headed woman was gone. Around me, barely\nvisible in the dark train car was a sparse scattering of men dressed\nfrom a bygone era, holding wooden crates. They were sitting upright,\ntwisted around, and silently watching me.\n\n My\nface and chest itched. My scalp itched. I could feel a tickle along\nmy thighs. I reached to scratch\xe2\x80\xa6and I felt them. Felt them all. I\nscreamed and swatted them away, hundreds of roaches in my jeans, my\nshirt, my hair, I wa\xe2\x80\x93 I wanted to wretch but instead just writhed.\n\n And\nI felt the grass under me. I saw sunlight above me. I\xe2\x80\xa6I saw trees,\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice. I\xe2\x80\x93 I tasted nothing.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil?\nWhy are you in our field? You should be at work!\xe2\x80\x9d Lucia\nTereschenko, one of the Little League coaches (and also a ghost), was\nstanding over me, a group of kids in ball caps and jerseys behind\nher.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsorry\xe2\x80\xa6Lucia, I\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d I said, getting up, patting my chest, feeling\nfor insects. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see a train here just now, or\xe2\x80\xa6some men with\ncrates?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n There\nwas a long pause. Lucia looked like she wanted to either answer me or\nhit me.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCecil,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got something on you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n I\nreached my hand to my neck, and pulled back a roach.\n\n Lucia\nlooked closely at it.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\nWhat is this it says on the cockroach?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n We\nboth looked at the lettering across the roach\xe2\x80\x99s back.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHuntokhar,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwe read together.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCute\nname for a bug!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo go back to work, Cecil. We do\ninfield drills now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ncalled Carlos, but\xe2\x80\xa6he had no knowledge of the train or what\nhappened today. I called Sheriff Sam, who laughed at the notion, and\nthen complained about the media for fifteen minutes. I tried\ncontacting representatives from the Night Vale Transit Authority, but\ntheir line is busy (as it has been since they opened their offices\nthree years ago). I called Teddy Williams with some questions about\nthe tiny nation of people under Lane 5, but\xe2\x80\xa6he screamed and hung up\non me.\n\n I\nreached out to Wayne Ferry and confirmed the line of people on\nSomerset is totally\nreal,\nand they\xe2\x80\x99re all still waiting on whatever the line is for. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhear anything about a train.\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6I\nmust have dreamt it. The train, the woman in the deer mask, the men\nwith crates or\xe2\x80\xa6or\xe2\x80\xa6hallucinated?\n\n Maybe\nthe military was test marketing some new chemtrails. Or the Transit\nAuthority was test marketing a new imaginary train system. Who knows?\n\n Oh.\nUh, Kareem just brought me some lemon and honey tea. It smells\nreal, and it feels warm in my hand. Ugh. Oh! And hot on my lips! Uh,\nthank you for the tea, Kareem, and\xe2\x80\x93 and thank you for the realest\nthing I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt all day! [Chuckles]\n\n [Ahem]\nThe 12:37 train to parts unknown from\nparts unknown is gone, and like most everything else in our memories,\nit likely was never there to begin with, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Huntokhar.\nHuntokhar is real. Right?\n\n Kareem!\nHuntokhar is real! I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I saw it on a\xe2\x80\xa6a roach.\nLucia, the ghost who\xe2\x80\x93 who\xe2\x80\x93 who coaches Little League, she showed\nme!\n\n Kareem\nis shaking his head and backing out the studio. [Laughs\nnervously]\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to blink, Kareem!\n\n And\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the sound of a beating heart, a muffled sob, a nearby\nwhisper while you are supposedly\nalone in the dark, and all of your other favorite jams of the 1980s\nand '90s.\n\n And,\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Here is the church, here is the steeple. Open it up, and see\nall the people screaming about the giant that just tore the roof\nopen."
