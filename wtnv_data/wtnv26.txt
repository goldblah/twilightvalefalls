Episode 25 - One Year Later
b'A friendly desert community where the sun is still hot, the moon still beautiful, and mysterious lights still pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Word is in about a disturbance at the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex. There has been the sound of chanting and machinery from under the pin retrieval area of lane five, and Teddy Williams has changed all the bowlers\xe2\x80\x99 names on the electronic score cards to \xe2\x80\x9cThey Are Here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n This is causing some confusion, and has completely ruined Jeremy Godfried\xe2\x80\x99s 50th birthday party \xe2\x80\x93 which had rented out a few lanes for the afternoon. Jeremy was last seen drinking a light beer out of a plastic cup, shaking his head sadly as he swished the liquid around, and looking out the window at the sky (mostly void, partially stars).\n\n\n Teddy Williams was last seen howling, commanding his militia to surround the pin retrieval area and prepare for an attack.\n\n\n And Carlos \xe2\x80\x93 sweet Carlos, brave Carlos \xe2\x80\x93 was last seen approaching the entrance to the Underground City, saying he was going to get to the bottom of this, that someone had to, and that Teddy Williams was deranged.\n\n\n Teddy Williams was then last seen saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yeah? Oh yeah? Say that to my face, big shot!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But Carlos, my poor Carlos, was already gone.\n\n\n I fear, Night Vale. I fear for what we know. I fear for what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I fear for what we don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n\n\n The Apache Tracker stood outside of the bowling alley, glowering at the entrance and shaking his head. I remind you that this is the white guy who likes to dress in a cartoonish approximation of a Native American, and claims to have \xe2\x80\x9cmystical powers.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s a real racist jerk, and no one likes him. And the fact that he recently disappeared and reappeared as an actual Native American changes nothing. And neither does the fact that he can now only speak Russian. He is still the same embarrassment to our town he always was. Anyway, he\xe2\x80\x99s glowering at the entrance, arms crossed, wearing one of his stupid plastic feather headdresses.\n\n\n But\xe2\x80\xa6back to Carlos.\xc2\xa0Carlos the Scientist. Perfect of stature and bearing, perfect of tone and taut, and time having fixed what the barbarous barber Telly so treacherously snipped away, perfect of hair.\n\n\n One year. One year later. Listeners. Listeners! One single year since two major events in our town\xe2\x80\x99s history.\n\n\n First, the opening of our lovely state-of-the-art Dog Park (which is forbidden, and which I will not mention again).\n\n\n Second, and most important, it is one year since the arrival in Night Vale of our most beloved and singular citizen. He came to us to investigate our town. Because, he said, it was scientifically extraordinary, and downright bizarre. We had no idea what he was talking about, but with his golden voice ringing out from the bell of his mouth, who among us could argue with the content of such perfect speech?\n\n\n Oh, just one short year ago.\n\n\n I had arranged a small ceremony to mark this occasion, and invited Carlos to attend. However, it looks like he will be\xe2\x80\xa6delayed.\n\n\n But I am not worried. I am not upset. I know that Carlos will be here for the ceremony. I have the trophy here in my hand. I am holding the trophy and I am not upset. Carlos will be here. He will. I am holding the trophy!\n\n\n In other news, a commercial airliner appeared today inside the home of surprised Night Vale citizen Becky Canterbury, who said she was about to get into the shower when it roared down her hallway and then disappeared, as suddenly as it had arrived. There is no conclusive evidence that this is the same airliner last seen in the Night Vale Elementary gym one year ago. But we have jumped to that conclusion and will defend it against all naysayers, violently and without mercy.\n\n\n Our truths may or may not be true, but they are ours, and we stand by them \xe2\x80\x93 even as the experts and skeptics hold aloft clipboards and intone to us about \xe2\x80\x9csnow\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Becky added that she would like to take that shower now, and that she has no idea how we managed to arrive for an interview mere seconds after the incident occurred.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMy doors are locked!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy windows too! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my eyes shut for years! How did you get in here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The local chapter of the NRA has begun market-testing some possible new slogans. These include:\n\n\n \n Guns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, blood loss and organ damage does\n\n\n Guns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, people kill guns\n\n\n A list of things that kill people: 1. Conceivably, anything 2. Not guns!\n\n\n Guns don\xe2\x80\x99t kill people, we are all immortal souls living temporarily in shelters of earth and meat\n\n\n\n And,\n\n\n \n If you say guns kill people one more time, I will shoot you with a gun, and you will, coincidentally, die\n\n\n\n To vote on the new slogan, simply fire a gun at the object or person that best represents your choice.\n\n\n Parents, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about safety when taking your children to play out in the Scrublands and the Sand Wastes. All children in Night Vale are missing this week, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no current safety issues.\n\n\n Hope we find \xe2\x80\x98em!\n\n\n Oh happy day! I have just received word that Carlos returned from the entrance to the city, gesturing to everyone around and asking them to follow him. He lead them into the pin retrieval area, which is not an easy place for a crowd, so there was a lot of crouching and saying \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me. Excuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But soon enough, they were all arrayed on the clifftop, overlooking that dreaded subterranean metropolis. Teddy Williams, and his militia, and the folks that had come for Jeremy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, and Jeremy himself \xe2\x80\x93 still holding his plastic cup of beer and leaning morosely against the wall, pointedly refusing to look where everyone else was.\n\n\n This was the first time most of them had seen the city. It seemed so distant below them, its strange spires small and far away. The windows in the buildings, alight with the fire of hostile life, were tiny dots from where they stood. They could hear the footsteps of the approaching army, the chanting!\n\n\n Many of them quaked with fear, but not Carlos. My brave Carlos stepped out into the pit, climbing down the slope. At first, onlookers were horrified at his lunatic descent. Then, they were confused\xe2\x80\xa6as he got to the city much faster than they expected. And then, there was panic, as their eyes told them a story they could not understand, let alone believe.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBehold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlos, standing in the center of the Underground City, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not an enormous city miles below the earth. It is a very small city about ten feet below the earth, populated by tiny people, who have had to spend a year slowly climbing the ten feet to our world!'
