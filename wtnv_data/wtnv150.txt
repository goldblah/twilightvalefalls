128 - A Matter of Blood, Part 2
b'As a matter of fact, the facts don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Listeners, it is upon us. Yes, today is the day of the blood matter from space. That extremely rare cosmological event we are all so lucky to witness. And the astronomers tell us that this is going to be a big one. \xe2\x80\x9cAAAAAAAAAAA!\xe2\x80\x9d the astronomers screamed from the observatory up on Cactus Hill. The astronomers gestured up at the sky with gaping eyes and lolling mouths. \xe2\x80\x9cOh god, oh god, OH GOD!\xe2\x80\x9d they added. \n\n Here at the station, Carlos and I are throwing a little viewing party. Lots of folks from town are in attendance, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re listening, consider yourself invited. Just bring a potluck item and a friendly face, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the rest. I would head over soon though, because of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna be caught outside during the blood matter from space.\n\n Pamela Winchell is here, lugging around her emergency press conference kit. She\xe2\x80\x99s very excited and she anticipates a need for a number of emergency press conferences today. She also brought vegetarian sushi, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve scarfed down like six of those suckers. Susan Willman only brought a plastic box of store-brand chocolate chip cookies with the price tag still attached. OK, Susan. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna be down on anybody, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\n\n She then decided to be rude about the scones that Steve Carlsberg brought, and sure my brother Steve\xe2\x80\x99s scones might be a little drier than some prefer, and maybe could use a tablespoon or three less salt. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the love that is put into a food delicious, and no one holds more love in his heart than Steve. So quit ragging on him, Susan!\n\n One conspicuous absence from our party today is our Mayor, Dana Cardinal. She is still wanted for murder. Both of her. There now appears to be two Danas. One version of herself, the one that I have known for years, is hiding and no one has any idea at all of her location. She could be anywhere, and she is probably impossible to find. The other Dana, the one who is a stranger to us, is out in the open. She is highly dangerous. All who have approached her to attempt an apprehension have run away injured or dead. Do you have any idea how painful it is to run while dead? Stay clear of her! More on this situation, and on the great party we have going on here, soon. \n\n Dana: I still believe in this town and in its people. There is good here. So much good, and I mean to expand on that good and fight like hell against anyone endangering it. But for now, I must do that from an undisclosed location. My hosts at this secure and secret spot have been very sweet about the situation, even though their house only has one bathroom. \n\n Fortunately, my arrival did help settle a long-standing argument as one of my hosts had wanted to turn the guestroom into a home lab, and the other wanted to turn it into a home broadcast studio, but since I needed a place to sleep, for now the guestroom will remain a guestroom. Do not come looking for me. I could be anywhere and you would never find me. \n\n This situation, in which there is another version of me, hunting me, apparently looking to kill me \xe2\x80\x93 this is a distraction. What I did the last time I met my double, that is also a distraction. I can only look to the future, move to the future, and leave behind any choices I made in the past. Today my new mayoral powers will become active.\xc2\xa0\n\n I understand concerns about the vast amount of personal information and power that will pass through my office, but I can only tell you that I mean the absolute best for this town. I love this place! And I would never abuse the power I have seized. \n\n Other Dana: [voice echoing] What a pitiful town. What a pitiful world. I ache for home. Here they mule and they scramble. They die so easily. I wish anyone would put up the fight that I deserve. I would still tear them asunder, but oh to feel some fear before I kill! Just once. But I am not here for that kind of satisfaction. I seek a deeper justice. \n\n A man in an official uniform steps up to me. He\xe2\x80\x99s sweating and pale and glancing back at a line of men in suits watching with crossed arms. One of the men in suits nods at the man in front of me and gestures forward. \xe2\x80\x9cUuhhhh,\xe2\x80\x9d this sweating man says. I say nothing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cUhhhh,\xe2\x80\x9d he says again. \xe2\x80\x9cE-e-excuse me but uhhh, e-eh but it seems you\xe2\x80\x99re under arrest so\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Finally, I turn. He blanches. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a message for your superiors,\xe2\x80\x9d I tell him. \xe2\x80\x9cUhhh, o-oh,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cW-what is it, I can tell them for you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry,\xe2\x80\x9d I say gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them myself right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I cut his throat. He looks so surprised. He was afraid but never expected his fears to be fulfilled. Weakness! Ugh, pathetic. I maintain eye contact with the men in suits while the man before he whimpers away into the dirt. Once he is finally quiet, I turn and leave. \n\n What a pitiful town! What a pitiful world! I ache for home.\n\n Cecil: The viewing party for the blood matter from space is in full swing, and we\xe2\x80\x99re all having a blast here. Pamela Winchell has had a good deal of spiked eggnog, and is now having people shout out topics for emergency press conferences, and then improvising the press conference based on that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun and also very loud and monopolizing the party a little, but that\xe2\x80\x99s OK. Carlos is explaining some of the science behind the blood matter from space but the truth is, we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that much about what it is or why it happens, and so his presentation contains more question marks and \xe2\x80\x9cfacts to be filled in later\xe2\x80\x9d labels than usual. But it is OK sometimes to find something beautiful without fully understanding it. And it is undeniable that under certain aesthetic values and with a strong ability to stomach gore, the blood matter from space could be considered beautiful.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve just checked in uh, the guest Carlos and I have at the house and she\xe2\x80\x99s doing fine. No one any of you would know, uh uh a cousin of Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 from Canada. She\xe2\x80\x99s doing great and feels secure that no one will find her in our guestroom.\n\n Meanwhile, Station Management has emerged, terrifyingly, from its office. And has gone outside, where it is standing in the street with its many mouths aimed at the sky, presumably waiting for the blood matter to ascend. To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Station Management ate.\n\n Dana: Others are being hurt on my behalf, and here I hide. What a terrible feeling! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone hurt, and certainly not because of me. And certainly not because of my cowardice. But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about me or my pride. This new regime of centralized mayoral power is about the greater good, and so I must keep the greater good in mind. \n\n Even if it disgraces me as a person, I must stay in hiding and work. Already I have received much useful information due to my authorized access to the Vague yet Menacing Government Agency\xe2\x80\x99s database. And I am using that information to better coordinate city services. And also to stop 8 entirely separate doomsday cults who were independently planning on attacking the city. Um, we have a lot of cults here. Who knew? \n\n So I will have to see the greater good and continue staying in this undisclosed, secure location. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not about me. It\xe2\x80\x99s no- [phone ringtone] Uh, hold on. Hello? Yeah. What? WHAT?! No, no please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there. I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there!\n\n Other Dana: If I cannot find my weakling other, then I will make her come crawling to me. So that is why I am in this house. The older woman and the young man, they stare at me with wide eyes. The older woman says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d and I tell her, I explain to her why, and she is silent and horrified, because she cannot deny the righteousness of my cause. And then I cut her left pinkie off, and she starts going into that whole \xe2\x80\x9cwhy?\xe2\x80\x9d thing again, and I tell her that I just explained to her why, and if she\xe2\x80\x99s asking why specifically I needed to remove her pinkie, it\xe2\x80\x99s because I needed to make clear the seriousness of my purpose. That I neither wish to cause harm or wish to avoid harm. I will cause harm as needed, to the degree it is needed. I tell her that next I will kill the young man, because it is my judgment that this order of operations would cause the most impact, and lead to the fulfillment of my mission here. But she isn\xe2\x80\x99t listening. She is (-) [0:12:38] at her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hardly would have used that finger anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d I tell her, and I got to the window to wait for my double. \n\n If the possible murder of her mother and brother in her own childhood home does not make her come to me, then I have severely misjudged myself.\n\n Cecil: Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting reports that the situation with Dana has taken an alarming and imminently tragic turn. But before we get into more of this,\xc2\xa0let\xe2\x80\x99s do a quick check on the weather.\xc2\xa0\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cLemonade in the Shade\xe2\x80\x9d by Jeff Scroggins &amp; Colorado, http://jeffscrogginsandcolorado.com/]\n\n Other Dana: You may judge me evil. You may judge me heartless. You may judge me however you like. That is your burden.\n\n Here is my burden. I am Dana, as much so as that other woman. We are both ourselves completely. We simply lived in different versions of our world, and so grew to become different people. This is as natural as water freezing to ice, as seeds growing to trees. It\xe2\x80\x99s just less noticeable to us, since it takes place on an axis of space and time not visible to the average human. But I did not have the luxury of disregarding it, because once upon a time, in this world, some people met themselves as a result of a certain interdimensional confusion inherent to this location. This was neither a mistake nor a disaster, nor a blessing. It was just a random act of nature, no different from the sandstorm that accompanied it. \n\n But Dana. This Dana you cherish as your Mayor. She met herself and she committed murder. She killed one of us. One of the Danas. And we all felt it. To murder your own blood, to kill a you from another timeline, that is an unthinkable crime. So other Danas, we got together and we discussed what had happened, and it was clear to us that our sister who was also us, she must stand accountable for her crime. I was the most able and warlike of all of us, having been raised in a universe in which those skills were necessary. So I was chosen to come and to make our sister responsible for her actions all those years ago. I have been searching for her a long time. You think I wanted this? You think I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy this Dana, with her friends, with her town, with her goodwill toward others? \n\n I did not seek vengeance. She brought this vengeance to me, and so it is my sad lot to carry it out until the end. Until I can force me to face myself.\n\n Dana: I killed my double. Or I am the double who killed the original. I have no way of knowing which, and that guilt has stuck with me ever since. It seemed to me that if I were the one who survived, then I must make that survival worthwhile by doing good to our town. But I cannot ignore my family. And so I go. I am on my way to my family\xe2\x80\x99s house. Before I go, I am finalizing the transfer of power to the mayoral office. It is done. The changes to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s power are fully in effect. Of course, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much longer I will be in effect. So let these changes stand as my legacy. No more running. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to face myself. \n\n Cecil: Listeners. Uh from the viewing party at the community radio station, uh I have some serious news to tell you. Which is why I\xe2\x80\x99ve locked myself in this supply closet where I can get, you know, a little quiet to record with. Come on, Pamela, please! Please keep it down, Pamela! \n\n OK, I must report that the mayoral program has gone into effect. As of now, all surveillance and enforcement power in this town is run directly through the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office. [rain-like sound] May the distant lights that guide us from the upper stratosphere be with our Mayor and with our citizens. And, oh my god, oh my god listeners, the-the blood matter from space, it\xe2\x80\x99s here! It has arrived!\n\n Oh god, it\xe2\x80\x99s here!\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Our money back guarantee: when you die, the world gets your money back.'
