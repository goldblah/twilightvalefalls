Episode 98 - Flight
b'Those who remember history are also doomed to repeat it. Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Despite the best efforts of Hadassah McDaniels and her team of five-headed dragon lawyers, her brother, Hiram McDaniels, is scheduled to be executed today for his crimes against state and city. City government promises that by the end of this broadcast, Hiram McDaniels will be dead. Well. Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s executioner, Dale Salazar, has once again been raised from the graveyard. When asked for a comment, Dale coughed through disused vocal cords for a while before finding his soft voice, not used since the last public execution more than three decades ago. Secret executions are much more common. [hoarsely] \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to provide a quick and humane death,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it has to happen, and I\xe2\x80\x99m told it does, then I will have it happen with as much mercy as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d He then lowered his canvas executioner\xe2\x80\x99s hood, painted with a screaming monster face, and began marking his chest with the ritual signs of the blood stone circle. \n\n Hadassah and her lawyer, Miriam, were fuming - literally breathing fumes of fire, in their anger about Mayor Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s complete refusal to budge on the issue of the execution of Hadassah\xe2\x80\x99s brother. \xe2\x80\x9cHiram is a citizen of our world, not yours,\xe2\x80\x9d Miriam said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo inflict on him the justice of mere humanity is a crime against not just one dragon, but all dragons everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d Hadassah added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you touch one head on my brother\xe2\x80\x99s five necks, I will end you and your puny world.\xe2\x80\x9d Hiram himself has showed no worry about his forthcoming departure from our plane of existence. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just say I don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to be around when they want to make it so I\xe2\x80\x99m not around,\xe2\x80\x9d his Gold Head said, and then his Gold Head winked, and his Violet Head rolled his eyes about the wink. \xe2\x80\x9cWalls cannot hold us!\xe2\x80\x9d roared his Green Head. \xe2\x80\x9cOr they can, up to now, but they will not for much longer!\xe2\x80\x9d It seems despite the news of his escape plans being, um, accidentally broadcast on the radio recently, Hiram is confident they will continue without a hitch, due to his careful planning and the help of an unnamed accomplice. Who he would only say was \xe2\x80\x9cquite old\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely faceless\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n Hiram has worked his way out of more difficult situations, and so my worry isn\xe2\x80\x99t with him, but with Old Woman Josie. Her broken hip has led to an infection, and she has been mostly confined to her bed for the past couple weeks. She was not able to come to league night at all, and I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about her ability to bowl ever again. Her friend Sarah Sultan took her place on our bowling team last week and was a surprisingly good bowler\xe2\x80\xa6 but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same without Josie. She continues to be positive about it and says that it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those things, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out and about in no time, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \n\n Well. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated about Hiram as the day moves on, but in the meantime, I will move on to the news. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s fine with the water,\xe2\x80\x9d came an unprompted announcement from \xc2\xa0officials. The officials emphasized that despite what you may have heard, the water is safe to drink and even to let touch your skin in moderate quantities and for a limited period of time. The officials dipped their gloved hands into the water and brought the water up to their mouths. \xe2\x80\x9cMmmmm!!\xe2\x80\x9d the officials said, clearly letting the water splash out of their hands without ever getting near their clamped shut mouths. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at us, drinking this delicious, clean water! Definitely it is safe and normal water and there is no need for testing, or even look at it too closely.\xe2\x80\x9d The officials then disposed of the gloves and retired from the press conference without asking questions, citing their need for an immediate chemical shower. Lieutenant Regis of Unit 7 of the Local National Guard Station and KFC Combo Store said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised at all. Something like this had been due to happen, and it was only a matter of time. \xe2\x80\x9cMost everything\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe exist in it, time. And space,\xe2\x80\x9d he added thoughtfully, then snorted and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course space is just the physical aspect of time, in the same way that meat is the physical aspect of sentience.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed at his joke, although it was not clear to anyone else what the joke was, or even which part of what he had said had been the joke. The lieutenant was burying himself in the Sand Wastes, until he was covered to the hips, just a torso sticking out of the sand. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for reaching out again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9calways nice to talk to old friends!\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled, made finger guns at a passing cloud, and began beautifully to sing. This has been the news. \n\n The countdown continues to the planned time of Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s death. Dale Salazar has completed his blood stone rituals and is now doing some preparatory stretching and light aerobics. He explained, [hoarsely] \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important that your body be literally warmed up in order to prevent injury. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want any injuries, except obviously the fatal ones I will be inflicting, but no cramps or torn muscles, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Cardinal watched in solemn silence as everything was made ready for the death of her attempted murderers, four out of five of the heads of Hiram McDaniels. The only one not sentenced is the Violet Head. But in a statement, Violet shouted repeatedly from Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s Prison Cell: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are different heads, but a single being! We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will happen to me if the other heads die, this is murder! Murder!!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a follow-up statement from Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s Green Head saying: \xe2\x80\x9cStop mulling and help us with the wall!!\xe2\x80\x9d Then Gray issued a statement saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWell now you\xe2\x80\x99ve told them about the wall, it\xe2\x80\x99s all ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d And Gold issued a final statement saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHe just meant folks, help us examine how impenetrable and secure this wall is. No one could ever escape from here, no matter how many extremely clever heads he has.\xe2\x80\x9d Later, Hiram was seen wandering the exercise yard, casually leaving a trail of dirt and pebbles behind him as he walked. Meanwhile, Hadassah and her fellow dragons have been moved to a designed Free Speech Cage, which is heavily reinforced and electrified for the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 protection. They will remain in the Free Speech Cage until they stop breathing so much fire at people. \n\n And in news I cannot help but focus on.. Josie has been feeling, uh, lethargic all day. The Erikas, whom she insists I call angels despite how.. deeply illegal it is and how that could get me in a good deal of trouble, are all standing out in her yard, their heads bowed, moaning low and crying. Which isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good sign, obviously. I-I-I-I\xe2\x80\x99m worried about Hiram of course, and I\xe2\x80\x99m also worried about Josie. I am worried about my friend. \n\n And now a station editorial. There has been much talk lately about the dangers of dreams. And yes, we concede, it seems like madness that our brains force us to experience apparent realities we have no control over, and that are often confusing and frightening. We could be spending that time in our own reality that we have no control over, and that is often confusing and frightening. While the recreational use of dreams is understandable in moderation, dream advocates don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop there. There are reports of dreams being given to young children or even babies. That said, we also cannot get behind the current push to band dreams altogether. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have, of course, seen the flyers and posters pointing out alarming statistics, such as that three in five dreamers do not even own a properly registered dream journal, and that there is currently a loophole where anyone who sleeps can just have a dream, without going through any kind of background check. But dreaming is our right. It is a foolish right, one that was instituted by people living in a different time, and with little thought as to the ramifications through history of their incomplete grasp of the world, but a right nonetheless. If dreams are criminalized, then only criminals will have dreams. For this reason, dreams should not be banned.\xc2\xa0\n\n But we do believe there needs to be common sense restrictions on dreaming, such as banning the more powerful and dangerous forms of dreams, like night terrors and daydreaming. And requiring all citizens to report their dreams to specifically programmed satellites that will take those dreams and carry them whizzing around the Earth. Some day when all of us humans are gone, the satellites will continue to whirr in the cold vacuum above, carrying the dreams of the long dead. And in that way, with their tiny mechanical bodies, we will live on. This has been a station editorial.\n\n And now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner. Please use the materials we sent you to follow along at home. The first thing you\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to do is make an incision just above the main artery. You see the pulsing thing? Right, so put a finger on that, and then cut just above your finger. Great! Now there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some oozing, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t there always some oozing, kids? Oozing is natural, it\xe2\x80\x99s what separates us from the machines. Oh, speaking of machines, now is when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use those wires we sent. Insert them in the incision. Mm hmm. Oh, very good. If you\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble getting them in there, just push really hard. OK, now ask your parents to help you with this next bit, as it could be a little dangerous. Once you have pushed the wires allll the way into your heart cavity, you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to need to get any normal household car battery and attach the wires to that. Following the experiment, you might have some side effects like a general movement outwards, a sagging of the insides, or joust jaw. If you experience any of these, please do let us know, as that data is helpful to us. This has been your Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n We have reached it, listeners, the time scheduled for Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s execution. The guards walk down the corridor to retrieve him. Dale Salazar hops up and down and makes a series of soft grunts. His municipal executioner\xe2\x80\x99s rifle held high above his head. The Mayor still stands in determined silence. Hadassah hisses at the electrified bars of her cage.\xc2\xa0\n\n The door is opened and.. Hiram isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. Instead, there is only a hole in the wall. Yes, listeners, it appears that Hiram has been digging a hole in his wall, hiding it behind the poster of a hole in the wall that has been hanging in his cell this entire time. The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home was clearly able to smuggle him some simple tools, since the prison cell was technically his home and so, according to to the rules of her existence, she was already inside of it, secretly living there. He used these tools, like a jackhammer and scaffolding and several meters of tunnel lighting and a generator, to slip out of Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, just as his time had come. What a clever dragon! The guards rushed to the window to see him winging his way up into the searing blue sky, truly free for the first time in over a year, flexing muscles that have not seen use during his captivity. Green howls with joy. Blue and Gold, caught up in the moment, join him. All of us in Night Vale follow this escape with rapt attention. I-I-I think I can see him from my studio right now. Even Josie at home in her bed, weak but still awake, listens to Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s escape and feels in his flight some sense of rising, some sense of the possibility of escape for us all.\xc2\xa0\n\n Hiram is a criminal, but in this moment, he is also a kinetic monument to joyous animal freedom and.. [music distorts, slows down ] Oh.. Oh, I.. Um..\n\n [weak voice] We take you now to the weather. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cIcarus\xe2\x80\x9d by Sims]\n\n We all know what happened. We all\xe2\x80\xa6 Night Vale, there has been a death. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start there. Just start with the fact of it and\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m still in shock, so\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, uh, this won\xe2\x80\x99t be up to the strict, neutral journalistic quality you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect from me I\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m I-I\xe2\x80\x99m just so shocked, I\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n There has been a death. One who was once living is not. It happened during Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s escape, he rouse into the air and our hearts rouse with him, and I listened from my booth. In her bed, Josie listened too. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe are free!!\xe2\x80\x9d Green roared. \xe2\x80\x9cNo cell can contain me!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the least sad I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever felt,\xe2\x80\x9d Gray said. \xe2\x80\x9cPhysics is merely a mathematical expression of the joy of movement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blue. \xe2\x80\x9cI was against this from the start!\xe2\x80\x9d said Violet. Then he conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was wrong! Higher! Let\xe2\x80\x99s fly higher!\xe2\x80\x9d and Violet laughed. Hadassah and Miriam roared in joy. Mayor Cardinal tightened her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him run,\xe2\x80\x9d the Mayor said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will find him again.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n But Dale Salazar wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in that. He had been raised from the grave to do a job, and he did not let simple things like escape get in the way of that job. He began jogging underneath the flying dragon, saying \xe2\x80\x9chop, hop,\xe2\x80\x9d as he ran. He could not keep up with the power of the dragon\xe2\x80\x99s wings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s OK,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Mayor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone, Dale, it\xe2\x80\x99s OK.\xe2\x80\x9d But Dale did not hear. Dale Salazar began to fire at the escaping dragon. \xe2\x80\x9cNo you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed. His mask had fallen off during his running, and his face was red, his eyes were wide, he fired at Hiram. \xe2\x80\x9cNo you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed again. \xe2\x80\x9cYour bullets are useless against me!\xe2\x80\x9d Green said, and they were useless against him. They missed Green completely. \n\n It was Violet who was hit, the bullet entering just beneath his jawline. It only took one shot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Violet suffered at all. On the downstroke of a wing, Violet was alived and united with the four other heads that made up the whole of Hiram, and on the upstroke.. Violet was dead. And the other heads reeled at the loss of a part of themselves. There was a gap in their being that they had never experienced, should never have experienced. Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s body faltered, suddenly clumsy, regaining only some semblance of flight. The rest of him continued on, the dead Violet swinging below. Mayor Cardinal shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d but only after what was done, was done. The \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d was not a command but a regret. She opened her mouth. She closed her mouth. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. She said nothing about situational irony. She said nothing about unnecessary tragedy. She said nothing more about anything. Hadassah screamed in impotent rage and despair. She clawed over and over at the bars of the cage, powerful electric shocks ran through her, but she felt none of them. She clawed and clawed, howling with a voice even she did not recognize. \n\n At home, Old Woman Josie put her hands over her face. She felt a plunging inside. And it was this sorrow that gave her the energy to slowly get out of bed, to hobble out into the front yard and join the Erikas. She put her arms around them. They surrounded her in a deep, glowing blackness, and together they shared their surprise and their grief. \n\n Dale Salazar, job more or less done or at least someone killed, returned satisfied to his grave, buried again until the next public execution is needed. \n\n And I\xe2\x80\xa6 sit here, in front of my microphone making.. useless sounds with my useless mouth. Discovering the weightlessness of stories before the heavy weight of the world. \n\n Stay tuned next for\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\n\n Good night. [the sound of a mic dropping, a door closing]\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: So there\xe2\x80\x99s this commercial and it\xe2\x80\x99s like there\xe2\x80\x99s this baby and she\xe2\x80\x99s not getting along with the dog, she\xe2\x80\x99s like a little afraid of the dog and the dog is like a big a beautiful Golden Retriever and um, so like the Golden Retriever like feels sad coz he can\xe2\x80\x99t be with his family because the baby doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him, but so the Dad sees that um, the baby likes the the um, stuffed animal that she has which is a lion, so the Dad goes and orders a lion mane for the dog and then he puts it, he puts it on the dog and the dog, um the dog walks in as the lion and the baby loves it and the dog is happy coz it can be a part of the family again, as a as a lion. Thank you.'
