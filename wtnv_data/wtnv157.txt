134 - Fall Football Preview
b'There is no I in \xe2\x80\x9cteam\xe2\x80\x9d. This has been a partial list of letters not found in the word \xe2\x80\x9cteam\xe2\x80\x9d. Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n The Night Vale High School Scorpions kick-off the varsity football season this Friday against last year\xe2\x80\x99s district champion, Red Mesa. Following the announcement this summer that Scorpions\xe2\x80\x99 head coach, Nazr al-Mujaheed, would be taking a sabbatical to deal with personal matters, Night Vale promoted defensive coordinator Lutrice Beaumont to head coach. She has ten years coaching experience and was a former line backer for the Scorpions during their heyday as four time state champs in the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s. This is a historical hire for the high school football program, as Lutrice Beaumont is the first Gemini to become head coach. Beaumont called a press conference this morning to talk about her team and her coaching staff\xe2\x80\x99s expectations for this season. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter only one win last year,\xe2\x80\x9d Beaumont explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwe wanted to change our approach entirely. Instead of a plotting, run-focused offensive, we want our starting quarterback, sophomore Junius Duncan, to really throw that ball around, just chuck that leather (wad) any direction he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s team motto for 2018 is \xe2\x80\x9cwe will win, all the time, right now\xe2\x80\x9d. Junius Duncan has a small frame at only 5\xe2\x80\x994\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and 120 pounds. But he has eight legs and can leap up to 20 times his own height. He has struggled with his accuracy in training camp, as he has zero arms. And the spiny tips of his front legs cause the ball to stick and sometimes deflate. \n\n Senior running back Prince Reynolds, who led the district in rushing last year, returns in full health. Coach Beaumont said Reynolds has been working on his upper body strength in the off-season by installing hydraulic joints on each shoulder. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on the upcoming Scorpion football season in a moment. But first, a look at traffic.\n\n Lisa Farmer does not like her job. She does not hate it, either. To Lisa, a job is a paid dare to sit in a chair for 10 hours every weekday for 40 years, for a little over a million dollars, paid out in bi-weekly installments. She commutes 35 minutes each way to her office. During this time, she thinks about the divorce papers her attorney gave her, but that she\xe2\x80\x99s never filled out. She thinks about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lack of motivation. She thinks about having children. Not whether to have them, but the actual process of birth. She sometimes offers up an involuntary laugh, a reflex response to the forced laughter of the FM drivetime talk show. She forgets all of this when she arrives at home or work. Time pours from her like water from a broken pipe. All this time, lost to unmemorable travel. She measures her life in traffic jams, a mathematical equation that proves nothing. Commutes are the limbo of the weekday. Everything is stasis. Expect delays. This has been traffic. \n\n In her opening press conference, Night Vale Scorpions\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa0head coach Lutrice Beaumont said there were some rule changes this season that will affect her team\xe2\x80\x99s approach. First, helmet to helmet hits, normally assigned a personal foul penalty, will now be subject to game (ejections) and possible suspensions. Officials are also cracking down on end zone celebrations. Many fans felt the elaborate displays of joy exhibited by players last season were not in the spirit of good sportsmanship. The most egregious example was when Cactus Park\xe2\x80\x99s Jamille Whiteside scored the game-winning touchdown against Pine Cliff. He and the rest of his team mates then performed in the end zone the entirety of the Tony-winning musical sensation \xe2\x80\x9cWicked\xe2\x80\x9d. District head of officiating, Jake Camp, announced: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired of selfish kids making a team sport all about them. In my day, when we scored, we would calmly hand the ball to the ref and jog back to the sideline head down. Maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, uh, a more religious kid might offer a quick prayer to the Brown Stone Spire, an unobtrusive gesture of kneeling, cutting your finger open, drawing a nine-pointed star with your blood, as your team mates danced about shirtless and chanting something in ancient\xc2\xa0Akkadian or Greek, but nothing ostentatious like what kids these days do. Did you see that one kid who did a backflip? [angrily] A backflip! This is football, not Cirque du Soleil, son!\xe2\x80\x9d Camp shouted. He added that millennials are killing everything good in the world. \n\n One reporter reported that current high schoolers are not even part of the millennial generation. Another reporter pointed out that Camp is 33 years old, which makes him a millennial. Camp paused and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanna be like that? Fine!\xe2\x80\x9d Camp then begun to grunt and strain, his face darkened to a deep violet, as long white hair gushed from the top of his head and out of his chin. His posture weakened, his back now hunched. Wrinkles formed around his eyes and lips, and his skin loosened. He then said hoarsely: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 93 now. So you know where you can put that millennial comment of yours!\xe2\x80\x9d The reporter assumed Camp meant the sport section of the newspaper, so that\xe2\x80\x99s where the reporter put it. \n\n In the middle of Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s press conference, assistant coach Christopher Tisdale whispered into her ear and she frowned. When asked to elaborate, she said she\xe2\x80\x99d just received word that another new rule is that all players must have two or fewer legs. Which prohibits her starting quarterback, Junius Duncan from taking the field. Upset by this sudden change, Beaumont cited the Golden Retriever who was allowed to play basketball for Cactus Park back in 1997. They named the dog Airbud, because the dog was the former CEO of an airline. Admittedly, the dog was terrible at basketball. He ran in circles and barked at the coach for treats, while opposing teams took huge advantage of the five-on-four mismatch. But according to Beaumont, a precedent was set for multi-legged players.\n\n Oh, this is terrible news. Junius must be devastated. Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s press conference is still going on. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to it soon.\n\n But for now, when the first bolt of lightning struck the sea, and the first apex of rock crested the tumultuous oceans, the elders among the stars brought life onto the Earth. These children of stardust became humans, became authorities of their tiny planet. They created science and art, and they worshipped their galactic forebearers. But their hubris grew in them like a cancer, and they abandoned the benevolence of their creators. The vigilant determination of life leads only \xe2\x80\x93 to death. An ironic ouroboros to be laughed at by the elders of the cosmos. Diet Pepsi. Humans are a knock-knock joke of the gods.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look now at Night Vale High School\xe2\x80\x99s district rivals this season, starting with last year\xe2\x80\x99s champs, the Red Mesa Ant Carpenters. Red Mesa returns their starting quarterback, senior Salman Talib, who leads a dynamic passing offense anchored by junior wide receiver, Trung Pham. Pham\xe2\x80\x99s quick feet, 6\xe2\x80\x995\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 frame, and nearly 20-inch antlers allow him to break free from smaller defenders. \xc2\xa0The Pine Cliff Lizard Monitors return with the league\xe2\x80\x99s top offence. Everyone in Pine Cliff is a ghost, making them quite elusive, but the flip side of that is that their defence is terrible. In terms of total tackles made last season, they finished dead last. Pun not intended. But pun certainly embraced, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad. Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 Aha? A-ha. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word from my producer Ian that is in fact a bad pun, in bad taste. Ian\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother was part of the Great Cataclysm of 2008, which turned all of Pine Cliff into ghosts. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s no laughing matter to those living in Pine Cliff. To-to those residing in Pine Cliff, so. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to the part where I said pun not intended.\n\n One team to watch out for this year is the Cactus Park Shark Nurses, who have a strong defence but who have struggled with turnovers. The Shark Nurses\xe2\x80\x99 senior running back Patrick Lyle had 20 fumbles last year, but said he focused on his ball carrying technique in the off season. Coachers worked with Lyle to carry the ball high and tight against his shoulder pads, instead of in his cargo shorts\xe2\x80\x99 pockets. \n\n Desert Bluffs, which has not had a team nor a high school for the past three seasons, has reincorporated in some desert otherworld and will be returning to district to play this year. League officials are concerned about the capriciousness of gateways between our reality and theirs, which could lead to visiting teams becoming lost in either a time loop or disappearing altogether. Theoretical physicist Cedric Dummond from Desert Bluffs Junior College said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you only focus on the bad, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see the good!\xe2\x80\x9d Not much is known about this Vultures team other than they\xe2\x80\x99re probably \xe2\x80\x93 terrible. \n\n Finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s another new district rival this season, the Whispering Forest High School Wood Dogs. Whispering Forest High opened in 2016 after the forest incorporated as an independent township. No humans live in the Whispering Forest, only trees. Really polite trees, always with a quiet compliment. But if you accept one of their compliments, you too become a tree in their forest. Fun fact: Whispering Forest is the fastest growing town here in the desert. Urban planning experts think that the positivity emanating from the Whispering Forest has been a real draw for people seeking new homes. They\xe2\x80\x99re unable to determine why a need for positivity suddenly became a factor in like 2016, but there it is. The Wood Dogs are sure to be the largest and toughest opponent in Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s distrct, but also the slowest, as they are literally trees. Their real strength won\xe2\x80\x99t be in their ability to score or sack the quarterback, but to recruit entire opposing teams to their side before the game ends. \n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s a look at Night Vale High\xe2\x80\x99s rivals this year. Coming up, we\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with coach Beaumont and her team strategy for 2018. But first, a public service announcement. \n\n Friends of the Night Vale Public Library announced the annual used book sale is this Saturday afternoon from 10 to 5. Librarians will hang books from invisible twine attached to blade-based traps, inside a complex cornfield labyrinth. According to the press release, which appears to be written by a detached human finger dipped in its own blood, these are\xe2\x80\xa6 [clears throat] great books by great authors like Georg \xc2\xa0Saunders, Mohsin Hamid, and Celeste Ng. Books you really should read. Books you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to reach out and grab, without noticing that the earth below you is lightly covered in branches hiding a spike-filled pit. So come down to the library for the used book sale. No need to shower beforehand, your natural scent makes you easier to track. This has been a public service announcement. \n\n Coach Beaumont has finally completed her pre-season press conference, and she finished it off with quite a statement. When asked what the overall strategy for this year would be, Beaumont said: \xe2\x80\x9cSurpriiise!\xe2\x80\x9d But she said it just like that, with her eyes wide and arms raised and there was a looong silence as the reporters waited for what was to happen next. The energy faded as Beaumont slowly lowered her hands, a lone cough came from the back of the room. Beaumont then continued: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, our strategy is surprise. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want our opponents to have any time to prepare for us, so we scheduled every single game simultaneously. All five division rivals will play us at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe kick off in like five minutes. I should go. As the leader of this team, I can\xe2\x80\x99t be late for the national anthem, the pledge of allegiance, the eldritch chant of national unity, the Secret Police helicopter flyover, and the pre-game bloodstone bacchanal dance.\xe2\x80\x9d Now the reporters frantically shouted the rest of their questions. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to protest your quarterback\xe2\x80\x99s disqualification?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow will you compete against five teams at once?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow many balls will be used?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we go when we die\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is football? Are you a football?\xe2\x80\x9d But Beaumont had already left.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word that the game has kicked off at the Night Vale High School. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m not a sports fan, but even I\xe2\x80\x99m intrigued. I gotta see this. \n\n Uh, let me take you now To the weather. \n\n [Raising Helvetica'
