Episode 87 - The Trial of Hiram  McDaniels
b'Numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t lie. But humans using\nnumbers lie all the time.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n The trial of Hiram McDaniels \xe2\x80\x93\nfive-headed dragon, former mayoral candidate, and current presumed\ncriminal \xe2\x80\x93 is coming to a close. There are only a few minor legal\ntechnicalities to get through, such as testimony from the remaining\nwitnesses, arguments from the lawyers, and deliberation from the\njury. And then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have all that bureaucratic mess out of the way\nand be able to get to the verdict. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be covering the trial as it\ncontinues, so stay tuned here for all your trial info.\n\n And now for Community Classifieds.\n\n Item: Big Rico\xe2\x80\x99s Pizza is looking for\na new cashier. Must have retail experience and be good at not talking\nif they know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for them. No funny business! No secret wheat\nspeakeasies. Why would you even bring that up? Who have you been\ntalking to? To apply, look at yourself in the mirror for a long time,\nuntil your face no longer seems to be your own.\n\n Item: Have you seen a tall shadow\nwhere no shadow should be cast? Have you seen a person exist in two\nplaces at the same time? Have you seen a young girl with an\nupside-down face? No, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. That would be ridiculous! Grow up!\nSincerely, Richard. Also, if anyone\xe2\x80\x99s seen my wife, please let me\nknow.\n\n Item: Lost cat. Blindingly bright,\norb-shaped, often visible in the sky during daylight hours. If found,\nplease worship.\n\n And finally,\n\n Item: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten you all. I\nlet you live the first time. The next time you may not be so lucky.\nLove, The Woman From Italy.\n\n This has been Community Classifieds.\n\n The Night Vale Parks Department\nannounced that after a multi-year, 5 million dollar repair and\nrenovation project, the Beatrix Lowman Memorial Meditation Zone is\nonce again open for public use. The Meditation Zone, a\nstate-of-the-art meditation facility, was destroyed by a\nmultidimensional sentient pyramid almost four years ago. But the\nParks Department used that crisis as an opportunity to update the\nmeditation mats, equipment, and machines. Now you can be hooked up\nand meditating in no time! And it\xe2\x80\x99s almost twice as efficient as\nbefore, when measured in gallons per kilowatt.\n\n The rebuilding was funded with a\nsimple tax levied on every school child per school day they attended,\nand the construction only went three years and 4.9 million dollars\nover budget. We look forward to enjoying the new Beatrix Lowman\nMemorial Meditation Zone for years to come.\n\n Today the mayor herself, my former\nintern and current friend Dana Cardinal, took the witness stand in\nHiram\xe2\x80\x99s trial \xe2\x80\x93 the final witness in the trial of the century. She\nlooked at the citizen who had tried to overthrow her beating heart,\nto sabotage her lungs, to end the administration of life within her\nbody, and calmly she met his eyes. And then calmly, she met his eyes.\nAnd then she met his eyes calmly. And then, still calm, she met his\neyes. She did not even glance at the violet head, the only head who\ndid not participate in the crimes against her.\n\n Her hands were tight in front of her.\nHer shoulders were back. She looked tired, and she looked determined,\nand heavy with stress, and still barreling forward.\n\n Judge Azdaq asked her to swear to\ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou want the whole\ntruth?\xe2\x80\x9d Dana said.\n\n Everyone\ngot very quiet. That is not a question that is asked often in a town\nlike ours, and it carries a dangerous weight.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwill give you all of it. And nothing but,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n The\ndefense attorney and the prosecutor, two identical men both named\nTroy Walsh, objected in unison. Although their objections were\nunclear, and consisted of a high-pitched panicked \xe2\x80\x9cNo, stop her!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe judge upheld both objections.\n\n But\nDana ignored all this.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBeing\nmayor means carrying many secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so young to\ncarry so much. Now, you will share in my burden.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nshe began to tell the truth. All of it, as she knew it. Obviously we\ncan report nothing of what she said. Most of the crowd fled,\nhorrified of what would be done with them if they heard even a\nfragment of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s testimony. The judge felt obligated to stay,\nbut put on the sound-canceling headphones they assign all judges so\nnone of them will hear anything that might make life too complicated.\nOnly Hiram, already charged, already a criminal, listened with\ninterest as Dana unfurled the shadows within her.\n\n And\nthen, she was done. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded to the judge,\nnodded to Hiram, collected her belongings, and walked out of the\ncourtroom.\n\n So\nthe trial is continuing just fine, and we should reach justice \xe2\x80\x93\nwhatever that means \xe2\x80\x93 quite soon.\n\n Obviously,\nthe transcript for this day of the trial will be burned, along with\nthe court stenographer.\n\n And\nnow, the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n Up\nis up, and down is down. Left is right, and right is left.\n\n To\nthe west there are the highest highs, and to the east there are\nthe lows. The up top is where the bluebirds go, and the\nwitching happens down below.\n\n If\nyou need to cross the street, mind your shoes and mind your\nfeet. For there are more to streets than horns that bleat, or\ncars that speed, or lights that lead.\n\n There\nis something stranger yet that wants to take you, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nforget. Yes, there is something stranger still, and if it can,\nit could and it would and it will.\n\n Its\nteeth are sharp, its eyes are sharp, its voice a dulcet maze. So\nwalk real quick and step real light, and always look both ways.\n\n Look\nto the left to see your own death, and look to the right to avoid\na great fright.\n\n And\nlook for what hides under the cars that pass by, under the trucks\nthat speed, under the pavement weeds, under the asphalt and\nsand, look for a quick grasping hand.\n\n Up\nis up, and down is down. Left is right, and right is left.\n\n To\nthe west there are the highest highs, and to the east there are the\nlows. The up top is where the bluebirds go, and the witching\nhappens down below.\n\n This\nhas been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n The\nNight Vale Airport announced a trial run of international flights.\nPreviously there were only the regular flights to LAX, JFK, XTA,\nBurbank, and \xe2\x80\x93 of course \xe2\x80\x93 King City. But now, airport\nadministration is unveiling plans to reach more than 50 international\ndestinations including Mexico, Double Mexico, and Svitz.\n\n How\nthese plans can be achieved \xe2\x80\x93 in a one-terminal airport with no\ncustoms facilities and only the capacity to handle two passenger\nplanes at a time \xe2\x80\x93 has not been answered.\n\n Martin\nMcCaffrey, local representative of the TSA, waved away objections to\nthe changes. Standing in front of reporters and literally waving his\narms in physical dismissal of the questions being raised. He also\nadded an occasional \xe2\x80\x9cPshhht!\xe2\x80\x9d and eye roll.\n\n He\nthen gave a statement:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNow\nthat I have provided an official response to the technical questions\non this matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s important to this\ntown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nopened a box, which contained hundreds \xe2\x80\x93 if not thousands \xe2\x80\x93 of\nhand-drawn sketches depicting a strange, elongated dark figure\ncrawling out of a kitchen refrigerator.\n\n Martin\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI find one of these on my pillow each morning when I wake\nup. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who is drawing them, or why. Who is doing this to\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\ncollapsed to his knees, his face a perfect portrait of anguish, while\nabove him the bright pink banner saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCELEBRATING A NEW AIRPORT\nFOR A NEW NIGHT VALE\xe2\x80\x9d flapped loudly in the rising wind, each gust\nbringing a sharp bark of plastic as Martin crouched beneath,\nretreated into a sad helpless silence.\n\n You\nknow, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t traveled out of the country in a long time. I have\nhalf a mind to hop on one of those planes and head to Svitz\nagain\xe2\x80\xa6ooh, or even somewhere new! Maybe Carlos and I could check\nout a nice resort somewhere tropical. Ahh, that\xe2\x80\x99d be so fun!\n\n Mmm\xe2\x80\xa6Martin\nis now weeping, and crawling away from the podium, dragging his\ncrumpled-up sketches with him, spit and snot dripping off his face,\nforming a trail in the dirt below him.\n\n A\ntropical vacation could be just what we need!\n\n And\nfinally, a word from our sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is sponsored by Kleenex brand tissue products.\n\n We\nknow that you have a lot of choices when it comes to your nose. For\ninstance, you could choose to simply not have one. Just pop it right\noff and go on with your day unhindered. Or you could choose to have\nmultiple decorative noses that turn your face into a provocative\nmodern sculpture. But instead, you decided to have just the one\nnose\xe2\x80\xa6that half the time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, and is exactly between your\neyes, where it sits distractingly in your vision at all times for no\nreason. Of course, your brain tunes that out\xe2\x80\xa6unless someone calls\nattention to it, so I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s not too bad.\n\n But,\nin general, you\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen the barely-functioning weird nose you have.\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re sure glad you did!\n\n Kleenex\nbrand tissue products. You have a lot of choices in life. We\xe2\x80\x99re glad\nyou \xe2\x80\x93 for some reason \xe2\x80\x93 chose the faulty body you have.\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsors.\n\n Update\nfrom the trial:\n\n In a\nlast-minute surprise, there has been a complete turnover in the\nmakeup of the jury. Previously, the jury was made up of seven humans\nand an A.I. simulating a five-headed dragon. This was all pretty\nstandard. But now, without warning, announcement, or any decision\nfrom the judge, the seven humans were removed from the jury. In their\nstead were seven strangers. The strangers were unmoving, unblinking.\nThey breathed audible, even breaths. The hiss of air through their\nnostrils, eyes fixed on nothing.\n\n Judge\nAzdaq said that she does not approve of this change\xe2\x80\xa6but also that\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s too scared to question it. And anyway, she would find it hard\nto enforce any actions against it, since the bailiff, too, is now a\nstranger, unmoving, except that every time the judge looks away and\nlooks back again, she swears the stranger is slightly closer than she\nwas before.\n\n The\ndefense attorney, on behalf of the four heads he represents, offered\nstrong objections from behind his desk, where he was hiding from the\nstrangers. The prosecuting attorney joined his objections, and also\njoined him behind the desk.\n\n There\nwas very little comment from the observers in the gallery \xe2\x80\x93 as most\nof them, too, had been replaced by unmoving breathing strangers.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nI guess we should get right to deliberations, then,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the\njudge through the closed and locked door of her chambers.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t even given our closing arguments!\xe2\x80\x9d said both attorneys\nsimultaneously, sitting back-to-back so that they could keep their\neyes on as many of the strangers as possible.\n\n The\njudge considered this argument, and responded by screaming that one\nof the strangers was in her chamber, and how did he get in there? The\nTroys did not have an answer for that, and so the deliberations\nbegin.\n\n Listeners,\nwhile we wait to hear the verdict to this eventful and historic\ntrial, let us take a quick peak at the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cCocaine\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Holy\nMoly]\n\n The\ntrial of Hiram McDaniels is over. A verdict has been reached.\n\n The\njury that consisted of an A.I. simulation of a five-headed dragon and\nseven silent unmoving strangers only deliberated for a few minutes\nbefore returning with a verdict of guilty on all charges.\n\n The\nstrangers breathed heavy, visible breaths. The A.I. booped and\nwhistled. It was all very quiet, and polite, and quick.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nheads responded in ways as different as their personalities.\n\n Green,\nof course, roared and spat out a stream of fire unlike any ever seen\nfrom him before \xe2\x80\x93 white in its pure heat.\n\n Gold\nnodded gravely, a politician politically accepting bad news.\n\n Blue\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t react visibly at all.\n\n Gray\nslumped and curled into his own long neck, a look of supreme\ndejection on his reptilian features.\n\n And\nPurple sat tall \xe2\x80\x93 in satisfaction, rather than celebration.\n\n Judge\nAzdaq said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to sentencing then.\xe2\x80\x9d And Troy Walsh,\nlawyer for the defendants, prepared to speak, but the judge went on\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no arguments to be made. If Hiram is guilty of\nattacking the mayor, of attacking the very civic structure of our\ntown, then Hiram must be put to death. We have no choice,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nconcluded.\n\n Even\nTroy Walsh, the prosecuting attorney, was taken aback by this sudden\nand severe sentence. He met eyes with his identical legal opposition,\nand made a small shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I supposed to do here?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsignaled through the expressive language of the body. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmy problem, I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\nproblem, but not my\nproblem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\njudge continued. \xe2\x80\x9cSentence will be carried out once all appeals\nhave been received and disposed of. The guilty four heads will be\nkilled with a single bullet each, so as not to harm the lungs, heart,\nor any other part of the body shared with the violet head, who is not\ncharged by this court.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d\nViolet shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am connected to them completely!\nIf my other heads die, then I will die, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Green\ncontinued to roar, and for the first time, there was a hard spine of\nanguish within the pulse of his anger.\n\n Gray\nsobbed loudly and unashamed.\n\n Gold,\nstill nodding at the court with a politician\xe2\x80\x99s poker face, surprised\nhimself by throwing up \xe2\x80\x93 and, in doing so, gave up the pretense of\ngeniality. He, too, began to sob.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\nafraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judge Azdaq, removing her glasses and cleaning them\ndistractedly with a bit of her robe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat justice is more\nimportant than the life of every innocent who comes through this\ncourt. If there is damage to more than the perpetrators, then that is\nunfortunate, but unavoidable. Take him away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Since\nthe bailiff was an unmoving stranger, the helpful (but doomed) court\nstenographer led Hiram away.\n\n Violet\nhowled that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this, that he was not charged with any\ncrime, but no one intervened.\n\n A\njanitor trundled her cart forward to mop up the vomit left by Gold.\n\n The\nfew humans left observing the court seemed at a loss for what to do,\nand started to disperse in uncertain, uneven groups.\n\n The\nA.I. did not move, because it was a computer.\n\n The\nstrangers in the courtroom did not move, either \xe2\x80\x93 although they\nseemed just a little closer to the onlookers than they were before.\n\n And\nso\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s it. That was the trial of Hiram McDaniels. He will be\nkilled. His violet head, innocent, will also die.\n\n So\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s justice\xe2\x80\xa6I guess. I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. Good work, us\xe2\x80\xa6I\nguess.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the awful void of your own doubts and feelings.\n\n Goodnight\xe2\x80\xa6I\nguess.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: \xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s the\nbrakes, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the most annoying driving instructor ever.'
