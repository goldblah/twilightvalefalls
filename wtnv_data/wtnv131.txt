b'Cecil: It is time for one of our favorite segments: Louie Blasko\xe2\x80\x99s music moment!\n\n Louie Blasko: No. \xc2\xa0\n\n Cecil: No?\n\n LB: No I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna do music, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get out of the whole\xe2\x80\xa6 music thing. I, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tell a ghost story.\n\n Cecil: But but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a ukulele and a music stand?\n\n LB: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\n\n Cecil: OK. So listeners, it is now time for Louie Blasko\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 ghost story moment!\n\n LB: Thank you Cecil. Now my horror story is about a haunted locker room at Night Vale High.\n\n Cecil: Mm.\n\n LB: Now there have always been strange sounds heard in there, you know footsteps, the cawing of crows. Distant warped voices singing the Night Vale High fight song.\n\n Cecil: Wait wait wait, Night Vale High has a fight song?\n\n LB: Oh yeah, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s that song they sing before every football game to remind us that no matter who wins, everyone involved will eventually perish.\n\n Cecil: It\xe2\x80\x99s not really ringing a bell.\n\n LB: No no no, it\xe2\x80\x99s uh, [tone-deaf] \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that to him, uh he had nothing to do with any of this\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\n Cecil: No\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n LB: You know it\xe2\x80\x99s like uh, \xe2\x80\x9cI-I was gonna get you the money, I just needed like\xe2\x80\x9d um\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil: I dunno, maybe, I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n LB: OK OK. W-w- uh [clears throat]. [plays ukulele, sings] \xe2\x80\x9cWhen doing business with spiideers, I advice that you always honor your debts. I have it on the very good authority of the most reliable insiiiider, that though they seem harmless, even dare I say kind, on the day of the deal when the contract is signed, and though, [out of breath] I cannot stress enough that you must bear in mind that they do not forgive and they will not forget\xe2\x80\xa6 \n\n [high-pitched] \xe2\x80\x9cOoo-ooo, ooo-oooo, o-o-o-a ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo\xe2\x80\xa6 \n\n [speaks] And you can tell yourself: What have I possibly got to lose? But even a humble music teacher, who has never known the warm breath of love, whose cold heart has no room in it for friendship, companionship, partnership or any manner of ship whatsoever. They will find, who long ago traded his soul for a can of trombone grease, and a very rare limited edition Chet Baker LP. No, even a man such as this is not immune, for somehow they know [whispers] the architecture of his heart even better than he knows it himself. And they will find that one thing or person that he cherishes above all else in this world, that single creature whose presence gives him just a little rush of joy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll use just for example, [sings] a boy.\n\n [talks] A pudgy, awkward little boy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just call him Harold. Ignored and abused by his schoolmates, spectacularly unmemorable in almost every respect. But with a certain promise on the clarinet and not without a charming \xe2\x80\x93 lack of fashion sense.\n\n [high-pitched] Oooo-ooo, ooo-oo-oo, o-o-o-o-a-oooo-ooo-oooo. [yells] Everybody! [Cecil and audience chime in] Ooo-ooo, o-o-o-a- ooo-oo-ooo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [yells] They act with speed, great precision, and professional care. Leaving just a small smudge of blood and a little bit of hair. And an endlessly echoing scream through the halls! [speaks] As if to intimate that his horrible suffering has still not ended yet, [screams] at aaaall!\n\n  [speaks] And I know that the terms of the contract were abundantly [high-pitched] cleeear! The language concise, and the interest rates [falsetto] faaaaiiiir! But as much as one pleads and as much as one begs, to their eight empty eyes and their long furry legs\xe2\x80\xa6 [quietly] He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming back. He really isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming back. Ooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [yells] You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that to him! He had nothing to do with any of this! I was going to get you the money, I told you that! Ooooooo-oooo, oooo-oo-o-ooo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Four, three, two, one! [Cecil joins in] Night Vale High is number one! Zero, negative one, negative two, if we go down then so will you!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n LB: [yells] I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry, Harold! I am so so sorry!\n\n Cecil: OK, yes, I do remember that song now. Great, great. So OK, um, let\xe2\x80\x99s get on with the story then.\n\n LB: What? Oh oh oh oh yeah uh, that was the story. Uh, Night Vale High\xe2\x80\x99s locker room, it\xe2\x80\x99s haunted. Uh.. the end?\n\n Cecil: OK.\n\n LB: Well, thanks for having me. Oh and if anyone wants to learn the basics of bluegrass, just head down to the burned down site where Louie\xe2\x80\x99s Music Shop used to sit, and just hang out there in the ruins til it gets dark. And then, wait until you are taken gently by the hand. And then, bluegrass lessons! Or something else - will happen.\n\n Cecil: Thank you, Louie!'
