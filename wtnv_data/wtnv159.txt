136 - The Mudstone Abyss Part 2
b'Kevin: Age is just a number that counts quickly upward to an ending point.\n\n Welcome to Desert Bluffs.\n\n Hello, Desert Bluffs! Let\xe2\x80\x99s start there. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a greeting, a simple hello and of course, a huge smile. Then let\xe2\x80\x99s move right into the good news, the happy news. \n\n Charles and I went on our first date many weeks back, and it was magical! I met up with him in the new town square, which is a sand dune with a cow skull on it. I was wearing my best rabbit fur coveralls and rainbow-striped head band. He was wearing a rose gold lame cravat and soccer shin guards. We went to eat at Desert Bluffs\xe2\x80\x99 newest restaurant, Vermillion, which specializes in lip meat. We shared a bottle of Cabernet and talked comfortably about all the things you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about on a first date. Politics \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re both theocrats -, religion \xe2\x80\x93 we were both raised in the arborial faith -, sex \xe2\x80\x93 we both have had it \xe2\x80\x93 and banking. We had some polite disagreements here. Later we went back to my house next to the Temple of Joy. It had been a long time since either of us had had - [chuckling] well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna share too much. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll skip to the next morning, where over coffee we talked about our dreams, or rather dream. It was that same shared dream that all Desert Bluffs citizens have every night with the birds flying in seemingly random directions over the cornfield before crashing their bodies into the ground. Charles, being new in town, had a lot of questions about this dream. But I said that the dream is nothing more than a simple pleasure we all share as a community. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to know that the whole time sometimes wakes up at the exact same time, sweating and screaming for joy! \n\n After enriching conversation and strong coffee, he said he had to go meet someone. When I asked who, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it later, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal.\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed me and I smiled like I have not smiled in years. I smiled so hard that every glass object in my kitchen exploded all at once. A lacerating confetti of joy. \n\n An update on the construction of the new Mudstone Abyss. Mayor Lauren Mallard reported today that the dig is behind schedule. She sighted a shortage of workers. She had planned for a larger turnout of labor, but this simply has not manifested. I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed to hear this, Desert Bluffs, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly understandable. We all have jobs and responsibilities, and making time to contribute to the building of this great monument can be difficult. Desert Bluffs is a place of hope, of renewal, of refuge for those in need and above all, of joy. The Mudstone Abyss is a celebration of all those things, and I tell you now that the reward will be great. Not just the reward of being devoured by the Smiling God, but the reward of your eternal impact on your town. Think of the Rapa Nui people who built the Moai, or the proud union workers who erected that deco masterpiece, the Chrysler Building. Or the time traveling street artist collective known as Banksy, who built Stonehenge. \n\n Every great monument is built by human hands, and those hands leave their artistry for generations to enjoy, discover, and study. The Mudstone Abyss will be a triumph of Desert Bluffs citizens, and later a tourist attraction, and later a historical landmark, and eventually a curious and misunderstood artefact of a long dead civilization. You can be part of this. \n\n Mayor Mallard and I put our heads together and agreed that the solution here is to set up communes and camps along the dig site to make your commutes easier. Schools and businesses will go on half day schedules so that everyone can make time for the monument. Mayor Mallard, and I support her brilliant idea 100 per cent \xe2\x80\x93 believes this is the only task we should be focused on as a town. The Smiling God deserves a physical manifestation of our penitence and devotion. Desert Bluffs deserves a notable landmark, and best of all, if we all worked and lived together, we would get to know each other\xe2\x80\x99s interests, cultures, languages, histories. If we worked together, we could become so much \xe2\x80\x93 closer. \n\n And now a word from our sponsors. When we talk apocalypse, we talk fires and spires of smoke and screams and wars and horrid clouds of ash and floods. And this is a comforting vision, because it supposes we\xe2\x80\x99re all in it together. But death is mostly something you keep to yourself. In all reality, the apocalypse is likely going to just be you alone in a room with the flu. Bed, Bath and Beyond: you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need some new sheets.\n\n So after my first date with Charles, we went out again the following week. I showed him around Desert Bluffs, I took him to the Sandy Blossom Bowling Alley and Arcade Joy Compound. We bowled that afternoon and played a few old video games like Ms. Pac-Man, Sleepytime Spider Swallower, and Horse Carcass, all the classics from our youth. We then went for a romantic walk along the beach. Charles thought it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be called a beach because there was no body of water, but I pointed out that it was sand, and that there was water somewhere. How close the water is is all a matter of faith. He laughed, and I squeezed his hand. Then we went to the food truck park. He bought some cheese pirogues from the Odessa Dumplings truck, while I went to the Tex-Mex truck and got a burrito filled with fiberglass insulation and refried beans. \n\n The food trucks weren\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as classy as Vermillion, but food is only as good as the company you enjoy it with. And I really enjoyed my time with Charles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to intimately connect to people especially as you get older, but my time with Charles made dating seem easy. Why would anyone choose to be single when they could just walk up to the perfect man and say \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s know each other\xe2\x80\x9d? When life is good, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand how it could have ever been bad.\n\n After dinner, I suggested we could go get a drink together. Unfortunately Desert Bluffs doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bars. Not for religious reasons, I explained to him. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that no one\xe2\x80\x99s been able to open one yet. The state places some pretty high taxes on hard liquor transported across dimensional rifts. So I offered to have him back over to my place for some more wine. But he said he had to be going. I protested. Charles said, \xe2\x80\x9cKevin. You fill me with such joy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna keep secrets. I should tell you I have a son. His name is Donovan and he\xe2\x80\x99s five. He\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet kid.\xe2\x80\x9d Charles said he moved here because Donovan starts school next year, and he wanted to raise his boy in a community based in happiness and positivity. But Charles is concerned about bringing dates home with him until he knows they will stay around for a while. \xe2\x80\x9cKevin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching my face along the socket of my left eye. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you would be great around Donovan.\xe2\x80\x9d My smile disappeared from my face. Not because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel happy, but because I felt \xe2\x80\x93 so many things. My lips couldn\xe2\x80\x99t express them all. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting we have to be serious right now, we have to figure that out with time.\xe2\x80\x9d He then said we should go back to his place, but on the way, he needed to pick up Donovan from Grandma Josephine, who has been babysitting. We spent the rest of the evening drinking sodas at his home. I wanted to touch Charles, to put my hand against his chest again, to kiss him with real passion. But instead we watched Donovan play with toy airplanes and Charles talked about the things parents talk about. \n\n Donovan was nice, but I had to concentrate hard to keep my smile. \n\n [long pause] An update on the construction of the Mudstone Abyss. Nearly everyone in town is now at the dig site, setting into their lean-to\xe2\x80\x99s and pop tents and gathering up the appropriate tools for the physical labor ahead. Mayor Lauren Mallard said she is heartened by the outpouring of support in the past hour. We have made huge strides, already marking out our mile-wide parameter and deepening the pit to almost 1,000 feet. Some stone workers have even begun carving sacred texts from the Book of Devouring. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting reports from the construction area that some of those etchings have begun to glow bright white, as the earth trembles beneath them. Wow! I\xe2\x80\x99m getting chills just thinking about this!\n\n There have been some scuffles among the workers, miscommunication and arguments that devolved into small fights. The Desert Bluffs police department sent two officers, who are also friends of mine from the Temple of Joy, Keon and Kelton, to break up some of these skirmishes. But more fights and arguments happened than they could control. Officers Keon and Kelton reported that parties involved in fights were shouting nonsense at each other. They initially thought some were non-English speakers, but they could not identify the languages. Then they saw young Ryan Nichols, who was an English major at Ala-bay-, Al-bama, at his former university, spouting absolute gibberish at another person. Keon and Kelton reported that sometimes people\xe2\x80\x99s words sounded like normal English, but without any context or meaning, and at other times like unconventional noises that are not common to any human language. But everyone speaks passionately and personally, thinking they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating what they mean, even though they were not. Apparently the fighting became pervasive enough that Mayor Mallard had to make a public address. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a transcript of what she said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDesert Bluffs, please do not fight. Remember to take time to smile and relate to one another. If someone says something you do not understand or do not appreciate, simply cauliflower. Roomba starlight rice tank ship. Stallion the ballisters right on through, until balloons.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she repeated \xe2\x80\x9cuntil balloons\xe2\x80\x9d over and over, with complete conviction and passion. And eventually the fighting stopped, not because of the speech but because of sheer confusion and exhaustion. \n\n As the fighting stopped, so did the construction. No one knew what anyone was saying, longtime friends could not find their words and so resorted to physical gestures. But even Jerry Kramer and his daughter Morgan, who communicate mostly through sign language, found that they could no longer comprehend any of the phrases. \n\n More on this developing situation, but first a look at traffic. Near the dig site for the Mudstone Abyss, several hazy dark shadows, vaguely human-shaped, have begun to appear. They are drifting along city streets, which has caused nearly a dozen minor traffic.. uh.. a-ci-des. Ac-dicent. Acci..dents. There is a ten minute backup entering downtown along sci-fi novel. Al-along rhubarb. Ugh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t oak tree, can\xe2\x80\x99t sparrow modem. Spar-row mmodem. Sparrowmodem. That\xe2\x80\x99s not right. I have to condensate. Ugh. Have to con-den-sate. Yellow refrigerator shelves. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say \xe2\x80\x93 crab grass to the petroleum!\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cShe Left Without A Goodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d by Cerah https://soundcloud.com/cerahmusic]\n\n Machine: First unheard message.\n\n Charles: Kevin. Sorry to bother you, it\xe2\x80\x99s Charles. I need you to get the word out that language doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work right in Desert Bluffs. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found a single dictionary that expresses normal word structure, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been recording and re-recording this message for the past hour and each time it comes out like alphabet soup. No syntax, no identifiable verbs, no words that even appear to fit together. But I did finally manage to find an old text you wrote about the souls of unpure, those whom the Smiling God cannot clean even upon devour. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain style of hat you described that can keep your thoughts and ideas pure. I-I drove over to your house, because I remember you had one just like this you told me you wore during sermons. Sorry for going through your stuff, but the hat seems to be working for now.\n\n Anyway, based on my research, I think this dig is (loosing) those spirits back into the world and they\xe2\x80\x99re causing\xe2\x80\xa6 [whispers] There\xe2\x80\x99s something at my door, Kevin. I-I need to go, OK? Call you back in well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \n\n Machine: End of message.\n\n Charles: [whispering] There\xe2\x80\x99s a hazy dark shadow hovering about my front door, Kevin. It\xe2\x80\x99s not knocking, it\xe2\x80\x99s just hovering in front of my house. I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out a face, I\xe2\x80\x99m peering through a crack in the living room blinds to get a better look. Oh no, I think it saw me! \n\n Machine: End of message.\n\n Charles: OK, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone I think. This giant yellow hat is really remarkable. Anyway, I wanted you to get the word out on your radio show about the dig and let your friend Lauren know as well. If we can fully (stop) this giant (pit), I think we can stem the return of these unpure souls, who I think are dismantling our language.\n\n Also\xe2\x80\xa6 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from you in a while. I hope bringing Donny around didn\xe2\x80\x99t scare you off. If it did, please just tell me now, OK, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. I would definitely be hurt if you stopped seeing me because I have a child, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be bitter. That\xe2\x80\x99s really it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be bitter if you tell me now. Now that I think of it, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true either. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be less bitter, less hurt, less angry if you tell me now. \n\n Or maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re busy. I know the Mudstone Abyss has all your attention these days and what with communication failing us, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think about having dinner or even, I dunno, like a family date. You and me and Donny, maybe a trip to the amusement park or\xe2\x80\xa6 We were thinking about adopting a cat, is there an animal shelter in Desert Bluffs? That could be a really fun day together. \n\n Either day, when you have a chance, just let me know you got this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna stop seeing you, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather know sooner than aquifer. Aquifer. What? I mean platter.\n\n Kevin, that shadow is back. He\xe2\x80\x99s not at my window anymore, he\xe2\x80\x99s inside graft huts. No I mean \xe2\x80\x93 grant first, grapple wigs grapple wigs, Kevin I \xe2\x80\x93 handlebar cereal, OK? Handlebar cereal. \n\n Machine: End of new message. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Girl, did you fall from heaven? \xe2\x80\x98Cause there\xe2\x80\x99s a giant crater where you landed and radiation levels are spiking.'
