The Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover
b"Joseph Fink: Everything that follows is not canon, except for the parts that are. \n\n\n S'tonge of the Galaxium: Oh, hi! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice you come in! \xe2\x80\x98Cept that I did. I notice everything. I\xe2\x80\x99m an omniscient being known as S'tonge of the Galaxium. If you were omniscient, you\xe2\x80\x99d know that already. But, 'cause y'aren\xe2\x80\x99t omniscient, I know, because\xe2\x80\xa6well, I am.\n\n\n I come from a race of beings powered cosmically by the force galactic. We live on the edges of what you know as reality, and what we call The Tommy Westphall Universe.\n\n\n For countless eons we have observed your worlds, and have recorded their significant events. By \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d as we have transcribed the events in my great cosmic book, using our pen cosmic. And now, we shall describe for you an event so tremendous, it caused us great sadness. And great bliss. We are a complicated guy.\n\n\n The event you are about to witness me witnessing is known throughout the Galaxium as Thrill Vale \xe2\x80\x93 Nope.\n\n\n Night Adventure \xe2\x80\x93 Worse.\n\n\n The Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover. On the nose, but works.\n\n\n But first, the great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is sponsored by Patriot brand cigarettes. Patriot brand cigarettes are good for your constitution.\n\n\n By WorkJuice brand coffee, the most caffeine-dense coffee legally available in this, or any, known reality.\n\n\n And by your longing for universal parity, underwritten by an attempt to make sense of the senseless and random universe\xe2\x80\xa6or is it?\n\n\n It is.\n\n\n The great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is a presentation in three acts, performed in the style of radio broadcasts both old and new. There will be a brief intermission during which you might ponder your existence, and purchase malted milk balls.\n\n\n The great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover is appropriate for all ages, as well as for those of you who possess no age at all. It is full of sound and fury, signifying\xe2\x80\xa6everything.\n\n\n And it begins like this:\n\n\n In your future, when the universe ever-expands into the wildest west of all, outer space, where one planet is thought to be light years beyond the reach of law and order, one man brings fear to robots and aliens, and hope to the humans who long to make this frontier planet their home. He is Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars.\n\n\n Sparks Nevada: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6from Earth.\n\n\n S'tonge: He is aided in his quest by his faithful Martian companion, Croach the Tracker.\n\n\n Croach: I am from G'loot Praktaw.\n\n\n Sparks: Just call it\xe2\x80\x93 Just call it Mars.\n\n\n Croach: You designate it Mars.\n\n\n Sparks: Just call it Mars.\n\n\n Croach: Not during the crossover.\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x99\xab When there\xe2\x80\x99s varmints need a-catchin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa and young'ns need a-savin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab on my rocket steed I race across the stars. \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa For I\xe2\x80\x99ve sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab to right the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n All: \xe2\x99\xaa Yes, he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x99\xab Oh, the hyper cattle\xe2\x80\x99s hummin\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa and the Marjun\xe2\x80\x99s savage drummin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars. \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa Yo, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6from Earth, \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab but I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n All: \xe2\x99\xaa Yes, he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x99\xab On the plains o\xe2\x80\x99 the red planet I uphold the law, \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa and I do it with a pair of robot fists. \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n All: Pow!\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x99\xab Evil extermination I have faced, \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa for my robot ropes, they hardly ever miss. \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n All:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x99\xab Hardly ever miss! \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x99\xaa And I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ridin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab in the name of truth and justice \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa for as long as I can count the shootin\xe2\x80\x99 stars, \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab for I\xe2\x80\x99ve sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa to right the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n All:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x99\xab Yes, he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars. \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n Sparks: And I\xe2\x80\x99m from Earth.\n\n\n S'tonge: The Mars day started like you would expect, especially if you were omniscient. Then, later in the day, Sparks Nevada and Croach the Tracker had a conversation in the Marshal Station. This conversation:\n\n\n Sparks: Croach, are you packing up, or\xe2\x80\xa6you going somewhere?\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada, yes. Having prepared the coffee beverage for the Marshal Station, my onus to you is complete.\n\n\n Sparks: Wait, really?\n\n\n Croach: I have served to relieve the onus of my people to you for the salvation of this, our planet.\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, yeah, that time I saved Mars, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\n Croach: I have saved your life many times.\n\n\n Sparks: As many as I\xe2\x80\x99ve saved yours?\n\n\n Croach: Yes. And I have prepared coffee very often.\n\n\n Sparks: And other stuff too, yeah.\n\n\n Croach: I am under onus to you for noticing.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah.\n\n\n Croach: And no longer under onus to you for not acknowledging my onus.\n\n\n Sparks: I said \xe2\x80\x9cyeah.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Croach: Hmm. An acknowledgement of the rhythm of conversations, not onuses.\n\n\n Sparks: Fair, I guess, yeah.\n\n\n Croach: And now I am under onus no longer. We are, as my people designated, eve end Steve end.\n\n\n Sparks: Wow, yeah. Uhh, OK, Croach.\n\n\n Croach: In all of our time together, you continue to butcher my name.\n\n\n Sparks: I totally do not. Croach.\n\n\n Croach: Croach.\n\n\n Sparks: Nnooo.\n\n\n Croach: Croach.\n\n\n Sparks: Nnooo.\n\n\n Croach: Croach. Now, please defy your human inclination to create an emotional scene of my parting.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gonna.\n\n\n Croach: Very well. Then I shall leave.\n\n\n Sparks: Bye.\n\n\n Croach: You are not becoming emotional?\n\n\n Sparks: No. Yes, uhh\xe2\x80\xa6you know\xe2\x80\xa6bye!\n\n\n Croach: Farewell, Sparks Nevada.\n\n\n Sparks: Mmm-hmm.\n\n\n Croach: Unless something stops me from departing\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: Um\xe2\x80\xa6no.\n\n\n Croach: I shall depart. Now.\n\n\n Sparks: OK.\n\n\n Croach: From here.\n\n\n Sparks: Bye.\n\n\n Croach: I am departing.\n\n\n Sparks: Are you, though? Because\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Felton: Marshal! Marshal! Heeeelllllllp!\n\n\n Croach: Human designated Felton, you have obstructed my exit!\n\n\n Felton: Oh, sorry, Croach! Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll step aside so\xe2\x80\x99s you can pass.\n\n\n Croach: No no no, I shall wait for you to enter completely.\n\n\n Felton: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep you.\n\n\n Croach: There is no rush.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, Croach, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stay, and hear what Felton\xe2\x80\x99s hollering about?\n\n\n Croach: Did the creature designated a fuzzy caterpillar traverse the surface of your arm?\n\n\n Felton: No! No. One time that happened, and let\xe2\x80\x99s all stop talking about it!\n\n\n Croach: I shall remain. Perhaps something threatens all of G'loot Praktaw.\n\n\n Sparks and Felton: That\xe2\x80\x99s Mars!\n\n\n Croach: Which you designate Mars.\n\n\n Sparks: Mars.\n\n\n Croach: And therefore threatens my tribe. If I were to save it, and them, they would be under onus to me.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, well let\xe2\x80\x99s find out. Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out via the worst part of marshaling: talking to a civilian. Umm, what\xe2\x80\x99s up, Felton? And don\xe2\x80\x99t say caterpillars.\n\n\n Felton: Marshal! Heeeellllllp!\n\n\n Sparks: I\xe2\x80\x99m right here.\n\n\n Felton: I was drinking in the Space Saloon, as I am wont to do these days for reasons of melancholy and loneliness, vis-\xc3\xa0-vis coming to terms with who I am, contrasting who I set out to be, and \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I enjoy being a rancher, hyper-cattle being good to me \xe2\x80\x93 but on a more personal level, I am lonely to a degree that don\xe2\x80\x99t befit my person. What if it does? What does that say about my person? And there\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: Felton\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Felton: type of thought circle runnin\xe2\x80\x99 through my head, but space rotguts both hurt and help. Barkeep was near to cuttin\xe2\x80\x99 me off at precise the number of space rotguts I asked him to. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good fella, if occasionally fixated on the possibility of trouble at his place.\n\n\n Sparks: Trouble at his place, yeah. Felton\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Felton: When, what should come a-bangin\xe2\x80\x99 in, but trouble! Right where Barkeep didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it, and where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t either, pondering as I was upon matters of self and love and so-forth.\n\n\n Sparks: Felton! What kind of trouble?\n\n\n Felton: What kind of trouble? The worst kind! Robot outlaws! Also a human who ain\xe2\x80\x99t a robot, but who is an outlaw. I runned out as soon as they started talking about gunnin\xe2\x80\x99 for you, Marshal! So\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99d have enough time to prepare yourself for their eventual arrival here! Here at\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Claxon: Which one of you flesh and bone and blood and nerves and organs-havin\xe2\x80\x99 so-and-sos is Sparks Nevady, Marshal on Mars?\n\n\n Nice Man Dan: Oh, Claxon? I done told you, having tussled with Nevada before, I\xe2\x80\x99ll point him out to you.\n\n\n Claxon: With what? Usin\xe2\x80\x99 sacks of gelatin that won\xe2\x80\x99t never be 100% reliable to identify 'em in your mouth to point 'em out?\n\n\n Dan: Exactly.\n\n\n Samuel Bolt: Well, ha ha, don\xe2\x80\x99t take no offense, Nice Man Dan. You\xe2\x80\x99re nice.\n\n\n Claxon:Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re nice. We just wanna shoot somethin\xe2\x80\x99!\n\n\n Sparks: Well, we got some tin cans on the fence out back.\n\n\n Felton: Not my can collections!\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Claxon: Being honest, sir, I prefer I shoot Sparks Nevada, the Marshal on Mars.\n\n\n Sparks: You\xe2\x80\x99re not gonna get that opportunity.\n\n\n Samuel: You\xe2\x80\x99re him? You\xe2\x80\x99re Nevady?\n\n\n Dan: Wait, you are?\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah. We have met.\n\n\n Dan: I did not recognize him! Shoulda oughta gotten my glasses prescription refilled, but I done shot my low-down cheatin\xe2\x80\x99-a-punker ophthy-mologist.\n\n\n Claxon: I got a good optometrist on Saturn.\n\n\n Samuel: Claxon, Dan\xe2\x80\x99s ophthalmologist was a medical doctor who completed college, and had at least eight years additional medical training. Whereas your Saturn optometrist ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but a four year degree-havin\xe2\x80\x99 nobody what can\xe2\x80\x99t do much more than give vision tests.\n\n\n Claxon: All\xe2\x80\x99s Dan wanted was a prescription upgrade!\n\n\n Dan: Well, I also got a itch in my eye wants a-proddin\xe2\x80\x99 and a-pokin\xe2\x80\x99 at in case it\xe2\x80\x99s serious.\n\n\n Sparks: I reckon I got something here pointed at you, might take care of any\xe2\x80\xa6problems you might have.\n\n\n Dan: Is that a laser\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: It\xe2\x80\x99s a laser pistol, yeah.\n\n\n Dan: \xe2\x80\xa6pistol. I\xe2\x80\x99d swear. I shoulda taken care of my eyes so they can take care of me like the poster says at my ophthalmologist\xe2\x80\x99s office.\n\n\n Sparks: Well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t gotta take care of all your eyes, just the ones you aim to keep. My eye doctor got that poster hangin\xe2\x80\x99 up. Bought it from a dentist, crossed out teeth, wrote in eyes. He\xe2\x80\x99s not great at it.\n\n\n Samuel: Don\xe2\x80\x99t fret about it, Nice Man Dan. Claxon and I got our own guns trained on the Marshal.\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada, though I am no longer under onus to you, I have directed my weapon upon these outlaws, thus putting you under onus to me.\n\n\n Sparks: Fine.\n\n\n Felton: And I am under onus to myself, due to how I\xe2\x80\x99m cowering under this d-d-d-d-d-d-desk.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, gold star, Felton.\n\n\n Nice Man Dan, last I saw you, you were headin\xe2\x80\x99 up to spend time with your boy, Highwayman Dan, to set him right. What happened?\n\n\n Dan: Can\xe2\x80\x99t say I know exactly, Marshal. Took a wrong turn somewhere.\n\n\n Felton: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you could all make chit-chat with guns pointin\xe2\x80\x99 every which way or at each other.\n\n\n Sparks: The talkin\xe2\x80\x99 keeps people from shootin\xe2\x80\x99, usually. Go on, Dan.\n\n\n Dan: Well, in the interest of fairness, we sold shoes for a piece, him investin\xe2\x80\x99 his time in my interests. Then, in the spirit of further fairness, he took me robbin\xe2\x80\x99 to show me his interests.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, and let me guess: you took better to robbin\xe2\x80\x99 than he did to shoes.\n\n\n Dan: Hahaha\xe2\x80\xa6exactly. Then he met a gal\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Claxon: And she introduced him, no doubt, to unprecedented levels of adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin.\n\n\n Samuel: No doubt. Hehe\xe2\x80\xa6humans, you know?\n\n\n Croach: Oh, yes.\n\n\n Felton: What happens? It happens \xe2\x80\x93 not to me, but to low-down highway robbers apparently.\n\n\n Dan: Hey, hey, that\xe2\x80\x99s my son.\n\n\n Felton: Sorry, kind of.\n\n\n Dan: You know, I felt like a third wheel, highway robbin\xe2\x80\x99 alongside them two. Then I realized, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t robbin\xe2\x80\x99 due to likin\xe2\x80\x99 it, so much as to be with my son is what I liked.\n\n\n Sparks: Awww.\n\n\n Dan: So, uh, we parted ways in hopes that they\xe2\x80\x99ll visit me sometimes on their own volition.\n\n\n Samuel: Holidays and such\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Dan: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly it.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, but hang on. If you quit robbin\xe2\x80\x99, why are you here with outlaws and guns?\n\n\n Dan: Fair question.\n\n\n Sparks:Thank you.\n\n\n Dan: I got one last score in me to provide the stake with which to return to the business community. Make shoes again.\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Claxon: From shoe man to robber to robbin\xe2\x80\x99 to become a shoe man again. You just never know where life will take a soul.\n\n\n Samuel: Robots ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no souls!\n\n\n Claxon: Was talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about his human soul, but since you bring it up, I reckon we do, in fact.\n\n\n Samuel: We don\xe2\x80\x99t. End of story.\n\n\n Claxon: We feel, we think, energy can neither be created nor destroyed\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Samuel: Oh, not everything is an invitation to a techno-theological conversation, Claxon!\n\n\n Claxon: Some things are, though!\n\n\n Sparks: I can settle it for you. I can settle it for you right now, send you to meet your maker.\n\n\n Samuel: Jeremy?\n\n\n Sparks: No\xe2\x80\x93 Jeremy? No.\n\n\n Samuel: Jeremy Wadnett\xe2\x80\x99s my maker.\n\n\n Sparks: No, I know what\xe2\x80\x93 no. No. I was talking techno-theologically.\n\n\n Croach: And observe how you have alienated precisely three fourths of the occupants of this room.\n\n\n All: [laughter]\n\n\n Samuel: A space Marjun just said 'alienate.\xe2\x80\x99 What a world.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s a doozy. All right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a doozy of a world. Dan, why are you robbin\xe2\x80\x99 the Marshal station if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a stake for a business? We don\xe2\x80\x99t keep no cash register.\n\n\n Dan: I\xe2\x80\x99m a stickler for plannin\xe2\x80\x99 plans! We aim to remove obstacles to our design from the large equation before we start openin\xe2\x80\x99 up bank vaults and the like.\n\n\n Sparks: Hmm.\n\n\n Samuel: You\xe2\x80\x99re that obstacle.\n\n\n Sparks: Am I? Yeah, no, thanks, I got it. Yeah.\n\n\n Claxon: And so\xe2\x80\x99s any flesh-wrapped guts-burrito in this room with you, since they\xe2\x80\x99re now privy to our plans.\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada, you are now under so much onus to me.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, all right.\n\n\n Felton: Marshal?\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n Felton: Heeelllllp!\n\n\n Sparks: OK.\n\n\n Felton: I\xe2\x80\x99m under the desk!\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah.\n\n\n Samuel: We know you\xe2\x80\x99re down there, dumdum! Want I should dispatch these two collateral damages, Dan?\n\n\n Sparks: Hang on, your trigger finger moves a hair, Sam Bolt, and Croach will shut you down.\n\n\n Samuel: Hair?? No thank you, but I take your meaning and I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll aim my guns at Croach, then.\n\n\n Croach: Onus!\n\n\n Claxon: Looks like we got ourselves an old-fashioned Venutian standoff, then, Marshal!\n\n\n Sparks: Nice Man Dan, you are aware the town bank offers low interest loans, right?\n\n\n Dan: Who\xe2\x80\x99d grant one to a fella whose resume reads \xe2\x80\x9c1: shoemaker, 2: outlaw, 3: third wheel, 4: back to outlaw?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Claxon: Don\xe2\x80\x99t let your occupation define you!\n\n\n Sparks: All right. Tell you what. Y'all stand down and maybe I can do somethin\xe2\x80\x99 to help you.\n\n\n Samuel: Us too?\n\n\n Sparks: No, you two are definitely goin\xe2\x80\x99 to jail.\n\n\n Dan: Well, then your offer is politely rejected, Marshal. I may not have much, but I still got my words. And leavin\xe2\x80\x99 these metal cattlemen to rust in jail would mean my fidelity tank is down to zero.\n\n\n Claxon: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of you to say, Dan.\n\n\n Dan: Now let\xe2\x80\x99s end this standoff, fellas. The hard way.\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Pemily Stallwark: Marshal Nevada! Come in, Sparks Nevada! It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Pemily Stallwark. I am callin\xe2\x80\x99 you on these here space comms.\n\n\n Sparks: All right. Uh, hang on a second, Dan.\n\n\n Dan: Hey, you got it.\n\n\n Claxon: Us too?\n\n\n Sparks: Yes, of course, you too. Yes.\n\n\n Dan: Yeah, hold off.\n\n\n Pemily: Claxon? Is that you?\n\n\n Claxon: In the iron!\n\n\n Pemily: Aww, dang it! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t run you off the moon just to have you go to Mars to cause trouble for my best friend and mentor!\n\n\n Claxon: Ain\xe2\x80\x99t sorry.\n\n\n Croach: Human designated Pemily Stallwark, I am present as well.\n\n\n Pemily: Howdy, Croach.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, listen, Pemily, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the middle of a Venutian standoff right now\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Dan: No, go ahead and take this, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be right here.\n\n\n Sparks: Thanks, Nice Man Dan, that is\xe2\x80\xa6really nice. All right, what is on your mind, Pemily?\n\n\n Pemily: Well, you know how you made me Marshal of the Moon?\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, you earned it, of course, yeah.\n\n\n Pemily: Yeah. You said that if'n things ever get hairy that I should contact you. Like I\xe2\x80\x99m doing now?\n\n\n Sparks: Things are getting hairy down there, are they, Marshal Stallwark?\n\n\n Samuel: Ugh, hair!\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Pemily: Somethin\xe2\x80\x99 hairy\xe2\x80\x99s happening, Marshal, but it defies description.\n\n\n Sparks: Try describin\xe2\x80\x99 it.\n\n\n Pemily: Sensible. It\xe2\x80\x99s the moon. The moon is disappearing.\n\n\n Samuel: What? OK, time out from the showdown, I want to see this.\n\n\n Felton: You can see the earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon from here?\n\n\n Samuel: Oh, you old humans got the worst possible ocular sensors, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you.\n\n\n Croach: Oh, I keep telling them.\n\n\n Samuel: OK.\n\n\n Croach: Bagropa! The moon of the earth is disappearing!\n\n\n Claxon: If'n the earth moon disappears, then the whole of the cosmos will be thrown into chaos!\n\n\n Samuel: And any satellite could be next.\n\n\n Claxon: Or planet, even!\n\n\n Felton: [groans] You think?\n\n\n Pemily: There\xe2\x80\x99s hairier information to impart. I got a deputy. She\xe2\x80\x99s a cyborg named Delores County, and she\xe2\x80\x99s whip smart, same as I\xe2\x80\x99m whip tough. We get along despite our differences, and sometimes we learn along the way that we ain\xe2\x80\x99t so different.\n\n\n Sparks: All right. Well, sounds great. She got a theory about how or why your moon\xe2\x80\x99s disappearin\xe2\x80\x99?\n\n\n Pemily: Oh, more'n that. She\xe2\x80\x99s pinpointed the source of the danger to thousands of years ago in the past!\n\n\n Samuel: If I may\xe2\x80\xa6time is dangerous. Just my opinion.\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Claxon: Second!\n\n\n Pemily: Deputy County rigged a mechanism whereby she can send someone to the past to stop what\xe2\x80\x99s causing my moon to disappear!\n\n\n Sparks: OK, well, like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of got my hands full right\xe2\x80\x93 ooooh, you know what? Hang on.\n\n\n [Sound of laser blasters]\n\n\n Claxon: Yeoow! You shot my dumb hands off!\n\n\n Samuel: Hey! We\xe2\x80\x99re in a time out!\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n [Sound of laser blasters]\n\n\n Samuel: My\xe2\x80\xa6my guns! You shot 'em to pieces!\n\n\n Dan: I am lowering and droppin\xe2\x80\x99 my gun, Marshal.\n\n\n Sparks: Very good.\n\n\n Dan: Well\xe2\x80\xa6let me tell you, cosmic little stuff is a strong argument not to shoot Marshals.\n\n\n Sparks: Mmm-hmm.\n\n\n Claxon: Plans go out the window for the sake of the cosmos, dude.(?)\n\n\n Sparks: All right. Pemily? Now I can probably go.\n\n\n Pemily: Oh, great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll activate the remote temporal shift beam to your coordinates.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, and I will just stand right here.\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada. You shot the metal enemy whose firearm was aimed at me. I am now under onus to you for saving me.\n\n\n Sparks: No, great.\n\n\n Croach: My final onus.\n\n\n Sparks: Croach, we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about your onus when I get back, all right? For now, just\xe2\x80\xa6wha\xe2\x80\x93?\n\n\n [Sound of time travel]\n\n\n Croach: Oooooonnnuuuuuuuusssssssss!\n\n\n Cecil: Today you will meet a beautiful stranger. Actually, hundreds of beautiful strangers. Everyone is beautiful and you know almost none of them.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n\n Great news, listeners! Today is the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival, sponsored by the Civic Committee for Public Holidays and Private Silent Weeping for No Reason You Can Name. All citizens are encouraged to gather in Mission Grove Park, where we will attempt to destroy the moon.\n\n\n The hastily-formed Civic Committee, which just sort of popped up last Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 and, like most local organizations, is anonymously managed \xe2\x80\x93 is also encouraging you to bring your children to the festival.\n\n\n Or, if you do not have children, to bring someone else\xe2\x80\x99s children.\n\n\n Or, if children aren\xe2\x80\x99t even real, and this existence is all a collective unconscious of incomprehensible nightmares, then just bring a canned good for $5 off your admission.\n\n\n In any case, bring as many children and canned goods as possible.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll need them later,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Civic Committee. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for anything to do with the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d they added. \xe2\x80\x9cFor something else. It\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise. Look, forget we said anything. We just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Civic Committee said from the loudspeakers recently mounted atop each of our homes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut definitely bring those kids and canned goods,\xe2\x80\x9d they added, which was then followed by a maniacal laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hey. This microphone is still on,\xe2\x80\x9d they concluded.\n\n\n Listeners? We\xe2\x80\x99re getting reports that there is a strange being in town. It arrived here quite suddenly, I assume, in a chariot from the sky with wheels of fire and the background hum of the cosmos taken corporeal form as its celestial force. Since I am a professional journalist, this is what I must assume. Or, maybe it just drove into town in a mid-priced sedan. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of ways to get here, and there are some ways you cannot.\n\n\n This stranger is interfering with our Destroy the Moon Festival, asking us things about the moon, and our intentions for its future; asking kind of bizarre things like, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you attempt to destroy the satellite designated the moon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Listeners, I know there are no dumb questions, just dumb realities, but even I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain that one.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m receiving varying reports about the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. It is: tall, with blue skin, bulging black eyes, and common human-like antennae. So, there are very few details that would make the stranger stand out from most people.\n\n\n Either way, keep a close eye out for strangers. And if you see someone you do not know, point and shout, \xe2\x80\x9cInterloper!\xe2\x80\x9d as is our friendly Night Vale custom.\n\n\n And now, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at traffic.\n\n\n Picture a dog. But with more scales, and less imbecile enthusiasm. And then some more scales. Ooh! And also a biomechanic forked tongue. Are you all picturing that?\n\n\n Now, picture that dog with horns. Great and terrible horns, curving ivory spirals stained with the slow-moving prey. Here, in your mind, breathing \xe2\x80\x93 not the crest and trough of inhales and exhales made by plain binary lungs, but a multi-stage gasp of air. In, in, in, out. In, in, out. Not so much a breath of life, but a whispered suggestion of something much, much worse.\n\n\n Picture this dog. Close your eyes, if you must, but you will see it either way. And it will see you either way.\n\n\n Are you picturing the dog? You are? Good.\n\n\n So, yeah. Um, maybe avoid unarmed travel on Route 800 between exits 10 and 13 today. This has been traffic.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsors.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is, um\xe2\x80\xa6oh, well I\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually heard of this brand, it is Patriot brand cigarettes. And of course, to represent them, popular celebrity spokes-being Deb, who is a sentient patch of haze.\n\n\n Deb: Well, hello there, Cecil!\n\n\n Cecil: Hi!\n\n\n Deb: How are things going with the moon?\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked. We have been trying and trying\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Deb: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\n\n\n Cecil: OK.\n\n\n Deb: It was a rhetorical question, like \xe2\x80\x9cdo you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is your social security number?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Cecil: Ohh. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m not very good at picking up on social cues.\n\n\n Deb: I am here on behalf of Patriot brand cigarettes. Listen, sure, cigarettes will give you cancer. Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99ll experience pain. Sure, a lot of pain. Sure, coughing. Sure, sadness. Sure, days spent looking from a bed that you can\xe2\x80\x99t leave to the neon glow of a sky that you can\xe2\x80\x99t help, through a window that you can\xe2\x80\x99t open. Sure. All of that, sure.\n\n\n But I \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a counter-point to that. It all just sounds like a bunch of human problems that don\xe2\x80\x99t really affect a sentient patch of haze. So just buy some Patriot brand cigarettes. What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst that could happen? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\n\n\n Cecil: Well, thank you, Deb. That sounds terrifying and deadly!\n\n\n Deb: Oh, gosh, Cecil! You know how to just flatter a sentient patch of haze.\n\n\n Cecil: Yeah.\n\n\n Deb: Goodbye, human.\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, OK.\n\n\n Well, the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival has hit on a few hitches. In addition to the terrifying outsider confusing everyone with questions about why we want to destroy that hideous, mocking rock, the festival attendees have been struggling to actually destroy the moon.\n\n\n They\xe2\x80\x99ve been throwing things at the moon for hours now. They\xe2\x80\x99ve tried common household rubbish, like coffee filters and pets, but those did very little to harm the moon. In fact, most of the objects simply arced and fell after only 20 feet or so, dropping uselessly to the earth we all know and distrust.\n\n\n Some of the citizens tried throwing the kids and canned goods, but no, no no. That\xe2\x80\x99s just incorrect.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThose things are for something else,\xe2\x80\x9d the Civic Committee reminded. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething that will come later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Save the kids and cans for that, listeners.\n\n\n But beside that, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what we throw, as none of it can seem to make it to even half as high as the moon, however high that thing is. \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno, sixty feet? At least?\xe2\x80\x9d say reputable and very cute scientists, whose turn it is to call me tonight, about\xe2\x80\xa6you know, seven, or six, yeah\xe2\x80\xa6anyway, scientists agree that the whole \xe2\x80\x9cthrowing things\xe2\x80\x9d plan is just not working. Actually, you know what? Call me at six. Carlos? Call me at six. Cool.\n\n\n Um, I have invited my friend, former intern and current all-powerful Night Vale mayor, Dana Cardinal, into the studio. Um, she\xe2\x80\x99s been out at the festival all day.\n\n\n So, Dana, tell us what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening?\n\n\n Dana: Thanks, Cecil. As you know, the Destroy the Moon Festival started slowly, but we should not worry. I talked to the Civic Committee, and throwing things was just the first plan. There are many others. The next plan is that we all should direct hurtful remarks at the moon. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold back. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll demonstrate.\n\n\n [Clears throat]\n\n\n Hey moon! Your glow is the death rattle to the breaking light of day! You symbolize all that is meek and obscured and radiant with shame. And also, you\xe2\x80\x99re just a big old dumbo on top of all that, you stupid piece of rock that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even escape orbit and float away forever into the forever away.\n\n\n Do you want to give it a try?\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, umm, OK.\n\n\n [Clears throat]\n\n\n I do not understand you or your history, and so I fear and detest you!\n\n\n Dana: Good! That was very good, Cecil.\n\n\n Cecil: Thank you.\n\n\n Dana: I really want to get the word out to everyone going to the festival today to be prepared to cast great insults at that ridiculous gray circle. Or half-circle. Or crescent shape or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever it is. Ugh! It\xe2\x80\x99s always changing! It\xe2\x80\x99s like, make up your mind, idiot!\n\n\n Cecil: Right? Totally!\n\n\n OK, listeners, um, you heard Dana, let\xe2\x80\x99s all practice. What I want you to do is imagine the moon is above you. Just imagine me holding up my hand right now. And now, imagine that my hand is the moon. And I want you to fill your lungs with air, the air that you take for granted, and shout an insult at the moon. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate you, moon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Crowd: I hate you, moon!\n\n\n Cecil: Great, now do it louder.\n\n\n Crowd: I hate you, moon!\n\n\n Cecil: Even louder!\n\n\n Crowd: I hate you, moon!\n\n\n Cecil: OK, that was great! Yeah!\n\n\n So, um, now imagine that my hand is down (which it is), and when you\xe2\x80\x99re in Mission Grove Park, that is what you should do. We are going to vanquish this foolish nocturnal glow orb once and for all.\n\n\n And while you silently continue to practice your shouting, I take you now to the weather.\n\n\n Steve Carlsberg: Excuse me! Cecil! Wait, stay where you are! Please!\n\n\n Cecil: No! No, no, no, no, no!\n\n\n Steve: Oh, yeah.\n\n\n Cecil: Do not come into my radio studio and interrupt important weather updates, Steve Carlsberg! You have destroyed the sanctity of my working environment.\n\n\n Steve: OK. Look, Cecil, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the Destroy the Moon festival, and I found out some things. Important things. Things that may be of interest to your listeners.\n\n\n Cecil: Dana, does it smell weird in here? It kind of smells weird, right?\n\n\n Steve: Look, contrary to what our science teachers have told us, Night Vale, the moon is a real thing. It is not 60 feet off the ground, but hundreds of thousands of miles away from us!\n\n\n Cecil: [Laughing] Oh, no you\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: In space!\n\n\n Cecil: I\xe2\x80\xa6I can\xe2\x80\x99t. [Cecil snorts]\n\n\n Steve: Yes! Yes! In fact, American astronauts have visited the moon several times!\n\n\n Look, look. I know most scientists will tell you that the moon is a universally shared dream. Scientists have long said that there\xe2\x80\x99s not really a moon there, and that no one is actually seeing a moon, but we all pretend that we do, because we are told from an early age that it is there.\n\n\n Astronomers believe the moon to be part of a cultural narrative, and\xe2\x80\xa6and if we stop believing there was a moon, it simply would no longer be there, not unlike what happened to the dinosaurs. But I found this heavily-charred, yet still-legible book.\n\n\n Dana: Steve? I think that book was supposed to be destroyed in last week\xe2\x80\x99s bimonthly library cleanse. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s safe to read.\n\n\n Steve: You\xe2\x80\x99re right, Dana, which is why I avoided reading most of it. Also, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t like looking directly at words. But this one last part? It stood out. Look here. Read this last line of the final chapter.\n\n\n Dana: \xe2\x80\x9cSo, in conclusion, the moon is totally real. You\xe2\x80\x99d better believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And then there\xe2\x80\x99s a winking smiley face with two finger guns on either side. Wow, Cecil, Steve may be onto something. This looks like real science!\n\n\n Carlos: 'Scuse me, I might be able to help better determine what is and isn\xe2\x80\x99t science, OK? Like, for instance, minivans? Science. Horses? Pure fiction.\n\n\n Cecil: Carlos! What are you doing here? No, wait\xe2\x80\xa6did you find your way back from that other desert world already?\n\n\n Carlos: No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just projecting myself here. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually a trick that Dana taught me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it for long, or physically interact with anything, though.\n\n\n Cecil: Aww.\n\n\n Cecil and Carlos: Dang.\n\n\n Dana: Right?\n\n\n Carlos: I felt that something very unusual and dangerous is about to happen, and I knew that Night Vale would need someone who knew what is and isn\xe2\x80\x99t science.\n\n\n Steve: But it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6all due respect, but it\xe2\x80\x99s in the book!\n\n\n Cecil: Anyone can write a book, Steve. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s true. Have you ever read A Hundred Years of Solitude? Not a single true thing in that book. Entirely made up. People are all like, \xe2\x80\x9cThis book is so good, like, such a classic of postmodern literature,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely lies! This is the problem with books, Steve! Lies!\n\n\n Croach: The book is correct.\n\n\n Cecil, Dana, and Steve: Interloper!\n\n\n Carlos: Oh, uh, right. Interloper!\n\n\n Cecil: No, Did you not see the ON AIR sign outside the door?\n\n\n Croach: I detected no such sign with any of my myriad senses.\n\n\n Steve: Yeah, me neither, with my seven of them.\n\n\n Dana: Me neither.\n\n\n Cecil: Well, I wrote right here on my to do list, um, \xe2\x80\x9cPut ON THE AIR sign above studio door.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Carlos: Cecil, is there a line through that item?\n\n\n Cecil: Noooo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Carlos: What about a check mark?\n\n\n Cecil: Uh, noooo\xe2\x80\xa6and I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at.\n\n\n Croach: Humans! I have come here to\xe2\x80\xa6to, uh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: Night Vale?\n\n\n Croach: Night Vale\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Carlos: Uh, sorry, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: That is what I said, Night Vale.\n\n\n Dana: Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: Please cease attempting to destroy the satellite designated the earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon, denizens of Night Vale.\n\n\n Cecil, Carlos, Steve, and Dana: Night Vale!\n\n\n Croach: Do you not know what the destruction of your single moon would do to your planet?\n\n\n Cecil: Pshh! Most likely nothing!\n\n\n Dana: Maybe even good things.\n\n\n Carlos: I know exactly what it would do, thank you very much. I mean, what is science but an exact knowledge of what the future holds, OK?\n\n\n Croach: Bagropa! Human, your teeth and hair are the finest teeth and hair I have ever encountered! No. No, second-finest. No, finest. First. No, you\xe2\x80\x93 you know, top two.\n\n\n Cecil: Yeah. Yeah. Right?\n\n\n Steve: Look, everybody, I\xe2\x80\x99d listen to this guy! He seems to understand things about space. He looks like a person that\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: Mmm. Not a person.\n\n\n Steve: OK, like a guy, then, who\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: No.\n\n\n Steve: Like a sentient entity that understands the careful balance of the cosmos. Where are you from, anyway, stranger?\n\n\n Croach: I am from G'loot Praktaw.\n\n\n Dana: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is.\n\n\n Croach: You designate it Mars.\n\n\n Cecil: Nope, still does not ring a bell.\n\n\n Steve: Never heard of it.\n\n\n Carlos: I am a scientist and so I, of course, know exactly whatever that place he said was, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Dana: Yeah, don\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\n\n\n Croach: I have come from Mars, and the future, to this time and place to relieve my onus and to save the moon of this planet. Who is this Civic Committee that has been planning to destroy your moon?\n\n\n Cecil: Nobody knows.\n\n\n Dana: Oh, I do.\n\n\n Cecil: Oh.\n\n\n Dana: I met them yesterday, a couple of really nice robots.\n\n\n Carlos: Robots? That is exciting!\n\n\n Croach: You possess robots in this place, in this time?\n\n\n Dana: Yeah, made of metal. Inexplicably filled with life and aimless sentience, like everybody else. Robots. Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re right over there!\n\n\n Claxon: That\xe2\x80\x99s right, blue skin! We are still in the future, standing with your endocrine system-having pal back on your red planet and we are also here in the past, fixin\xe2\x80\x99 to bring down the moon.\n\n\n Samuel: Yeah, we don\xe2\x80\x99t care about no moon!\n\n\n Claxon: Nope! I shot a moon of Pluto just to watch it die.\n\n\n Samuel: Folks are always excited about their moon, writin\xe2\x80\x99 poetry and understandin\xe2\x80\x99 the tides and paintin\xe2\x80\x99 pictures of a waning gibbous pseudo orb gently lighting a soft silver forest lining a crystalline lake as a family of deer peer out from the shadows of winter trees.\n\n\n Claxon: Yeah. And always goin\xe2\x80\x99 on about the way the clouds seem like a reflection of the moonlight, which is a reflection of the sunlight, which is a reflection of a history so distant it wisps away like clouds.\n\n\n Samuel: We do not like it.\n\n\n Dana: Wait, what did you need with the kids and canned goods?\n\n\n Samuel: Oh, we set up a kids craft fair near the festival and started a canned food drive for the needy.\n\n\n Claxon: There\xe2\x80\x99s also a bounce house.\n\n\n Samuel: Ooh, yeah, right, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bounce house too.\n\n\n Claxon: Should be fun for them and\xe2\x80\xa6and support a real good cause.\n\n\n Samuel: Adios!\n\n\n Cecil: Oh\xe2\x80\xa6OK.\n\n\n Carlos: My detector\xe2\x80\x99s telling me that those scientifically fascinating robots have left through time using a remote temporal shift beam. Just so you know.\n\n\n Croach: Without direct communication with the human Marshal designated Pemily Stallwark across time and space, I have no way to follow them.\n\n\n Cecil: No, wait, we have a radio tower. And that is for communicating.\n\n\n Dana: Or you could just use my temporal shift beam.\n\n\n Croach: You possess your own temporal shift beam?\n\n\n Dana: Um, everyone does. The City Council decriminalized time travel months ago.\n\n\n Croach: Then I shall pursue them. Oh, it is your device. Do you wish to come? I do not care to be under onus to a past being.\n\n\n Dana: I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent enough time moving weirdly through time and space. It was so-so. Not really my thing, so you boys go on ahead.\n\n\n Cecil: You know what? I\xe2\x80\x99ll join you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to know if the future was real, or an elaborate urban legend.\n\n\n Dana: Here, let me Just find my temporal shift beam. It\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in my bag, just\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Listeners? Stay tuned next for a digital sound effect, an empty stage, and several minutes of people moving about the theater to buy drinks and chat and use restrooms.\n\n\n And, as always: goodnight, Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: Night Vale.\n\n\n Steve: Incorrect.\n\n\n Dana: Oh, I found it!\n\n\n Cecil: Goodnight.\n\n\n [Beep]\n\n\n Joseph Fink: End of Side A. Please turn to Side B.\n\n\n Cecil: Ladies and gentlemen, and all betwixt, between, and beyond: we were so rudely interrupted by a disgrace to our decent\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: Hi, everyone!\n\n\n Cecil: Yes, him. We were interrupted before we could give you some important climate information, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m real sorry about that, Cecil.\n\n\n Cecil: Oh my goodness.\n\n\n Steve: I just\xe2\x80\xa6I had some important information to convey!\n\n\n Cecil: So, I take you all\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: I think it turned out OK, though. I mean, I said the information, and now that the whole moon business is really starting to heat up\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Yes.\n\n\n Steve: You know, uh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: As I was saying, listeners of every kind, I take you now\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: Oh-ho, this is my favorite part!\n\n\n Cecil: Steven Eugene Carlsberg! Please!\n\n\n I take you now to\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: Oh-ho-ho boy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait!\n\n\n Cecil: You know what? That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Forget it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no actual weather report for today. So\xe2\x80\xa6let\xe2\x80\x99s just jump right\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: No no no no no no no no, wait! I have a weather report!\n\n\n [Clears throat]\n\n\n \xe2\x99\xab Who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Flyin\xe2\x80\x99 at the speed of light? \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa Who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Full of might and out of sight? \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xab When Apex City\xe2\x80\x99s cursed by crime, \xe2\x99\xab\n\n\n Cecil: OK. No you\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n \xe2\x99\xaa He\xe2\x80\x99s on the scene in laser time! \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n Cecil: No, no, no, no, no, no. We\xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re done here.\n\n\n Steve: Okey doke. See ya! Hahahaha!\n\n\n Cecil: And now, a word from our sponsors. Today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is WorkJuice brand coffee.\n\n\n Now, for some reason, they sent us a script that was completely inappropriate for use in advertising, like\xe2\x80\xa6you should have seen this thing, it was bizarre! Honestly, I have never seen an ad quite like it. It was really\xe2\x80\xa6gross, and it talked about things like what the product does, and how to buy it.\n\n\n So I did them the favor of rewriting that obvious mistaken release and now it is a very effective ad, if I do say so myself.\n\n\n That preface aside, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear from WorkJuice.\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: It\xe2\x80\x99s an updated script. What is this? It\xe2\x80\x99s covered in\xe2\x80\xa6is this tar?\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: We\xe2\x80\x99re on!\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired after this long work day. If only there was some way of feeling more aware! More awake!\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: Well, have you tried\xe2\x80\xa6I can barely read this!\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: More awake! More of a human! More\xe2\x80\xa6me! Or\xe2\x80\xa6more mes. If the whole world was me, and we had no need to communicate, or fight, or work, or do anything but stand there and know what all the rest of us were thinking, because\xe2\x80\xa6we would all be thinking those things at the same time.\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: My fingers are burning!\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: Every once in a while one of us would smile in acknowledgement of what we were thinking, but only one of us. The rest of us would not need to smile, because that one single one of us would have done it for the rest of us. So we would all know that, and do nothing.\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: Does this even mention WorkJuice Coffee? You should drink WorkJuice Coffee!\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: That is mostly what we would do! Knowing and nothing, knowing and\xe2\x80\xa6nothing. And we would age, grow, and gray at the exact same rate and to the exact same height. And then, one day, we would all be gone. All at once. And no one would have to be sad, or miss anyone.\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: I can\xe2\x80\x99t move my arms. I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel my body! What is on this script?\n\n\n Will you touch me? Touch me, just\xe2\x80\xa6to let me know I am real?\n\n\n Ad-Man 1: Yes.\n\n\n WorkJuice brand coffee! Because we will, all of us, die together in one glorious moment.\n\n\n Ad-Man 2: My fingers! Where are my fingers? My\xe2\x80\xa6knees!\n\n\n S'tonge: It\xe2\x80\x99s me! S'tonge of the Galaxium! As an all-seeing cosmic entity, it\xe2\x80\x99s my blessing and curse to alone watch the universe \xe2\x80\x93 even the boring stuff \xe2\x80\x93 but not to do anything about it. Like, I can\xe2\x80\x99t create a mate out of nothing but space powers and loneliness to watch the universe with and talk to about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening out there. Nope! Because she will eventually leave when she discovers what I did.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave,\xe2\x80\x9d I know, \xe2\x80\x9cthanks to omniscience,\xe2\x80\x9d you may be saying.\n\n\n Well, you just proved y'all don\xe2\x80\x99t have omniscience. She would leave.\n\n\n When we last left our heroes, Earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon was disappearing. Two of Sparks Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s robot rogues were maybe to blame, and Croach the Tracker traveled through time and space to the root of the problem, the desert town of Night Vale.\n\n\n We now bring you Act 3 of the Great Thrilling Adventure Hour/Welcome to Night Vale Crossover, precisely where we left our Marshal, in the Marshal\xe2\x80\x99s Station.\n\n\n Sparks: \xe2\x80\xa6talk about your onus, when I get back, Croach, but for now\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada, I have returned.\n\n\n Sparks: From where?\n\n\n Croach: From the past.\n\n\n Sparks: You\xe2\x80\xa6moved?\n\n\n Pemily: Uh-huh. My deputy\xe2\x80\x99s chronal shifts are precise. Croach? Marshal Nevada didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know you was gone!\n\n\n Sparks: Did you pay extra for that?\n\n\n Pemily: \xe2\x80\xa6Little bit.\n\n\n Sparks: Little bit, yeah.\n\n\n Croach: I did not return under the power of the chronal shift of the deputy of the Marshal of the moon of the earth. I returned under the power of\xe2\x80\xa6bagropa! Where are the humans who accompanied me from the past?\n\n\n Sparks: Wait, you brought folk back with you? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you read the Handbook of USSA Time Travel Standards, Updated Edition?\n\n\n Croach: I disagreed strongly with the tone taken in the foreword.\n\n\n Sparks: You can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6ugh, Croach.\n\n\n Felton: Marshal! Heeellllp! Croach done caused a temporal paradox!\n\n\n Croach: I did not!\n\n\n Felton: You maybe did!\n\n\n Croach: I did not! Unless the denizens of Night Vale stopped to attempt to introduce the weather and initiate an advertisement in the middle of transport, thus losing them in time, in which case they caused at least one paradox.\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n And now they have un-caused it.\n\n\n Cecil: Um, it\xe2\x80\x99s pronounced Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: Night Vale.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said, Night Vale.\n\n\n Cecil: No, no, Night Vale. Like, use your mouth.\n\n\n Sparks: Use my mouth? I\xe2\x80\x99m us\xe2\x80\x93 OK. Night Vale.\n\n\n Carlos: Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: Night Vale.\n\n\n Sparks: Night Vale.\n\n\n Croach: Night Vale.\n\n\n Sparks: Night \xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Croach: Do not even bother, Sparks Nevada.\n\n\n Felton: Are you\xe2\x80\xa6from the past?\n\n\n Carlos: Yeah! Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t everything originate from the past?\n\n\n Felton: Can you reveal elements of the past?\n\n\n Cecil: I suppose.\n\n\n Felton: What\xe2\x80\x99s gonna have happened to me?\n\n\n Sparks: You know\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s not how it\xe2\x80\xa6all right\xe2\x80\xa6never mind, Felton.\n\n\n All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars. I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6from Earth.\n\n\n Steve: Same. Steve. Carlsberg.\n\n\n Sparks: No.\n\n\n Steve: With an E.\n\n\n Felton: With an E? J\xe2\x80\x93 Just one?\n\n\n Steve: What?\n\n\n Felton: What?\n\n\n Steve: What?\n\n\n Felton: What?\n\n\n Steve: Whats?\n\n\n Felton: What whats?\n\n\n Steve: What? What what? What?\n\n\n Felton: I already do not like this guy.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Carlos: Uh, if I may, I\xe2\x80\x99m Carlos. I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist.\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, a scientist. What, uh, what kind?\n\n\n Carlos: I, uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand?\n\n\n Sparks: Well, there are all kinds of\xe2\x80\xa6like, what sort of area\xe2\x80\xa6uh, we get a lot of mad scie\xe2\x80\x93 uh, like, what\xe2\x80\x99s your field of study, I guess?\n\n\n Carlos: Uhh, science.\n\n\n Sparks: Okey doke. And you?\n\n\n Cecil: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m Cecil Palmer, I\xe2\x80\x99m the host of Night Vale Community Radio.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah\xe2\x80\xa6Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is. Anyway, welcome to Mars.\n\n\n Cecil: Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is.\n\n\n Sparks: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Mars is?\n\n\n Carlos: Uh, I know exactly what it is. Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve, um, I\xe2\x80\x99ve written papers.\n\n\n Sparks: All right.\n\n\n Carlos: Um, not about, uh, whatever this place is\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: Mars.\n\n\n Carlos: \xe2\x80\xa6specifically, yeah, but\xe2\x80\xa6you know, still. Papers. About things.\n\n\n Sparks: OK, but you know it\xe2\x80\x99s a place.\n\n\n Claxon: It\xe2\x80\x99s a planet, you ignoramuses!\n\n\n Cecil: No, my very efficient City Council gave us nine prophecies\xe2\x80\xa6nope. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\n\n\n Samuel: Well, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t not one, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\n\n\n Dan: Well, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t wrong.\n\n\n Howdy! Nice Man Dan.\n\n\n Cecil: Ohh! You seem nice!\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, listen you\xe2\x80\xa6you all seem nice, all right? Cecil seems really nice here, but\xe2\x80\xa6you understand, I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to be in our time. You\xe2\x80\x99ve likely got past germs all over you, stuff we eradicated generations ago, like, uh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, help me out.\n\n\n Dan: Sinus infections\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: Si\xe2\x80\x93 yes, sure.\n\n\n Cecil: Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m battling Lyme disease.\n\n\n Sparks: What is that?\n\n\n Dan: You know Space Lyme disease?\n\n\n Sparks: Sure.\n\n\n Dan: Lyme disease is the past version of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m a history buff.\n\n\n Sparks: Oh.\n\n\n Carlos: Of diseases exclusively?\n\n\n Dan: And maladies. I made a diorama I called Germs: Then and Now. If anyone wants to see a diorama.\n\n\n Steve: All right, just\xe2\x80\xa6hold up, all right? Now, how do we know that you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t all have future germs? You know, like, stuff we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know about? Little robots the size of your cells, that flow through your blood stream like teeny tiny construction workers\xe2\x80\xa6itus? That\xe2\x80\x99s probably what they call it? I bet?\n\n\n Croach: It is designated Nah Nohtek, and it exists within all of the glorious people, and it is glorious.\n\n\n Steve: I was right?\n\n\n Cecil: Yes, shut up, Steve Carlsberg. Nobody asked you, and nobody ever will.\n\n\n Croach: I possess no affection for the human designated Steve Carlsberg.\n\n\n Steve: I can hear you\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Yes!\n\n\n Steve: \xe2\x80\xa6buddy!\n\n\n Croach: I am not your buddy.\n\n\n Pemily: Hey, hey, everyone? Moon\xe2\x80\x99s still disappearing. Catastrophe ain\xe2\x80\x99t averted!\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, my gosh. This is embarrassing.\n\n\n Steve: It\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault.\n\n\n Croach: It is somewhat your fault.\n\n\n Carlos: Mostly it\xe2\x80\x99s the scientifically fascinating robot\xe2\x80\x99s fault!\n\n\n Samuel: Are you pointin\xe2\x80\x99 keratin fingernails and their friends fingers at us, intimatin\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99re disappearing the moon, while simultaneously rubbin\xe2\x80\x99 in the fact that I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no fingers\xe2\x80\x99 pal\xe2\x80\x99s hands, due to the Marshal shootin\xe2\x80\x99 'em off me?\n\n\n Pemily: If it\xe2\x80\x99s their fault, reckon I know who to shake until they stop wreckin\xe2\x80\x99 my moon!\n\n\n Sparks: All right, no no no no. I\xe2\x80\x99m handling this, Marshal.\n\n\n Pemily: My moon\xe2\x80\x99s in peril, Marshal!\n\n\n Sparks: And I\xe2\x80\x99m taking care of it, Marshal.\n\n\n Pemily: Not yet you\xe2\x80\x99re not! We\xe2\x80\x99re streaming ourselves over, Marshal!\n\n\n Sparks: No, don\xe2\x80\x99t come here! It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be too crowded\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Pemily: Initiate a stream, Deputy County!\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n Delores County: Howdy, everyone. Deputy Delores County.\n\n\n Sparks: Howdy.\n\n\n Delores: I am a cyborg, howdy. Deputy Delores County, from the moon, howdy.\n\n\n Claxon: Pleasure.\n\n\n Samuel: Pleasure.\n\n\n Croach: Howdy.\n\n\n Delores: Deputy Delores County, hello. Nice to meet you. Deputy Delores County, cyborg from the moon\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n [everyone calling out greetings]\n\n\n Delores: Delores County, moon.\n\n\n Pemily: Yeah, they got it. All right.\n\n\n Whoo! It\xe2\x80\x99s crowded in here, Marshal! Our Marshal Station on the moon is, uh, way roomier.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, well you ain\xe2\x80\x99t probably got Martians, local folk, robot outlaws, time travelers, cyborgs, and Moon Marshals crowdin\xe2\x80\x99 it up.\n\n\n Pemily: Uh-huh. Uh, yeah, we got one fewer, one fewer, uh, three fewer, two fewer, and\xe2\x80\xa6same, and same. Round thereabouts.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah.\n\n\n Dan: Tell you what, it is feelin\xe2\x80\x99 crowded, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t see what I\xe2\x80\x99m adding to this situation, nor what Felton adds\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Felton: Hey!\n\n\n Dan: So, uh, well, what say I take him for a drink at the saloon? That\xe2\x80\x99d be two of us out of your hair.\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, I cannot stay mad at you, Nice Man Dan!\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, now Dr. Carlos is saying it\xe2\x80\x99s these robots to blame for the earth moon falling apart, right?\n\n\n Cecil: Well, you see, in Night Vale, a Civic Committee for Public Holidays and Private Silent Weeping for No Reason You Can Name was formed, and they sponsored the First Annual Destroy the Moon Festival.\n\n\n Sparks: Destroy the moon? What, with like, bombs?\n\n\n Cecil: Nooo\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: A really big\xe2\x80\xa6really big gun?\n\n\n Carlos: Uh, eh\xe2\x80\xa6not exactly.\n\n\n Sparks: A bunch of\xe2\x80\xa6really small guns? How\xe2\x80\x99re we doin\xe2\x80\x99 this?\n\n\n Cecil: Um, well? We threw things at it.\n\n\n Pemily: Huh. I\xe2\x80\x99m from the moon, fella, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that could destroy it.\n\n\n Cecil: Ooh! Uh, we also called it names.\n\n\n Steve: And\xe2\x80\xa6and we generally insulted it.\n\n\n Cecil: Mmm-hmm.\n\n\n Pemily: That ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna destroy my moon neither.\n\n\n Sparks: And that don\xe2\x80\x99t explain why we hold these two responsible.\n\n\n Claxon: With your fingers! Insult to injury.\n\n\n Cecil: Well, these two robots were the aforementioned Civic Committee.\n\n\n Sparks: Wait a sec. How is that even possible?\n\n\n Samuel: That ain\xe2\x80\x99t possible!\n\n\n Carlos: Everything ain\xe2\x80\x99t ain\xe2\x80\x99t possible always. Possibility is manifest in every corner of the void of our reality.\n\n\n Claxon: I ain\xe2\x80\x99t in the past! I\xe2\x80\x99m here. Where I am.\n\n\n Samuel: Yeah, me too! Maybe even more'n him! We don\xe2\x80\x99t even have the means to time travel, let alone knowin\xe2\x80\x99 what to do when we get there.\n\n\n Carlos: I mean, you could have stolen someone else\xe2\x80\x99s personal temporal shift beam generators.\n\n\n Cecil: Yeah, sure, they\xe2\x80\x99re everywhere. I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one here in my fanny pack.\n\n\n Delores: Now what\xe2\x80\x99s that, an external fanny pack?\n\n\n Cecil: Wait\xe2\x80\xa6you have an internal one?\n\n\n Delores: Yeah. Cyborg\xe2\x80\xa6so, uh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Oh. That must be nice.\n\n\n Delores: Hey, yours is nice, too. Probably easier to access, and colorful. I like it.\n\n\n Cecil: Thank you.\n\n\n Carlos: I tell him he looks like a baby boomer mom out on a cruise vacation.\n\n\n Croach: All right.\n\n\n Pemily: If you say so.\n\n\n Delores: Whatever rocks your boat.\n\n\n Sparks: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, cadence and all, it sounds like a contemporary reference. It is lost on us.\n\n\n Claxon: Well, the fact it\xe2\x80\x99s on the outside of you, just danglin\xe2\x80\x99 a temporal shift generator in there means it is ripe for the stealin\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\n [Brief sound of a struggle]\n\n\n Or would be, for somebody with the hands to do it.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any.\n\n\n Samuel: I got hands. Watch!\n\n\n [Briefer sound of a fanny pack unclipping]\n\n\n Cecil: No! My fanny pack!\n\n\n [Unzipping sound]\n\n\n Samuel: Here we go!\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n Sparks: What\xe2\x80\xa6happened?\n\n\n Pemily: They\xe2\x80\x99re still here.\n\n\n Samuel: Uh, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t. We\xe2\x80\x99re back.\n\n\n Claxon: Ain\xe2\x80\x99t never thought settin\xe2\x80\x99 up a Civic Committee could be such a laugh! Remember that one fella?\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOoh, my name is Hiram McDaniels! Ooh, I\xe2\x80\x99m a five-headed dragon and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got plans for Night Vale too! Heh-heh-heh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Cecil: You know, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he sounds like.\n\n\n Samuel: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him join, for obvious reasons.\n\n\n Claxon: That one head.\n\n\n Samuel: Ugh. So we all was right. We set in motion events to disappear the moon. And that ain\xe2\x80\x99t all.\n\n\n Claxon: Bye-bye, Marshal!\n\n\n Sparks: Bye-bye Mar\xe2\x80\x93 me?\n\n\n Claxon: No!\n\n\n Pemily: Hey! Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m disappearing!\n\n\n Delores: Marshal Stallwark!\n\n\n Pemily: Wh\xe2\x80\x93 what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to me?\n\n\n Claxon: Oh, we made some adjustments to the timeline. Capriciously, I admit, but, uh, we just wanted to see if'n they\xe2\x80\x99d take.\n\n\n Samuel: We fixed it so\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer the winner of the lottery-filled bloodsport in which you made your name: beating the caste system by being the last kid standing in a lethal game of intramural soccer.\n\n\n Pemily: But\xe2\x80\xa6but if'n I didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the punishment soccer, then that means I\xe2\x80\xa6I lost. I died.\n\n\n Claxon: Bye, little human with girl chromosomes!\n\n\n Pemily: Now I remember. Lucky side tackle Jessica! [Coughs] Nice having known you, Nevada. Croach. Only I\xe2\x80\xa6I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n [Pemily fades in a sound of chimes]\n\n\n Sparks: All right, you two are super under arrest. Time crimes ain\xe2\x80\x99t misdemeanors.\n\n\n Cecil: Actually, in Night Vale, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been downgraded to infractions.\n\n\n Sparks: Infractions?\n\n\n Cecil: They were barely worth the citation for most meter readers.\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n Sparks: Ohh!\n\n\n Samuel: And we\xe2\x80\x99re back!\n\n\n Sparks: Now what?\n\n\n Claxon: See how I\xe2\x80\x99m wavin\xe2\x80\x99 at you, Nevady?\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah.\n\n\n Claxon: I got my hands back!\n\n\n Samuel: Yeah, hey! Hey! [laughs] I got one. We should, uh, [whispers]\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Claxon: Oh! Good one!\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n Samuel: [Maniacal laughter]\n\n\n Cecil: Oh my!\n\n\n Sparks: Oh no! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, did they kill you too?\n\n\n Cecil: No, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to bowl anymore! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what bowling is!\n\n\n You monsters!\n\n\n Claxon: Sam Bolt? What you want to do to Nevady?\n\n\n Sparks: All right, not so fast. Citizens of Night Vale have temporal shift generators, right?\n\n\n Cecil: Um, Night Vale. And yes.\n\n\n Sparks: All right. Give me yours, Steve Carlsberg.\n\n\n Steve: Uh, I\xe2\x80\xa6I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n Cecil: Give it to him, Steve Carlsberg!\n\n\n Steve: No, no no, I\xe2\x80\x93 I want to, but I always misplace it, so I left it at home for safe keeping.\n\n\n All: Oh, Steve Carlsberg!\n\n\n Sparks: Carlsberg!\n\n\n Delores: Enough! All right, I am still here, and without Marshal Stallwark having lived to be my boss, I am an ornery cuss.\n\n\n Sparks: And why is that?\n\n\n Delores: You want me to explain the particulars of the space time continuity, or you want me to show you what it means?\n\n\n Sparks: Uhhhhhhhhhh\xe2\x80\xa6.honestly?\n\n\n Delores: Suffice it to say, Chicky Sulliman won a real big star war, and he\xe2\x80\x99s currently emperor of the universe, and I expect the only reason you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a cyborg right now is he likes you.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, OK, one thing at a time.\n\n\n Claxon: Space time continuity makes my head hurt.\n\n\n Samuel: Yeah. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what y'all are talking about, and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t interested in learning about it nor discussin\xe2\x80\x99 it any further.\n\n\n Reckon I only aim to shoot this deputy for confusing everything somethin\xe2\x80\x99 powerful.\n\n\n Delores: Go ahead and try.\n\n\n Samuel: My guns! Where\xe2\x80\x99d they get to?\n\n\n Delores: Oh, they got to me destroyin\xe2\x80\x99 them. I got my own time travel tech can\xe2\x80\x99t be stolen nor destroyed, seein\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s part of me.\n\n\n Claxon: We didn\xe2\x80\x99t even hear you shift!\n\n\n Delores: Had it set to silent.\n\n\n Sparks: Silent.\n\n\n Delores: You see, without balance brought by the things that were, I shifted forward in time a ways to upgrade my intelligence and system ops.\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what one thing has to do with the other.\n\n\n Delores: You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n\n Sparks: Mean.\n\n\n Carlos: Um, if I may, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about balance out of balance, going to\xe2\x80\xa6you know, she who seeks balance for herself.\n\n\n Delores: That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right! Sometimes it takes a past man to tell a future man the present.\n\n\n Cecil: I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it better myself! And if I could have, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, because it would have been illegal to do so.\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n Samuel: Well, I aim to shift to before you did it and\xe2\x80\xa6[grunts] why ain\xe2\x80\x99t my shifter workin\xe2\x80\x99?\n\n\n Delores: Bustin\xe2\x80\x99 up your guns and time shifter ain\xe2\x80\x99t all I did.\n\n\n Cecil: Hey! Bowling! Yes! I remember it, and I love it!\n\n\n [Piano plays as Pemily returns]\n\n\n Pemily: There was\xe2\x80\xa6darkness. Nothin\xe2\x80\x99. And\xe2\x80\xa6numbers. I remember an endless stream of random numbers.\n\n\n \xe2\x99\xab I am a\xe2\x80\xa6champion, \xe2\x99\xab \xe2\x99\xaa and\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna hear me roar! \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n\n Sparks: All right, Marshal Stallwark. Let\xe2\x80\x99s shut these robots down, permanently.\n\n\n Delores: Not yet, Marshal.\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n Delores: We destroy them now, and the moon\xe2\x80\x99ll just keep on disappearin\xe2\x80\x99. They ain\xe2\x80\x99t who caused its destruction. Nor is it the people of Night Vale.\n\n\n Cecil: Are you sure? Because our insults were very cutting.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, what is it, Deputy? What\xe2\x80\x99s causing the moon to disappear?\n\n\n Delores: Well, me. Paradox due to undoin\xe2\x80\x99 what I undone but still have the upgrades caused by the undone things havin\xe2\x80\x99 been done. [Coughs]\n\n\n Uh-oh. Ugh. Now that the balance is being restored, I\xe2\x80\x99m becoming the fulcrum of the paradox. Along with the moon.\n\n\n Cecil: Two fulcrums?\n\n\n Delores: Because I\xe2\x80\x99m from the moon.\n\n\n Cecil: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\n\n\n Carlos: That has the shape and sound of science, I am sure it all makes sense and anyone listening would recognize it as a completely logical explanation.\n\n\n Felton: Marshal! Marshal! Heeelllp!\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Felton: Nice Man Dan and I were over drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 at the space saloon. An alarm went off due to the situation on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon, causing a galaxy-wide domino effect! Not nearly as fun as an actual game of dominoes! But very far! Throughout the galaxy! Balance [audience member sneezes] and\xe2\x80\xa6Bless you! And\xe2\x80\xa6Balance and order are canceled!\n\n\n Dan: Looks like the end times. Gotta say, when I thought of dyin\xe2\x80\x99, I always knew it\xe2\x80\x99d be something like this.\n\n\n Cecil: You always knew it would be due to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon disappearing and causing intergalactic turmoil?\n\n\n Dan: Yup.\n\n\n Cecil: Me too!\n\n\n Sparks: Well, I guess if'n this is really the end, then\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be surrounded by all y'all. 'Cept you two.\n\n\n Steve: Oh, come on, we just met!\n\n\n Sparks: I was talking about the robots, but yeah, you three.\n\n\n Carlos: Hey, uh, Cecil? If this is the last conversation we have, then let\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6not have it. I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s just remember every conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in our lives, going back.\n\n\n Cecil: I remember every one.\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada, it pains me that I shall perish while still under onus to you.\n\n\n Sparks: Consider it a wash.\n\n\n Croach: I cannot. That is not how onus works.\n\n\n Sparks: Croach? Your onus to me would be fulfilled if you\xe2\x80\x99d agree that servin\xe2\x80\x99 together had been one adventure after another.\n\n\n Croach: I agree to that.\n\n\n Sparks: And, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been, and\xe2\x80\xa6well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been and are my\xe2\x80\xa6just my total\xe2\x80\xa6my\xe2\x80\xa6my best\xe2\x80\xa6ffffff\xe2\x80\xa6you are my\xe2\x80\xa6best fff\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: Your best what, Sparks Nevada?\n\n\n Sparks: I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it. Umm. You are\xe2\x80\xa6my\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Steve: You\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend, Cecil!\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n Cecil: Wait, me? Really?\n\n\n Carlos: Him?\n\n\n Steve: Well\xe2\x80\xa6well, yeah.\n\n\n Cecil: I\xe2\x80\x93 Oh! I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Sparks: All right. No no no, Croach, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that\xe2\x80\xa6that is to say, Croach, you are\xe2\x80\xa6you are my best\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: What are you expressing, Sparks Nevada?\n\n\n Pemily: Deputy, you\xe2\x80\x99re my best friend!\n\n\n Delores: Oh, and you\xe2\x80\x99re mine too, Pem!\n\n\n Sparks: No, hang on!\n\n\n Pemily: I love you!\n\n\n Delores: I love you!\n\n\n Sparks: OK, let\xe2\x80\x99s not\xe2\x80\xa6OK. Croach, I just\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: Sparks Nevada. I possess a single emotion. And it is known as\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n [Sound of materialization]\n\n\n S'tonge: Hello! I am S'tonge. Of the Galaxium?\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, thank goodness.\n\n\n S'tonge: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening with this great crossover, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t just watch any longer.\n\n\n Cecil: You\xe2\x80\x99ve just been hanging out, watching our world about to end?\n\n\n S'tonge: I am of the Galaxium. We\xe2\x80\x99re a timeless, and comics \xe2\x80\x93 cosmically-powered race. Comically, too. Cosmically comically-powered race. We are forbidden to interfere with the events of the universe.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, well, I un-forbid you. It totally ain\xe2\x80\x99t against the law.\n\n\n S'tonge: No, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s more of an infraction.\n\n\n Sparks: Infraction?\n\n\n Pemily: Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m feelin\xe2\x80\x99 a whole lot of bloodlust towards this guy. Think I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna shoot him.\n\n\n Delores: Don\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\xa6I know S'tonge of the Galaxium due to all my upgrades that are killing me, the moon, and everything.\n\n\n S'tonge, you have the force galactic, the cosmic energies that make up the makeup of everything.\n\n\n S'tonge: Yup. But I am unallowed to use them. As I said. Apparently I\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to repeat myself.\n\n\n Delores: But\xe2\x80\xa6you could do it, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you? You could defy your\xe2\x80\xa6what, law?\n\n\n S'tonge: More of a local ordinance.\n\n\n Sparks: All right, well, then do it. Yeah, do it. Defy the heck out of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take what comes.\n\n\n S'tonge: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Um, S'tonge, is it?\n\n\n S'tonge: S'tonge? You pronounced my name correctly!\n\n\n Cecil: Yes. S'tonge, now, if you can help us, do! We need you to. We humans and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Croach: [Clears throat] I have simulated the clearing of the single human esophageal tract to draw attention to the fact that I am not human.\n\n\n Samuel: Uh, us neither.\n\n\n Cecil: Uh, of course. Um, beings, then. We beings really like\xe2\x80\xa6well, being. Um, it\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s right in the name.\n\n\n Pemily: I\xe2\x80\x99ve tasted enough death today, let alone in my life. I don\xe2\x80\x99t welcome no more.\n\n\n Steve: Yeah, without living, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no friendship.\n\n\n Carlos: No love.\n\n\n Cecil: No bowling.\n\n\n Sparks: No paperwork.\n\n\n Croach: No Sparks Nevada.\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n S'tonge: You beings, I am moved. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been moved.\n\n\n Felton: So you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it? You\xe2\x80\x99ll help us?\n\n\n S'tonge: I am moved by Sparks Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s bravery.\n\n\n Sparks: You\xe2\x80\xa6are welcome.\n\n\n S'tonge: By Cecil Gershwin Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\n\n\n Cecil: Thank you, and there is quite a bit of blood in it\xe2\x80\xa6um, more than I am comfortable admitting.\n\n\n Sparks: I also got heart, so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n S'tonge: Not as much.\n\n\n Sparks: Definitely as much.\n\n\n S'tonge: More bravery. Definitely more bravery than heart.\n\n\n Sparks: Disagree.\n\n\n S'tonge: I\xe2\x80\x99m moved by the tenacity of Pemily Stallwark, by the science of Carlos the Scientist. By the skepticism of Steve Carlsberg. By the nice\xc2\xa0of Nice Man Dan.\n\n\n Dan: You ain\xe2\x80\x99t so bad yourself.\n\n\n S'tonge: By your healthy fear, Felton.\n\n\n Felton: Thanks.\n\n\n S'tonge: And by the funny orneriness of this one robot.\n\n\n Claxon: D'aww, shut up.\n\n\n S'tonge: By the fact that this other one is a really good drummer.\n\n\n Claxon: You are? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know!\n\n\n Samuel: Well\xe2\x80\xa6y\xe2\x80\x93 you never asked.\n\n\n S'tonge: By your beauty, Delores County.\n\n\n Delores: Beauty? Really?\n\n\n S'tonge: You may be the most beautiful creature in the galaxy.\n\n\n Delores: Ugh. Yeah, I mean, thanks, I guess. Heap of other qualities by which I choose to define myself, but, uh, you choose my looks. That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6tellin\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\n S'tonge: It is my desire that you become my cosmic bride.\n\n\n Delores: This is sudden.\n\n\n S'tonge: Not to me.\n\n\n Sparks: It is, uh\xe2\x80\xa6it is pretty sudden.\n\n\n Delores: S'tonge, if I decline\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n S'tonge: I definitely won\xe2\x80\x99t save your universe.\n\n\n All: [general groans of protest mixed with encouraging Delores to say yes]\n\n\n Delores: Now\xe2\x80\xa6now, if'n you wanted to save everything so we could date a bit, see how things go, well, I\xe2\x80\x99d be up for that.\n\n\n S'tonge: Will you marry me, and have a universe? Yes or no?\n\n\n Sparks: Um, say yes. That is my advice. Say yes.\n\n\n Delores: Well now, you\xe2\x80\x99re omniscient, you already know my answer.\n\n\n Sparks: Is it yes? Is it? Is it yes?\n\n\n S'tonge: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, actually. I\xe2\x80\x99m being respectful. Laying a solid groundwork for this relationship.\n\n\n Delores: By blackmailing me with the fate of the universe?\n\n\n S'tonge: By not peeking.\n\n\n Delores: The answer\xe2\x80\xa6is\xe2\x80\xa6no.\n\n\n S'tonge: Fine. Have a good end of the universe, you guys.\n\n\n Sparks: Seriously?\n\n\n Sparks: That ended poorly.\n\n\n Steve: What was wrong with that guy?\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, that was bad.\n\n\n Steve: I mean\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Delores: Love is what was wrong with him.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, the bad kind of love. How long anyone reckon we got?\n\n\n Claxon: End\xe2\x80\x99s startin\xe2\x80\x99. My ocular sensors are telling me the moon\xe2\x80\x99s nearly gone.\n\n\n Pemily: Oh, dumb old time travelin\xe2\x80\x99! Nothin\xe2\x80\x99 good never came from it.\n\n\n Sparks and Cecil: Wait\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Claxon and Steve: What [is it]?\n\n\n Sparks: If'n too much time travel caused this disaster\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: Then it stands to reason that we can fix it the same way.\n\n\n Croach: That is unsound reasoning.\n\n\n Carlos: Yeah. And that makes no scientific sense.\n\n\n Cecil: No, listen, it does!\n\n\n Sparks: It does. We still got time travel in our pocket, or Deputy County\xe2\x80\x99s, more specifically.\n\n\n Cecil: She can go back!\n\n\n Delores: Yeah, but if I go back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll destroy everything!\n\n\n Sparks: Unless you go to before this all happened\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Cecil: And stop it all from ever happening.\n\n\n [Sound of two palms slapping together]\n\n\n Cecil: That was my very first high five!\n\n\n Sparks: Well, you are great at it.\n\n\n Cecil: Thank you!\n\n\n Steve: Wait, wait, wait! If that happens, then none of us would ever have met!\n\n\n Cecil: I am 100% OK with that. [Perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9cNo offense\xe2\x80\x9d under his breath \xe2\x80\x93 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it but it works with Sparks\xe2\x80\x99 next line.]\n\n\n Sparks: None taken. All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it. And by \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean \xe2\x80\x9cyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Delores: Yeah. Yeah, I think I can do that. But\xe2\x80\xa6I may never come back. Marshal Stallwark, may I tender my resignation?\n\n\n Carlos: Guys! This won\xe2\x80\x99t work, according to science, OK? If no one\xe2\x80\x99s going to listen to science, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to project myself back into the Otherworld desert dimension, where I live. OK? Good luck, Delores. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. Cyborgs are always fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you again soon, Cecil.\n\n\n Cecil: All right. I love you.\n\n\n Carlos: I love you, too.\n\n\n Pemily: I, uh, I\xe2\x80\xa6accept your resignation, deputy.\n\n\n Delores: Love you too, boss.\n\n\n Croach: And I\xe2\x80\xa6lo\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Sparks: Save it. Yup.\n\n\n Cecil? It\xe2\x80\x99s been interesting getting to meet you. You got a soothing voice, and I think that helped folk. Also, you got a lot of heart.\n\n\n Cecil: Well, tha\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Sparks: Not as much as me, but you got plenty of heart.\n\n\n Cecil: And this was all like being in a western! You know, I also love every film that Lee Marvin has made. Howdy adios Marshal! Howdy adios.\n\n\n Sparks: What? Those are two tot\xe2\x80\x93 All right. Bye.\n\n\n Delores: Diverting power\xe2\x80\xa6to do this. Won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6be\xe2\x80\xa6silent.\n\n\n [Sound of time travel stuff happening]\n\n\n Sparks: Felton! What kind of trouble?\n\n\n Felton: What kind of trouble? The worst kind! Robot outlaws! Also a human who ain\xe2\x80\x99t a robot, but who is an outlaw. I runned out soon as they started talking about gunnin\xe2\x80\x99 for you, Marshal! So\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99d have enough time to prepare yourself for their eventual arrival here! At\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Claxon: Which one of you flesh and bone and blood and nerves and organs-havin\xe2\x80\x99 so-and-sos is Sparks Nevady, Marshal on Mars?\n\n\n [Sound of something violent happening, accompanied by screams of surprise and pain from Claxon and Samuel]\n\n\n Dan: Well, there you go. I lured these robot outlaws here to be destroyed for the bounty.\n\n\n Sparks: So\xe2\x80\xa6wait, you two are working together?\n\n\n Delores: I come from a possible future, Marshal Nevada. And now I have prevented that future.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna take that at face value.\n\n\n Dan: So you ain\xe2\x80\x99t interested in the bounty?\n\n\n Delores: Then the bounty\xe2\x80\x99s mine! Use it to open up a shoe business, I reckon.\n\n\n Sparks: All right! I\xe2\x80\x99ll fill out the paperwork. Credit should be in your account by end of business today.\n\n\n Marshal Station AI: The Marshal Station doors are open.\n\n\n Croach: I also will leave.\n\n\n Sparks: For good, then?\n\n\n Croach: Yes. I shall depart. Unless you are somehow responsible for the cyborg having prevented a destructive future.\n\n\n Sparks: I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\n\n\n Delores: Um, you kind of were.\n\n\n Sparks: Uh, no, uh, uh, no. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that destructive of a future.\n\n\n Delores: Ehh, universe-ending level destructive.\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you did most of the work.\n\n\n Delores: Based on your idea!\n\n\n Sparks: Oh, come on!\n\n\n Croach: Then I am under great onus to you, Sparks Nevada. I will discern just how great via an accounting of what occurred.\n\n\n Delores: [Sigh] And then afterwards, reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the moon and resume deputying. Except\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s another me doing my job. The\xc2\xa0me that never left. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna start paradoxing again. Ugh. If I could do anything, what would I do?\n\n\n Sparks: Hmm.\n\n\n Delores: Shoe maker!\n\n\n Sparks: What?\n\n\n Delores: What? Where\xe2\x80\x99d that come from?\n\n\n Sparks: You know, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Nice Man Dan did before, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s liable to do again.\n\n\n Delores: Nice Man Dan, huh?\n\n\n Sparks: Yeah.\n\n\n Delores: He\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Real nice.\n\n\n S'tonge: Nice Man Dan, huh? She winds up with Nice Man Dan? Makin\xe2\x80\x99 shoes? Fine.\n\n\n And is this the end of Sparks Nevada? Has he endured a visit from past persons only to find the timeline unchanged?\n\n\n Well, guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just keep watching and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Colonel Tick-Tock: Wait, darling!\n\n\n S'tonge: Colonel Tick-Tock, bulwark of Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Royal Chronal Patrol!\n\n\n Cecil: And me, Cecil Palmer!\n\n\n Dana: And me, mayor of Night Vale, Dana Cardinal.\n\n\n Tick-Tock: Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s timeline has been driven dangerously weird, S'tonge. And only the four of us can repair it.\n\n\n Cecil: And we know weird.\n\n\n Dana: I;m basically the mayor of weird.\n\n\n S'tonge: But\xe2\x80\xa6but why are y'all here? What happens in this timeline? Do I become a giant jerk or something?\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, not you, S'tonge. It\xe2\x80\x99s your kids! Something must be done about your kids!\n\n\n S'tonge: What about 'em?\n\n\n Cecil: You\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to have any!\n\n\n Dana: It could ruin everything!\n\n\n Tick-Tock: You must end up alone and bitter!\n\n\n S'tonge: Great! Then let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\n\n\n Wait\xe2\x80\xa6where\xe2\x80\x99s your trick clock?\n\n\n Tick-Tock: Trick clock?
