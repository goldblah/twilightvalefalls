Episode 86 - Standing and Breathing
b"I believe the children are our\nfuture. They are also our past and our present. This is how children\nwork in linear time.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Mayor Dana Cardinal announced that\nlast night\xe2\x80\x99s air raid sirens were nothing to be alarmed by. Nor are\nthe missing street and highway signs, nor are the angry people who\nwere assigned to hold the signs and wave them about, using the\nmaritime telegraphic language of semaphore, and who are now standing\naround dumbfounded and empty-handed. Nor should we yet concern\nourselves with mailboxes, which have all been filled with what postal\nworkers hope is just hair\ngel.\n\n Following\na meeting with the sheriff and the City Council, Mayor Cardinal says\nshe believes this all to be the work of pranksters \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps the\nreturn of the feral dogs, who once defaced several concrete walls\nwith libertarian street art \xe2\x80\x93 but the mayor and the Secret Police\nare not ruling out more sinister activity.\n\n Sheriff\nSam added, while whittling a piece of balsa into a polar bear, that\nit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely these foreigners, moving here from Desert Bluffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nCity Council said nothing. They mostly stood around behind the press\nconference podium texting and giggling. All of them had fresh\nhaircuts, crisp upturned polo collars, and manicures.\n\n The\nmayor said she would work closely with Sheriff Sam to find the\nculprits, but in the meantime, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for alarm.\n\n Sam\nadded that there was a need to remove all the foreigners.\n\n More\non this story as it develops.\n\n But\nfirst, an update on the trial of Hiram McDaniels. Unable to find a\njury of peers for a literal five-headed dragon, the court agreed to\ncreate artificial intelligence to simulate what five-headed dragon\npeers would be like, and then place that A.I. on the jury. For this\nproject, they hired expert computer programmer Melony Pennington, who\njoins us now by phone.\n\n Welcome\nto my show, Melony!\n\n Melony:\nWelcome to your show! I mean hi, hello. It turns out you welcomed me,\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to welcome you. Sorry, my mind was, you know,\nthe expanse. The vast. The out there. I mean my mind is elsewhere. My\nmind is everywhere.\n\n Cecil:\nWonderful! And how are you\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Melony:\nDo you ever look at the stars? The stars. You know, the stars. Not\neach star, but some of\nthe stars. I mean every single one of the stars at once. I mean the\nwhole night sky added up. Do you ever look at the sum of the stars?\nThe night sky, as an equation? Beauty as a math problem? Which it is\n\xe2\x80\x93 everything beautiful is math. Everything beautiful is a problem.\n\n What\nwas your question?\n\n Cecil:\nUmm, how are you doing?\n\n Melony:\nOh. I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\n\n Cecil:\nMelony, you sound familiar.\n\n Melony:\nDo I sound familiar? You just said that, so I guess I do. You must\nhave met one of my programs\xe2\x80\xa6or not met,\nnone of them are sentient. You can\xe2\x80\x99t meet things that have no\nsentience. Well, I guess you could be like, \xe2\x80\x9cHi there, pile of\nrocks, I\xe2\x80\x99m Melony,\xe2\x80\x9d just to see what happens. I suppose there is no\nset dogma for social engagement.\n\n Oh,\nI wish I had a dog.\n\n Have you ever met a rock?\n\n What\xe2\x80\x99s\nyour name again?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, mmm\xe2\x80\xa6I'm\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Melony:\nWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I probably sound familiar because all of my\nprograms have the same voice as me. That\xe2\x80\x99s how computer programming\nworks.\n\n Cecil:\nHave you ever programmed a computer that broadcasts on a radio\nstation, specifically one that recites random numbers?\n\n Melony:\nOh, yes! The local numbers station, WZZZ. Yes, that was one of my\nearly programs. And those numbers and chimes aren\xe2\x80\x99t random, they\xe2\x80\x99re\nencoded messages to foreign spies. Also a few pudding recipes and a\nfunny cryptology poem or two.\n\n Cecil:\nSo you designed Fey, the voice of WZZZ!\n\n Melony:\nOh, the WZZZ program has no name, and absolutely no sentience. Not\nevery program is sentient. That WZZZ program only recites numbers and\ntones. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it does, and all it ever will do. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know\nit exists.\n\n Cecil:\nAbout that\xe2\x80\xa6see, there was a\nthing that happened a couple years ago\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Melony:\nUgh, listen to me babbling on. You had me on to talk about the trial.\n\n Cecil:\nYes. Well, I understand there has been some controversy around the\nethics of making a jury of peers from artificial intelligence, rather\nthan actual five-headed dragons.\n\n Melony:\nOh, there are a lot more problems than just ethics. What are\nethics, even? How can you quantify what is right? I mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s\nassign a number on how ethical a computerized jury is.\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna say it\xe2\x80\x99s a low number, like 1.5 or 2.\n\n Melony:\nBut let\xe2\x80\x99s make it on a scale of 0 to 3. So that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good!\nEverything\xe2\x80\x99s going fine! Ethically speaking, anyway. But the\nprogramming has been tough. Have you ever even tried\nto program a computer?\n\n Cecil:\nI barely know how to turn one on. Say, as long as I have a real\ncomputer expert on, do you have some basic computer tips for me and\nour listeners?\n\n Melony:\nOh! A public service like that would be really\nethical, like a 2.5 or even a 3 on the ethicability scale. What a\ngood idea! Here are some basic tips for the computer novice who\xe2\x80\x99s\nhoping to one day write code that advances us closer to the\nsingularity.\n\n Tip\n1: Computers can make you angry. Anything can make you angry.\nComputers are anything. Tip 2: Is your computer plugged in? That\xe2\x80\x99s\nprobably illegal. You need a license to plug in a computer. Tip 3:\nComputer programs are a lot like humans. They\xe2\x80\x99re full of bugs \xe2\x80\x93 mostly\ntheoretical, and invented by overly caffeinated lonely people in dark\nrooms. Tip 4: Did I say that thing about the stars already?\n\n Cecil:\nYes, I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Melony:\nOh, good! \n\n\n Tip\n5: Create a strong password. The most secure password possible is\n(you\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess this!) where the O is replaced with a zero, and\nthe Ls are replaced with zeros, and all of the other letters are\nreplaced with zeros. A string of 19 zeros is the most secure\npassword.\n\n Cecil:\nI added an exclamation point at the end of my password.\n\n Melony:\nExclamation points are impossible to hack! You are very secure.\n\n Tip\n6: There are two main types of computers. The first are PCs, or\npersona computers. Personal computers know your name, and things\nabout your life, and are casual and friendly. Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re\noverly personal and you end up having to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all too\nmuch. Back off, computer.\xe2\x80\x9d The second type of computer is the house\ncat. These are ambulant robotic quadrupeds used by the Secret Police\nto monitor our domestic behavior and try to understand why people\nlike to stroke robots and talk in high voices to them.\n\n Cecil:\nThis has been very helpful!\n\n Melony:\nAh! Thank you for saying that! I love to be helpful! This trial has\nbeen so challenging, and everyone is upset. These days, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\nhelpful. These days I feel kind of useless and it gets me down.\n\n Cecil:\nAww. I know that feeling. You know, sometimes when I\xe2\x80\x99m sad, I like to\nsing old hymns to myself.\n\n Melony:\nMe too! Which one\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite?\n\n Cecil:\n\xe2\x99\xab I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter \xe2\x99\xab\n\n Cecil and Melony singing together:\n\xe2\x99\xaa Dancin\xe2\x80\x99 through the fire, \xe2\x80\x98cause I am a champion, and you\xe2\x80\x99re\ngonna hear me roar! \xe2\x99\xaa\n\n Cecil: Oh!\n\n Melony:\nWhoo! That\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite passage from the Old Testament! [Sigh]\nI feel better already.\n\n Cecil:\nAww, thanks, Melony.\n\n Melony:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch your name. Goodbye!\n\n Cecil:\nThe mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office reports that perhaps their earlier call for not\nbeing alarmed was a bit premature, and that we could all stand to be\na little more alarmed. Several dead animals have been found all over\ntown \xe2\x80\x93 on sidewalks, in trees and fields, animal corpses\neverywhere.\n\n This\nhas happened before, listeners. Many of you remember the glowing\ncloud (all hail) that\npassed through Night Vale years ago, dropping dead animals on all of\nus. And since that first terrifying and bloody visit, the Glow Cloud\n(all bow before the mighty Cloud)\nhas since settled down as a citizen of this town, even joining the\nschool board, as the Glow Cloud\xe2\x80\x99s child attends Night Vale\nElementary.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nhard to believe that the Glow Cloud (all praise the\nmalevolent Cloud who rules my every puny desire, et cetera, et\ncetera) would return to such\ndreadful acts of violence against animals\xe2\x80\xa6and rooftops. But again,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know why anyone does anything.\n\n John\nPeters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 standing out in his freshly-sown\nfield of imaginary corn near his pastures said he saw a couple of\nmangled squirrels and expired possums.\n\n He\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cI seen them strangers too, the ones what don\xe2\x80\x99t move 'cept\nfor their breathin\xe2\x80\x99? Just breathin\xe2\x80\x99 and breathin\xe2\x80\x99 and sometimes\ngetting a little closer than you think they were a second ago,\ndespite not lookin\xe2\x80\x99 like they were even movin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nalso said he finally received a card from his brother Jim, who left\ntown nearly 40 years ago to fight in the Blood Space War. The message\ninside simply read, \xe2\x80\x9cHappy 12th birthday, little brother! Only\nthree months into my mission, and I am already missing you something\nfierce, Johnny!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n John\ncovered his face and pointed to one of the strangers out on the edge\nof the corn field.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s definitely them strangers what\xe2\x80\x99s killin\xe2\x80\x99 these animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n John\nthen began weeping and clutching the birthday card \xe2\x80\x93 on it, a\nfarmer caricature holding balloons, and a caption reading, \xe2\x80\x9cI love\nyou, 'cows\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99re my brother\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 tightly to his heaving chest.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsor.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is brought to you by Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s. At Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s we make pizza\nwith only the freshest ingredients, using old-world recipes passed\ndown from our family\xe2\x80\x99s many generations of pizza makers. Nearly all\nof these pizza makers are still alive, making pizza and passing down\nrecipes. They live in the back. We\xe2\x80\x99re running out of room for them.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve\nlong given up on thinking they\xe2\x80\x99d eventually die. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they die?\nI mean, we love them, but there are close to 50 people in our family\ndating back to at least the 1800s, their bodies aging and failing,\nbut never\xe2\x80\xa6you know\xe2\x80\xa6dying.\n\n Perhaps\nit\xe2\x80\x99s our secret recipes causing that.\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99d\nthink so, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Because a few members of our family have\nactually passed away\xe2\x80\xa6although, now that we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about it,\nthose were public executions for treason back during the first World\nWar. And another couple were car accidents.\n\n Maybe\nit is the sauce?\n\n Either\nway, visit your local Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s. Order a delicious pizza. How\nhard can it be? Immortality, we mean.\n\n Papa\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n\n And\nnow, a look at traffic.\n\n They\nmet through a mutual acquaintance. They shook hands and met eyes.\nOver food and drinks, and among friends, they laughed and told\nstories.\n\n Occasionally\ntheir eyes lingered. Occasionally one looked away first. They shared\na brief but quiet and private moment on the front porch. It was\ngetting late. People were leaving. It was a new moon that night.\nNeither would remember that part.\n\n One\nof them said goodbye as they headed to their car. The other said\ngoodbye back. They hugged, both thinking in that short embrace about\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s body against their own, about the topography of\nforgiveness, and the geography of tomorrow.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSee\nyou again soon, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nyou too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n They\nparted as the one drove away. Later, the other drove away. It was a\nfun party with good friends, good food and drinks. They would\nremember the laughing and the stories. They would not remember the\nmoon or the name of the other. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up again.\n\n They\nlater met other people, and still other people. Later, they would\ndrive home, and drive home. They never met again. They both lived\nmeaningful lives: laughing drinking, eating, and driving home.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n While\nofficers from the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police are now responding to a\nseries of power outages and broken water mains, witnesses have\nreported a strange sight at the city\xe2\x80\x99s Dog Park. Hooded figures,\nwhich are sometimes glimpsed inside the Dog Park, were all lined up\noutside the Dog Park,\nas if standing guard. A long row of dark cloaks and hoods, humming\nand chanting.\n\n Witnesses\nkept a great distance from this scene, simply noting the hooded\nfigures were all of equal height and imposing stature, spaced evenly\naround the forbidden municipal park.\n\n The\nsidewalks in front of them were empty, except for one young couple \xe2\x80\x93\n and their dog \xe2\x80\x93 who walked slowly past the sentries, unperturbed\nby the presence of these eldritch figures, emanating a crescendo of\nwhite noise. Witnesses watched the couple stroll past the park, turn\na corner, and disappear from sight.\n\n The\nwitnesses reported that just around that corner, where the couple had\nwalked, was a different person \xe2\x80\x93 a stranger, staring right back at\nthe witnesses. They did not recognize the person, for the person had\nno noticeable features.\n\n The\nstranger did not appear to move, except for its steady breathing.\n\n No\nsingle witness saw the stranger move, but suddenly it was closer to\nthe crowd of onlookers, merely feet away from them.\n\n One\nof the witnesses said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe should run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Another\nagreed, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, let\xe2\x80\x99s run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n They\ndid not go anywhere.\n\n And\nnow, let\xe2\x80\x99s check in on the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cWell\nDressed\xe2\x80\x9d by Hop\nAlong]\n\n If\nyou can hear me, Night Vale, it is because you are one of those still\nwith electricity, or whose home is not on fire.\n\n Oh,\nbreaking news, there are a bunch of fires across town. They are\nspreading from home to home. Fire chief Ramona Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n said that\nshe believes the fires were started by the neglect of common but\ndangerous things like kitchen ranges, candles, cigarettes, and blood\nstones.\n\n Encarnaci\xc3\xb3n\nsaid these strangers are appearing at doorways, and in windows, and\ninside showers, and from behind refrigerators, just staring and\nbreathing and otherwise not moving. Upon seeing these strangers, the\nresidents of those homes became frozen in fear, and thus incapable of\ntending to their flammable items.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNever\nleave a blood stone unattended, Night Vale!\xe2\x80\x9d\nEncarnaci\xc3\xb3n cautioned.\n\n Mayor\nDana Cardinal finally relented to the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s request to try to\nround up the strangers. Sheriff Sam responded with a jumping heel\nclick, and a \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry, mayor!\xe2\x80\x9d as they ran out to\nstart making arrests.\n\n Sam\nhas long held that the strangers are just troublemakers who\xe2\x80\x99ve moved\nhere from the collapsed town of Desert Bluffs, our former neighbors.\nBut upon arriving at several of the burning homes, Sam began to have\na change of mind\xe2\x80\xa6or belief.\n\n These\nstrangers were not\nfrom Desert Bluffs at all. These strangers, Sam now believes, are\nsomething else.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nare not from here,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot here\nmeaning Night Vale, but\xe2\x80\xa6HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSam then indicated the broadness of the term 'here\xe2\x80\x99 by swinging their\narm slowly to indicate the entirety of the tangible world we all\npretend to know and understand.\n\n The\nSecret Police, instead of arresting or detaining or\xe2\x80\xa6even getting\nnear the strangers, began to move the petrified residents of each of\nthese homes safely away to an undisclosed location. Which, I assume,\nmeans the same thing as a safe location, since the Secret Police are\nlaw enforcement professionals\xe2\x80\xa6?\n\n The\nstrangers never moved, other than their steady breaths, even when\nthey sometimes appeared dramatically closer than they were before.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nstrangers seemed to have no goal other than to threaten our\nwell-being, Night Vale,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam explained wordlessly, using only a\nlong ribbon and floor dance routine to express the dire situation we\nare all facing. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Secret Police and I will to serve and protect\nyou. Secretly, of course. This is off the record. In the meantime,\nstay in your homes, and lock your doors. If you see a stranger, keep\nmoving, and call us. We\xe2\x80\x99re an unlisted number, actually, so\xe2\x80\xa6maybe\nemail,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam said with a flick of their ribbon and a double\nsomersault.\n\n Night\nVale, I\xe2\x80\xa6I think back to the words of Little League coach and ghost\nLucia Tereschenko. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re no longer coming. They\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nAnd we cannot stop something that wants nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nI think of the image of that young couple and their dog, blithely\npassing the row of fearful hooded figures. No doubt it was Maureen,\nand that boy, and that beagle. Maureen is such a good kid! And that\nbeagle? So, so cute! So CUTE! Ugh.\nBut I fear for whatever it is she and that boy and that dog are\ninvolved in.\n\n Heed\nour sheriff tonight, Night Vale. Stay safe in your home. Get away\nfast of you see one of them.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for words, ordered intentionally and confidently, saying\nsomething, understanding nothing.\n\n And,\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale.\n\n Ooh!\nMaybe lock those windows, too.\n\n Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Call me old\nfashioned, but I believe there should be only one continent."
