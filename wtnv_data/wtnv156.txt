133 - Are You Sure?
b"[NOTE: This episode has three alternative versions of the ending, each with its alternate weather and proverb. The podcast services will randomly play one version, and you can access other versions by refreshing the page.]\n\n Is this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this? Are you sure? Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting again. As many of you certainly noticed, we are having a problem of timeline divergence here in Night Vale. Events are happening over and over, and each instance is different than the last. Earl Harlan, sous-chef at Tourniquet, was preparing a fresh salad with wood glue vinaigrette, and decided to do a spinach base, but then he was preparing a fresh salad with wood glue vinaigrette and decided on a romaine base. The same event twice with drastically different outcomes. Also there was that tragic story from the Night Vale Daily Journal about that plane that crashed at Night Vale International Airport but \xe2\x80\x93 when we looked at the paper again, it-it was a really boring story about a plane that landed safely with no unusual incidents. It was a stunning tragedy, and a totally mundane event, simultaneously, and it is unclear which of those really happened. \n\n My husband, Carlos, whose long perfect hair was looking unusually perfect, does not know what is causing these fracturing timelines. He\xe2\x80\x99s been busy in his lab saying that he is working on an incredibly important project related to this, and he needs to see it through. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure in a black satin mask stood on top of the former Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s factory watching this chaos unfold. Who is this figure? And what do they want? More soon. Or, maybe just this again, but with a slightly different wording. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \n\n And now, traffic. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood. And so I decided to take both. Being one traveler, I split myself good by a process I barely understood. A third me slithered \xe2\x80\x98neath the undergrowth. Through the trees I could see myself walk, merely me but I started to hate him. For if I\xe2\x80\x99m real, then he is the mock. We turned as one, as one began to talk, each quoting the other verbatim. I shall be asking and asking why, two iterations of myself hence. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and I took them both, and many others beside. It turned out, there never was a difference. This has been traffic. \n\n This splitting of timelines in town has only gotten worse. And it seems that it is connected to the mysterious figure in a black satin mask. Wherever they go, things happen, and also happen differently. And also happen even differently than that. When the masked figure visited the library and asked for a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Artist\xe2\x80\x99s Husband\xe2\x80\x9d, that hit novel about an artist and a time traveler who get married. The librarians began keening and banging on their cages. But also, they got very quiet. Several librarians escaped, but also they didn\xe2\x80\x99t escape. And several bystanders were mauled by those loose librarians, but also they were fine and went back to their homes saying things like \xe2\x80\x9cWow, uneventful day today.\xe2\x80\x9d And, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing exciting has ever happened to me and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been injured.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n When the masked figure stopped at the Ralphs, weekday shift manager Charlie Bear accidentally spilled a box of cereal in aisle 3. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s cereal of course, since no other cereal is allowed in town anymore. But at the same time, Charlie spilled Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s cereal all over aisle 5. Which is the cleaning supplies aisle. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how that even happened, but it did. And at that exact moment, the Ralphs wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Ralphs, but instead a Vons. \n\n Now this is truly getting baffling. How do I report on a story that is many different stories at once, all contradicting each other? And just who is this mysterious figure in the black satin mask? Further updates when more is known, and possibly simultaneously not known.\n\n And now the Community Calendar. Monday is pizza night at the Last Bank of Night Vale. Come by for this fun community event that features free pizza, a DJ, and paperwork that looks like a softball signup sheet, but actually commits you to a predatory loan. Meanwhile, Monday is karaoke night at the Last Bank of Night Vale. Come and join our employees in song. Unfortunately we planned this slightly last minute, and so the only CD we could find was a collection of nature sounds. So do your best to sing along to such hot numbers as \xe2\x80\x9cRustling Leaves #5\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cMiscellaneous Beach Noise\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Hours of Burbling Brook\xe2\x80\x9d. Then Monday is art gallery night at the Last Bank of Night Vale. Do you make art? [chuckling] Why? Just what are you trying to prove? Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re better than us? Yeah, come-come try to justify yourself this Monday night at the Last Bank of Night Vale. \n\n And finally, Monday is the annual kids fundraising dinner at the Last Bank of Night Vale. Catered by Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s own Earl Harlan. Join this fun and delicious celebration as we raise money to kids. Which we will then give to the kids, no strings attached. I wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend it on? \n\n Huh. Something was off about this Community Calendar, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t put my finger on what. I mean looking back, it seems normal. Kind of a light week, only one event. Monday night at the Last Bank of Night Vale is a garage sale. They have all sorts of weird stuff, people are put in safe deposit boxes, and it feels like a waste leaving them sitting there. Come and make an offer. So that\xe2\x80\x99s normal. Not sure what it was. \n\n Carlos has reached out to me with a concern. He said he\xe2\x80\x99s busy at work on this problem, but given that events have been turning out with wildly different outcomes, how will we know which outcome is true? This day will end however it ends, he said. But how will we know the ending we experience is real? What if resolving this crisis is merely another splitting possibility, and at the same time there\xe2\x80\x99s us still dealing with the crisis? And that is a very real concern. I guess I can only say that it\xe2\x80\x99s uuuuh\xe2\x80\xa6 a gut thing? I mean I feel like when this is resolved, we\xe2\x80\x99ll know the real series of events, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just know them, you know? Because they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the ones that actually happened. Carlos tells me that gut feelings aren\xe2\x80\x99t scientific, but I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell what are guts made out of? Science, right?\xe2\x80\x9d And he had to concede that point. Then I told him his short cropped hair looked \xe2\x80\x93 more perfect than usual, and he blushed. \n\n Still, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, [scoffs], I must keep Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 concern in mind as this day wraps up. I-I\xe2\x80\x99ll need to pay attention and make sure that what is happening is the only version of that event, and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t stray versions sprawling out their own timelines somewhere else. \n\n And now a word from our sponsor. Today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is\xe2\x80\xa6 huh, okaay. Hmm, they just sent a video tape with the labels torn off of it. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch it and describe what I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing. [clears throat] [talking fast] It\xe2\x80\x99s a black and white shot of a kitchen, a man is making a sandwich, it\xe2\x80\x99s a falafel sandwich with cucumbers and tomatoes and he eats the sandwich, smiles at the camera and leaves the room. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a big red text thing, uh \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be another way\xe2\x80\x9d. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re back at the kitchen and the man is making a sandwich. He seems confused, as though he remembers having just done this. In his confusion, as he is cutting the tomatoes, the knife slips and oh my god- oh my god! Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s screaming but now that same text \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be another way\xe2\x80\x9d and the, the man is back making the sandwich and he\xe2\x80\x99s still screaming, uh but he realizes his hand is intact, and he goes to the phone uh to make a call and he slips and bangs his head on the counter and he falls out of frame and the text says again \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be another way\xe2\x80\x9d. And the man is back and and, and he\xe2\x80\x99s pale and shaking and he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling his head, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not broken open and he runs to the door and out into the yard and the camera follows him, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear who is filming, and there is an earthquake and and a crevice opens up in his lawn and he disappears into it and again, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be another way\xe2\x80\x9d and he is back in the kitchen and he\xe2\x80\x99s weeping. How long is this? OK, it, OK it looks like this tape is at least three hours long, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch the rest of it later uhhhh, and kind of summarize. Maybe then we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out who is even sponsoring this thing. \n\n The diverging timelines disaster is only worsening. And Night Vale of course has no mayor to deal with the issue. Except that sometimes we do have a mayor and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s Dana Cardinal, and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s Pamela Winchell, and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a tall obsidian statue with wings and a thousand faces, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear which of these timelines are real. \n\n The Sheriff tried to restore order saying: \xe2\x80\x9cListen, no matter what timeline you find yourself in, just maintain a calm disposition, lie face down wherever you are, and wait for a Secret Police officer to collect you.\xe2\x80\x9d But the problem is that anyone is following these directions finds that they have simultaneously not followed those directions. And so the problem doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem possible to resolve.\n\n Meanwhile, the worst of the effects are following the figure in the black satin mask, although nothing more has been learned as to who they are, or what their role in all this might be and so\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Ah, listeners\xe2\x80\xa6 [quietly] the masked figure, they walked into the station, and they\xe2\x80\x99re standing on the other side of the control room glass. They are reaching up now and pulling off the mask. \n\n Oh my god it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6 Hold on, I need to deal with this. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the weather.\n\n -THE ALTERNATE VERSIONS START HERE-\n\n EARL HARLAN ENDING  [transcribed by Nikittypaprika, many thanks!]\n\n [Weather: \xe2\x80\x9cShadows\xe2\x80\x9d by Caged Animals, cageanimals.bandcamp.com]\n\n Listeners, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. The masked figure all this time was my old friend, Earl Harlan. Earl stood there, a black satin mask in hand, with an even more solemn than usual expression. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for this to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, his eyes filling up with an inky blackness. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing to remember. Okay, Cecil?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOkay,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what exactly is happening?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n He pressed his phone to the glass and showed me a text conversation he\xe2\x80\x99d been having with his son, Roger. It was a string of emojis, mainly the waving arms octopus, plus the minotaur with sunglasses, plus the movie theatre on fire with a marquee that has a picture of another movie theatre on fire. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what this means?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cRoger wants to go out with his friends tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d Earl explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to walk blindfolded into the desert with their backpacks filled with rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds kind of dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, not sure what this had to do with the timeline problem. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, right?\xe2\x80\x9d said Earl. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if I say no, Roger will be mad at me, and his friends will think he\xe2\x80\x99s uncool, and I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want Roger to be mad at me, and friendships are so important at that age. They\xe2\x80\x99re just so intense. I mean I was nineteen for a really long time, I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRight, right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, the timelines.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAlso,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cmy assistant keeps asking if we\xe2\x80\x99re doing croquettes or funnel cakes for the kids fundraising dinner, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know! I mean, whatever we choose could change the course of the night and our lives forever. I finally had to block her number. And then I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to pick the colors for the new boy scout uniforms. Dry blood red and khaki brown, or fresh blood red and khaki green? I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to the point of wearing a black satin mask so no one can recognize me and ask me to make any more big decisions today. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been good at things like this.\xe2\x80\x9d Earl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were shiny and dark as oil slicks. \xe2\x80\x9cLike earlier, at Vons?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cm-my shopping list had one thing on it. I was there for six hours. I walked out of Ralphs with nothing. You\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised, Cecil, how often I leave that store with nothing at all, feeling dazed and starved and exhausted, my empty reusable canvas bag flapping against my side in the hot wind.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n And I tried to reassure him that we all do that, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hear me. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSome days, all I do is think about the things I could have done,\xe2\x80\x9d Earl said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike I keep having these visions of this one moment that I can\xe2\x80\x99t even really remember. I-I was in a car, or-or it, it was on a porch, when the light burned out, or it was in a brightly lit hallway with a party going on in the next room, there was something, I-I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, some thing I was afraid to do, and told myself I could do it later when it felt less scary but some opportunities only happen once before they become unattainable forever. Do you know what I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n After a moment, I said \xe2\x80\x9cYeah?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Earl\xe2\x80\x99s head tilted back. Darkness beamed from his eyes until the daylight outside was stained to night. \xe2\x80\x9cCar. Porch. Hallway. Khaki. Blood. Croquettes. Octopus. Minotaur. Movie theatre,\xe2\x80\x9d he chanted, until the words became just rhythmic, guttural sounds. Finally, Earl\xe2\x80\x99s phone vibrated. His head un-tilted and his eyes stopped beaming as he fished around in his pocket. It was a text from an old friend. A very old, very good friend. They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken in some time, not really spoken. Not like they used to. It said: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while, but I just wanted you to know. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of cool that you can\xe2\x80\x99t make choices. Like, maybe that makes you more of a part of the universe and less of an impactor upon it. Maybe we could all be a little bit more like that. Y'know.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Earl felt suddenly relieved, as if many years of heaviness had lifted. The blackness in his eyes receded, and the sky grew light again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I have to make choices at all? Why do any of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Now the friend had may not have meant that exactly, but at this point, there was nothing he could do to take it back. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more choices!\xe2\x80\x9d Earl said, shutting his eyes tightly. And then he walked down the hallway, out the door into the too-bright sunlight of dawn, and then he walked down the hallway, out the door, and then he walked down the hallway, out the door. Since this moment, citizens agree that one reality remains in Night Vale, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s the correct one. \n\n Hot take. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one hundred percent sure. I mean, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d have a gut feeling, but I just feel I dunno\xe2\x80\xa6 [huffs] unsettled? I feel like I have to look at everything that happened today, and just keep looking at it until it makes sense, y'know? Hm, speaking of gut feelings, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting updates that the Ralphs no longer stocks Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s cereal, and in fact stocks one product in every aisle: Castellano brand colossal squid stuffed with their own viscera, which I understand is an important Spanish tapas. Great appetizers for your dinner parties, or just for complete meals, snacks and all sustenance from now on. Ralphs: for all your shopping needs involving Castellano brand colossal squid stuffed with their own viscera. I need to make sure this was how it actually turned out. I need to begin again. Is this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this? Are you sure? Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: This one real trick doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have any real purpose. But maybe give it a try anyway.\n\n TELLY ENDING [featuring Dylan Marron as Carlos]\n\n [Weather: \xe2\x80\x9cWild Flowers\xe2\x80\x9d by Caged Animals, cagedanimals.bandcamp.com]\n\n Listeners, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. The masked figure, all this time, was Telly the Barber.\n\n Yes! Telly! Who soon after my Carlos came to town with his beautiful and perfect hair, gave Carlos just a hideous haircut! It was an affront to all that is good in this world. And in his rightful shame, Telly fled into the desert, howling his regret to the night sky and giving wild haircuts to the cacti. No one in town has spoken his name in years. And now here he is, apparently destroying our timelines. Is there no end to the crimes that Telly can commit? \n\n Telly was weeping, and he shouted through the glass window of my booth: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make it right!\xe2\x80\x9d and he was fogging up the window and that was annoying and I could hardly hear him, so I told him to come inside. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make it right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at a more reasonable volume. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to change the past so that I never gave that haircut. But it has all been going wrong! Instead of changing the moment of my vile haircut, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been splitting every possible point of divergence in all of the timelines of Night Vale. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t what I wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n [angrily] Telly, what a mess! And that was when Carlos arrived, and I could tell he had come in a hurry because he was wearing his casual house labcoat, which he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be seen in. He mostly wears it to bed, or you know when he\xe2\x80\x99s doing the dishes, but that was the least of it. His hair was going through a truly- bizarre transformation. As I watched, it kept radically changing lengths and and styles from a Mohawk to a shaved head to a-a gorgeous hair stretching halfway to the floor! His hair could not stay the same for longer than a few seconds. And then Carlos said\xe2\x80\xa6 well, hear for yourself. \n\n Carlos: Oh, Telly! I had thought it was me. I had thought it was my fault. You know, in the lab, I had managed to track the source of the timeline divergence to soon after I came to town. And like that made me afraid somehow that my presence was causing this. I was too ashamed to say so even to my husband, because what would it mean if this was rejecting me somehow? But now I understand. I got that haircut from you right around when I arrived, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the source of this is. And, and Telly \xe2\x80\x93 can I just let you know, I really liked that haircut.\n\n Cecil:\xc2\xa0But Telly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. He shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cThat haircut ruined my life! I regret it every day, I must fix it!\xe2\x80\x9d And he started fiddling with the device he had invented to change the past, and that is when things truly took a turn. \n\n Night Vale vanished. And the three of us \xe2\x80\x93 were standing on an empty desert plane. And then Night Vale was back, but it was different. A neon-studded city at night, all futuristic flying cars and citizens with downturned eyes hurrying back to their dingy apartments. And then we were in space, somewhere in the far flung battlefields of the blood space wars, and around us were explosions and thousands dying and then, we were back in the radio booth again and Telly was weeping and weeping. And Carlos put his hand on Telly. \xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlos said, \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d and Telly stopped. Then Carlos said\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Carlos: Listen, Telly, the haircut was great. I loved it! So maybe Cecil didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Maybe no one else in the entire universe liked it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Because I loved it. And I got it for me. You have nothing to be ashamed of, you never did! Come back to us. Come back to us and restart your life. You were one of us all this time!\n\n Cecil:\xc2\xa0So \xe2\x80\x93 Telly did. He moved back in from the desert and has reopened his barbershop. He has resumed friendships with people he had only thought hated him, but instead, had been giving him his space. There had been a misapprehension on both sides and that had led to years of disconnect. Years that were finally healing. \n\n I still think that haircut was a crime, buut, my husband tells me my opinion on that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter soo\xe2\x80\xa6 [clears throat crankily]. \n\n The timelines in Night Vale have settled down. Everything is only happening once and only in one way. It seems the day has been saved by Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 superhuman forgiveness and perfect hair. \n\n Or was it? Because as Carlos said earlier, how can we know that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just one timeline? And somewhere else there\xe2\x80\x99s a Night Vale where this all happened differently, and what if that\xe2\x80\x99s the real Night Vale? \n\n Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to find out, listeners. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna start this broadcast again and see if it turns out the same way. \n\n Is this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this? Are you sure? Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: How do I love thee? Let me tally up all the points I\xe2\x80\x99ve assigned to your personal value with respect to my needs. \n\n LEANN HART ENDING\n\n [Weather: \xe2\x80\x9cEscape Artist\xe2\x80\x9d by Caged Animals, cagedanimals.bandcamp.com]\n\n Listeners, I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. The masked figure all this time was Daily Journal editor Leann Hart! Leann shattered the control booth glass, leapt forward and thrust a well polished hatchet to my face, pressing the sharpened blade against my cheek. Hatchets are tools common among print news professionals for threatening internet-based publications, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I was her target. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLeann, I\xe2\x80\x99m a radio host, not a news blogger, I\xe2\x80\x99m not your enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d Leann said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m-I\xe2\x80\x99m not threatening you. I\xe2\x80\x99m just showing you the new hatchet I bought. It\xe2\x80\x99s Palladium, cost me a fortune, feel that, so nice. The metal stays cool and soft but it cuts through bone like a copyeditor through adverts.\xe2\x80\x9d And then we both laughed, [laughs] \xe2\x80\x9cAhha,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an extremely funny joke that only us true journalists would understand.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe word \xe2\x80\x98extremely\xe2\x80\x99 was unnecessary there, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d Leann growled pressing the blade tighter to my face. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a nice hatchet, Leann,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut-but how did you afford it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no money in media these days unless you have a true crime podcast?\xe2\x80\x9d Leann smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWait. Did you start a true crime podcast?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause that would be a great idea to murder a bunch of people, and then do a podcast about it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI have something even better, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have \xe2\x80\x93 time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Leann said she time traveled over and over throughout each day, and then selling newspapers across hundreds of concurrent timelines. She increased the number of days she could sell papers, but not the amount of time or labor involved. She made millions. She tried to stay out of the stories, not wanting to change the arc of our future, but no matter how objective she remained, the repeated day was always different. So she gave up trying to stay disinterested and began to actually influence each event. Now there was a car chase on Route 800 last Tuesday, and in one version, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police stopped the subject without violence and then took him to jail with lots of violence. In another version, the suspect got away by fleeing on foot out into the Scrublands. And in another version, Leann Hart thwarted the suspect from ever stealing the car in the first place, thus saving police from endangering themselves and others and protecting the car\xe2\x80\x99s owner from an awful day, followed by months or arguing with an insurance company. But Leann found that this third version didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell papers, because there was no story. What proved most lucrative was an ongoing fear amongst the readers needing to know how this horrible crime would be resolved. Weeks of a fugitive on the loose led to weeks of great sales. As the city filled with angst, fought for more police protection, and formed theories about who the criminal mastermind was.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh yeah, I remember this story now,\xe2\x80\x9d I told Leann. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never caught the guy, did we?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh we did,\xe2\x80\x9d Leann said. \xe2\x80\x9cI finagled the timeline where he was captured, but only because the story stopped selling papers. I needed something more exciting so then, I convinced this psychopath who had been murdering stray animals to instead poison the town water supply, and we all died. That was a bad one. No one bought a single paper.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLeann, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do this. You can\xe2\x80\x99t keep traveling through time and manipulating our fates to sell papers,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unethical, immoral even, to make money by ruining lives.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she said I must hate capitalism an called me a socialist and \xe2\x80\x93 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a comeback. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m giving up the time travel thing anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso I promise to stop creating dangerous news stories to sell papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\n\n I told her it must have been a tough but fulfilling journey through her own soul to elevate compassion for others above personal gain. I told Leann I was proud of her decision. And she said negative news stories didn\xe2\x80\x99t really sell anyway. (\xe2\x80\x93) from time traveling she had cultivated a large sample size of sales data, showing sustained emotional arguments based around raw fear were the best approach. And the Daily Journal from this point forward would be exclusively op-ed.\n\n And with a gleam in her eye, Leann showed me tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s front page headline: \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Schools Should Not Give Pornography to Our Kids.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re handing out pornography in school?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe point is that they should not be doing that, whether they are or not. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sell a bunch of papers, this will be a story for weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\n\n And I agreed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to sell papers with only half informed opinions about non-existing issues, I mean it saves on time spent researching and reporting and, more importantly no water will be poisoned, no cars will be stolen. Irrational headlines will initiate helpful discussions and friendly debate, with absolutely no harm done.\xc2\xa0\n\n Leann left the office and told me I could report her story, but only on embargo until the Daily Journal scooped it. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s taken me a week to tell you this. Or at least\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been a week? You know, I wanna make sure. This was how it actually turned out. I need to begin again.\n\n Is this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this? Are you sure? Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: True change starts with the person in the mirror. He\xe2\x80\x99s standing far behind you, barely visible. He\xe2\x80\x99s really going to change things."
