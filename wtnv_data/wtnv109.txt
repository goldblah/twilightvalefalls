Episode 90 - Who’s a Good Boy? Part 2
b'You wanna go outside? Outside? You\nwanna go outside? You do? You do?\n\n I bet you want to go outside.\nI bet you do!\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths]\n\n The\nbeagle puppy stood fully upright on his hind legs, breathing heavily.\nI inched back from the dog.\n\n Here\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhere I want to tell you I drew a glowing sword, and he drew a sword\nmade of fire. I want to tell you our mighty blades clashed above our\nheads, as our elbows and faces met. I think it\xe2\x80\x99d be a really cool\nthing to say that I then pushed him back with a kick to the chest and\nswung my blade down upon him as he tried to deflect it with his own,\nmy sword shattering his, causing him to burst open with white light\nand doves, and order returned for good to Night Vale.\n\n But\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you is\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t own a sword, doves aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nreal, and the dog had destroyed everything we are without a single\nconventional weapon. Plus, I tripped while trying to run away.\n\n The\nbeagle was standing over me.\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths]\n\n There\nwas a boom that dimmed my hearing, and the dog was jolted backward\nviolently. Sam, our sheriff, stood behind me, a shotgun in their\nhand.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCome\non!\xe2\x80\x9d Sam said as they grabbed my shoulder and pulled me up.\n\n I\nturned back to see the carnage, but the beagle was standing again,\nexactly where he was the moment before\xe2\x80\xa6perhaps a little closer,\nactually. His adorable puppy mouth distended horribly with each\nlabored breath.\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths]\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nlook at it!\xe2\x80\x9d Sam said as they pushed me into City Hall and through\na door marked FORBIDDEN. Sam slammed the door shut and bolted the\nlock.\n\n We\nwere in the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. The Council was there.\nThey had not fled the\ncity after all. They all spoke in unison, their black robes\nundulating like a storm-tossed ocean. The only details of the\nCouncil\xe2\x80\x99s hood-shrouded faces I could discern were their\nreddish-brown teeth.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nhave re-opened the Dog Park!\xe2\x80\x9d the City Council shouted. It sounded\nlike an accusation. \xe2\x80\x9cSam plans to lure the strangers into the Dog\nPark and lock them away there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x93\nhow do you\xe2\x80\xa6how do you get them to go 7into\nthe Dog Park?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\n The\nCouncil was silent for a long time, finally muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\nleader is a beagle,\nso\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and then trailing off.\n\n Sam\ninterjected. \xe2\x80\x9cWe get every person left in Night Vale in front of\nthat Dog Park. If they want nothing, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go there and\ncreate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\nwas thinking about what \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d meant. About beings that don\xe2\x80\x99t\nexist. And who better to fight off a lord of Hell than\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSounds\ngood,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a way out of here that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go\nthrough that beagle? I need to visit a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a look now at traffic.\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s\na metal grate, about 11 feet off the ground. It\xe2\x80\x99s large enough for\nmost human bodies to fit through. There are eight 10-millimeter\nhexagonal bolts holding it in place.\n\n Sitting\natop a person\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting atop another person\xe2\x80\x99s\nshoulders and then using a simple torque wrench, it is not difficult\nto remove these bolts and pull oneself through, into the duct work.\nThe duct eventually ends at a similar large grate.\n\n Then\nthere is a 12-foot drop to the ground behind City Hall next to a\ndumpster. A car, driven by Mayor Dana Cardinal, is there. Then, that\ncar drives to Old Woman Josie\xe2\x80\x99s house, out by the Used Car Lot.\n\n This\nhas been Traffic.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cCan\nI speak to Erika?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Old Woman Josie.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhich\nErika?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAll\nof them! I need to speak with the angels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Old\nWoman Josie winced. A couple miles off I heard the Angel Acknowledge\nSiren go off down by the fire house, but I was certain law\nenforcement was dealing with bigger problems than a radio host who\nhappened to acknowledge an angel or two.\n\n There\nare way more than two,\nthough.\n\n A\nbright black light filled Old Woman Josie\xe2\x80\x99s living room, illuminating\nat least a dozen tall winged beings. Dana and I shaded our eyes. My\nbody tingled. I swore I could hear a cello, and smell confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s\nsugar.\n\n Dana\nand I explained the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s plan to lure the strangers to the Dog\nPark.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHow\ndo you lure something that wants nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d one of the Erikas asked.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cTechnically\nwanting nothing is actually wanting something,\xe2\x80\x9d\none of the Erikas explained.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot having this argument with you again, Erika!\xe2\x80\x9d another Erika\nshouted.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\njust need to do something,\xe2\x80\x9d\nI said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf what they want is nothing,\nthen we must make sure that we are always doing something!\nCan you help us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nblack light grew painfully bright. I took that as a \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a look now at today\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes.\n\n The\nstars are silent. They have been absent from the sky for weeks now.\nThey refuse to tell us anything. Perhaps the silence is for our own\nprotection.\n\n This\nhas been horoscopes.\n\n On\nthe drive back to town with Dana:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nknow he tried to kill you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI know he is on\ndeath row now for his crimes, but\xe2\x80\xa6what if?\nWhat if we made a deal?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Dana\ninterrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not offering Hiram a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n We\ndrove past the dark and empty radio station. I thought about\nKhoshekh, our station cat, who hovers four feet off the ground in\nwhat used to be the men\xe2\x80\x99s restroom. Oh, all of our restrooms are\nunisex now, which is great,\nbecause everyone can visit Khoshekh! He\xe2\x80\x99s been much happier with the\nextra attention, buzzing and licking visitors with his chest\ntongues\xe2\x80\xa6but when I had last checked in on him, before we lost all\npower to the radio station, he was\xe2\x80\xa6gone. His kittens were also\ngone. No sign of a fight, just gone.\n\n I\nmissed him. I miss the radio station. All over town no electricity,\nno gas, barely any drinkable water. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\xa6I could smell distant\nsmoke. The sky was completely gray, even though there was not a\nsingle cloud.\n\n Dana\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Hiram, Cecil. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out if he knows\nanything about the strangers, and if he could be of some help. But\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not\ncutting a deal with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n We\npulled up to a mob of about 50 people. In the front was the sheriff,\nhand in hand with a woman in long yellow robes and a wide rectangular\nhat. I recognized the medallion on the front of her chest. She was\none of the leaders from the Joyous Congregation of the Smiling God \xe2\x80\x93\nthe church that most of Desert Bluffs and a few Night Vale residents\nbelong to.\n\n In\nthe crowd I saw John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 and also\nJohn Peter \xe2\x80\x93 remember, the pharmacist? I saw Tamika Flynn and her\nteenage militia. In Tamika\xe2\x80\x99s left hand was Sarah Sultan, who is a\nfist-sized river rock and current president of the Night Vale\nCommunity College. Around them were many faces I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow. Former Desert Bluffs residents, I could see it in their eyes.\n\n Dana\nand I got out of the car and joined them. A prayer march against a\ncommon enemy.\n\n How\nstrange humankind is that two cities, Night Vale and Desert Bluffs,\ncould hate each other so\nmuch\xe2\x80\xa6and\nthen hold hands so tightly in mutual hatred of something else.\n\n We\nmarched toward the center of town, chanting prayers. I have never\nbeen a believer in the Smiling God, so some of the chants were new to\nme, but a lot of them were similar to recitations, verses, and\nprayers common across most religions. Basic stuff like \xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\nGod, destroy our enemies, amen,\xe2\x80\x9d some really long gurgling sounds,\nand one chant that sounded identical to an old prayer I was taught in\nTorah school, where everyone just shouts, \xe2\x80\x9cDe-fense! De-fense!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhile clapping in rhythm.\n\n Our\ncrowd grew. We saw strangers on the street, not moving, just\nbreathing and watching. We were nearing a thousand, our mob, feeling\ninvincible!\nUnited to save our town, a town we all loved and believed in, no\nmatter how long each of us had lived there.\n\n Carlos\njoined, along with my sister Abby, her husband Steve, and my young\nniece Janice. I was worried for their safety out here, surrounded by\nthe strangers, but I was also worried for their safety at home,\nhiding\nfrom the strangers. I was worried for their safety always and\neverywhere.\n\n Our\nhuge crowd stopped near the Dog Park. There were Hooded Figures in\nthe Dog Park. The gates were open. They are\xe2\x80\xa6rarely open.\n\n We\nlooked at the strangers. Their numbers had grown as well, an equal\nmotionless mob to our heaving praying one. Being at the front of the\ncrowd, I could feel the steady breath of the stranger directly in\nfront of me. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t dead. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t undead.\nThey were\xe2\x80\xa6nothing.\n\n I\nwas afraid of dying, of becoming one of them, of existing only in the\ndark wet cavern. Francis\xe2\x80\x99 voice in my head: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still in the mud!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m still in the mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nalso her voice from right in front of me suddenly, at the front of\nthe crowd of strangers, eyes wild as though struggling against the\ncomplete stillness of the rest of her body, screaming,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6still\xe2\x80\xa6in the mud! I\xe2\x80\x99m still\xe2\x80\xa6in\xe2\x80\xa6the mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\ncrowd of strangers parted, although none of us saw them move,\nrevealing the beagle puppy on his hind legs, his front paws dangling\ncrookedly against his chest.\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths]\n\n The\nbreathing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming from the dog, but from behind\nme! I turned to see Sheriff Sam, their jaw hanging limp and open, the\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s breath came from their mouth!\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths]\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s\na good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nvoice coming from Sam \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s\na good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n [Heavy\ngrowling breaths, ending in a growling chuckle]\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAm\nI\nthe good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said a different voice from right next to me, my\nbrother-in-law Steve. His eyes locked to mine, confused. \xe2\x80\x9cAm\xe2\x80\xa6am I\nthe good boy?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n I\ncried out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d and held him tight. Janice, Abby, and Carlos all\nput their arms around him too, trying to hold him in place, keep him\nfrom being taken to the cavern, helping him to resist the pull of a\ndark and muddy Hell dragging at him from within.\n\n We\nheard a sound above us, like wings. Many\nwings. We looked up and saw all\nof the Erikas circling above.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThere\nare angels!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Janice in awe. No one corrected her.\n\n There\nwas also the sound of a different kind of wing. Not angelic.\nReptilian. We saw the five heads of Hiram McDaniels, four of them\nwith prison tracking collars. Fire spewed from Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and for\na moment the gray cloudless sky shone blue.\n\n And\nI finally noticed, in the heart of all this fear and tempest, how\ncalm\nthe weather was. No, not calm. The weather was\xe2\x80\xa6it was\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe\nQueer Gospel\xe2\x80\x9d by Erin\nMcKeown]\n\n Night\nVale, we have power once again! We have electricity, and water, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nback on the air(!), and many of you are back in your homes. The\nstrangers and the dogs are gone! Defeated\xe2\x80\xa6question mark.\n\n Francis,\nSam, Steve, those who were taken, or who were about to be taken, all\nhumans once again.\n\n But\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s where we run into the problem of my narrative, because\xe2\x80\xa6I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what caused it to happen! Our crowd had chanted and\nprayed, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a religious person, mostly, but I do\nthink we had an impact, driving away that thing\nsummoned from the dark wet caverns of Hell.\n\n And\neven if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthe blood stones, or the Joyous Congregation\xe2\x80\x99s Smiling God, or any\nother kind of God, the\nmere spiritual coming together of so many people may have been enough\nto rid the town of this hound and his army.\n\n But\nthen, Intern Kareem reported that Khoshekh is back in the station\nrestroom. Khoshekh was badly scratched up, as though he had been in a\ngreat battle, and Kareem noticed that inside Khoshekh\xe2\x80\x99s second row of\nteeth was a small piece of fur-covered flesh. Kareem thought it was a\npiece of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s ear. Is Khoshekh our hero?\n\n Janice\nsays Tamika Flynn drove away the strangers with her militia of\nbook-loving children. Abby and Steve told Janice she\xe2\x80\x99s still too\nyoung to join a militia, and Tamika\xe2\x80\x99s running drills out in the\ndesert and will not comment on what happened.\n\n Old\nWoman Josie claimed the angels used their powers of Heavenly good to\npush back the brazen evil of the beagle. Who else can destroy a\ncreature of Hell, other than angels? Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrue\xe2\x80\xa6if you believe in angels. Which you are not allowed to do.\n\n Melony\nPennington, celebrated computer programmer, managed to get the power\nutilities back on, and claims that with the help of young prodigy\nMeghan Wallaby, she wrote a deadly\ncomputer virus to bring down the strangers. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really an expert\non programming, but I feel like you need a computer to catch a\ncomputer virus.\n\n What?\nOh.\n\n Um,\nKareem is telling me you don\xe2\x80\x99t\nanymore. Computer\nviruses are totally airborne. Huh! Wow! Technology!\n\n Sheriff\nSam and the City Council claimed their plan to lure the strangers to\nthe Dog Park worked perfectly, and the strangers were rounded up and\nlocked away. Sam also added, \xe2\x80\x9cNow that the situation is under\ncontrol, the Dog Park is no longer open.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they folded an\norigami sea urchin, elaborate thin spines and everything. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\nno, it\xe2\x80\x99s off limits once again,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam said.\n\n Michelle\nand Maureen, over at Dark Owl Records, claimed they were playing a\ncopy of Beyonc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s newest album, the followup to Lemonade \xe2\x80\x93 an\nalbum no one else has heard. According to Michelle, the strangers\nwanted to hear that album quite badly, and this human desire filled\nin the hollow that these years in the mud had carved in them, turning\nthem back into non-strangers, into friends. Michelle and Maureen\nclaim to be the real heroes, or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever.\n\n I\nasked Michelle if I\ncould hear the album, and she said no, because Beyonc\xc3\xa9 asked her to\nstop playing it.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBeyonc\xc3\xa9\ncalled you?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI asked, astonished that Michelle knew such a famous musician.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\xa6her\nlawyers called,\xe2\x80\x9d Michelle said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were really angry, and also\nconfused and scared, because Beyonc\xc3\xa9 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually written or\nrecorded the album yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Chad,\nmy former intern who summoned the beagle in order to destroy the\nWorld Government, says that he\nthinks the reversal of his summoning worked. He is no hero, he says,\nbut perhaps he is not a villain either.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\npretty okay, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d Maureen said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least I got my\ninternship credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthen there was Hiram McDaniels\xe2\x80\x99 brave fighting against the strangers.\nIf anything was more powerful than our coming together as a town, it\nwas the brute force of a 18-foot-tall dragon with five heads. He\nfought valiantly for a town he had once threatened, a town who had\nrecently condemned him to death. And we all saw his bravery, and we\nall knew that he must\nbe pardoned.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cPardon\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d we cried.\n\n He\nwas not pardoned. They locked him back up. He is still scheduled for\nexecution.\n\n So,\nperhaps Hiram was the hero?\n\n But\nthere is\xe2\x80\xa6one more theory. One more possible story.\n\n Just\nbefore coming on the air, I felt a presence behind me. It was the\nFaceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t drive them away, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t win. They\nchose\nto leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\nargued that, surely, it was because we or someone forced\nthem.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need a reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey never did. They left, and\nthey may return. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be for any reason, but it could be at any\ntime. They want and need nothing, Cecil. The computer programming,\nand the Dog Park, and Beyonc\xc3\xa9 album, it\xe2\x80\x99s all noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cThey left because they decided to leave. And if they\nreturn, it will be because they decided to return. And it will be\nunrelated to anything we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Night\nVale, we live with the illusion of safety, that we can use caution\nand care in order to preserve our lives. The strangers came and we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why. And then they went, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. We are\nalways in danger. It was just that while they were here, we were made\naware of the danger. They simply revealed to us that personal control\nis an illusion.\n\n We\nlive and die, and we never get to learn any reasons for that.\n\n In\nany case, the strangers are gone. And we can go back to living the\nlie of reason and control once again! And it is a very, very\ncomfortable lie.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for a deep sigh. Deep.\nDeep! No no\nno, deeper than that.\n\n Goodnight,\nNight Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: You can tell a\nlot about someone by coming into our office and confessing everything\nyou know about them.\n\n Kevin:\nHi, friend! It\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin! So many of my old pals from Desert Bluffs\ncame to live here in the desert otherworld with me! We\xe2\x80\x99ve built quite\na little city with roads and a school and a radio station!! I\xe2\x80\x99m back\non the air, Cecil! We even built our new little town to look just\nlike our old\nlittle town! In fact, we just decided to call this new place Desert\nBluffs Too! Too as in also, not the number two. Although we debated\nthat. But we thought it was too charming. We need to build\nto that level of charming. Someday we will! Someday we\xe2\x80\x99ll be so\ncharming, it will hurt.'
