Episode 62 - Hatchets
b'Dare\nto dream. Do it. We dare you. Go ahead, dream.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe fine. We promise.\n\n Welcome\nto Night Vale.\n\n Leann\nHart, publishing editor of the Night Vale Daily Journal, announced\ntoday that, for a limited time, the Daily Journal will print actual\nnewspapers again. No longer will subscribers have only the\nImagination Edition of the daily paper, a compulsory and automatic\n$60 monthly charge to imagine whatever news you want. They will, once\nagain, have the tyranny of a printed daily edition \xe2\x80\x93 where all of\nthe stories are immovable declarations of recent history, told by a\nbiased and underpaid third party.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nan exciting time to work in print journalism!\xe2\x80\x9d Hart shouted after a\nnews blogger who was sprinting away from the hatchet-wielding veteran\nof the printed word.\n\n Hart\nthen hurled another hatchet at the terrified representative of the\nDaily Journal\xe2\x80\x99s digital competition. She hit her target just behind\nthe knee, felling him as he made a sharp cry and a dull asphalt thud.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cVery\nexciting,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart shouted. She added, \xe2\x80\x9cThese printed versions of\nthe daily paper are collector\xe2\x80\x99s items. We\xe2\x80\x99ve deliberately inserted a\nbunch of errors into them because, true collectors know, that makes\nthem worth a bunch more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Listeners,\nI for one think a resurgence in the newspaper industry would be\ngreat. This could mean even more jobs here in Night Vale.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nwill create lots of new jobs for Night Vale,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart will certainly have said by this time tomorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of real awesome\njobs,\xe2\x80\x9d I am sure she will have reiterated.\n\n And\nnow, a look at traffic.\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s\nan accident at the corner of Hollows Road and Great Hills Drive. It\xe2\x80\x99s\na pretty bad accident. It is likely neither party saw an accident of\nthis magnitude coming. Each driver stands, staring, dumbfounded at\ntheir two twisted cars, which look like one. One\xe2\x80\xa6what? Not a car. A\nspiteful burning beast borne of mundane haste and arrogant industrial\nprogress.\n\n The\ntwo drivers cannot comprehend what to do. They are still, mostly.\nFidgeting, sometimes. Thinking, not at all.\n\n A\nneighbor who came out of her house upon hearing the hard smash of\nhard metal can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to process what is happening, either. She\xe2\x80\x99s\nslowly leaning away as if wanting to leave, wanting to forget she\never witnessed this, but she cannot move. She cannot take that first\nstep. Her eyes, growing wide, wild, as her mouth opens, slack at\nfirst, and then slowly recoils into an unheard scream.\n\n The\ntwo drivers feel the neighbor there, but they do not turn. They do\nnot ask for help, or aid. Too scared to move, they stand and gaze\ninto the crumpled slits along the sides of the pressed cars, that\ndamnable block of hot machinery and its black smoke swirls.\n\n And\non the concrete, there is glass. And above the glass are arms, and\nhair, and drying blood. And the drivers stare at their own wretched\nbodies inside the mangled contraptions, and they do not think about\nanything other than what they once were. They watch their bodies,\nhoping for a twitch, a breath, any kind of movement. Hoping for\nanother chance in life.\n\n So,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s backed up pretty bad near the Best Buy. Choose some alternate\nroutes today.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n You\nknow me, listeners. I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty straight and narrow radio\nprofessional. I am all about objectivity and impartiality. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\ntime for a Cecil Palmer Editorial.\n\n Given\nthe growing prevalence of the internet \xe2\x80\x93 not just on computers, but\nalso phones and watches and owls and certain trees \xe2\x80\x93 our private\ninformation is just out there, waiting to be taken and exploited by\nthe wrong kinds of people. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s vitally important that\nVague, Yet Menacing Government Agencies have access to our personal\ndata \xe2\x80\x93 like income, dream journals, phone logs, embarrassing\nthoughts, and slash fiction archives. Ooh, also, the police and the\nworld government. Oh, and the mayor, and\nthe Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in All of Our Homes. Yes,\nthose people should all\nhave access to our private data.\n\n But\nnow, there are things called \xe2\x80\x9cscripts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calgorithms\xe2\x80\x9d that\ncan just scan our emails and our purchase history and all those\nphotos of cats wearing baseball mitts we like to share with each\nother, and these scripts and algorithms are sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cbots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n These\nbots are large cyborgs that break into our homes and look through our\nstuff, and then feed these secrets to corporations and then,\nthese corporations make more bots, and soon, we will have to fight\nbot armies. But with what? Knives and guns are completely\ninternet-based now. They will turn against us in that war. We are not\nsafe from the impending bot wars.\n\n So,\nstop having personal data is what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say. No more emails,\nno more job histories, Night Vale, no more cat pictures, or erotic\nfan fic, or text messages.\n\n I\nknow, I know this is\ndifficult. On the one hand, we enjoy having personal information like\ncareers and friends and hobbies. On the other hand, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking\nabout war.\nAnd on the third eleven-fingered hand, nothing is to say that bots\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be benevolent leaders, but I do not wish to find this out.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsure the naysayers will tell me that I\xe2\x80\x99m overreacting \xe2\x80\x93 which I am,\nbut\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion, OK? You\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get to tell me whose overreacting. You\xe2\x80\x99re underreacting, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsay! Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll totally say that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it right to their face,\nthat\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n What?\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\n\n Oh.\nOh, OK.\n\n Uh,\nlisteners? Intern Maureen just handed me a note explaining that the\nCity Council has just declared all information totally public. And\nthat since no information is private anymore, the giant corporations\nand their bots cannot harm us by mining private data. The city will\nkeep all our information safely out in the open, and available to\nanyone wearing sunglasses and a sidearm.\n\n Hey,\nthanks Maureen!\n\n Moments\nago, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police held a secret press conference\nreminding us that all murder is illegal. Also, attempted murder.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLike,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s say you try to kill a person, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t actually\nsucceed,\xe2\x80\x9d a Secret Police spokesperson whispered from behind a\nconcrete pillar in the underground garage of the disused East Night\nVale Mall. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, that\xe2\x80\x99s still\nillegal, even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill that person.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\nwhat if you just think\nabout killing a person but don\xe2\x80\x99t actually do it?\xe2\x80\x9d came one question\nfrom the batch of reporters, who were also whispering and hiding.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal, then\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesperson whispered in reply.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\nI have it all planned out and everything!\xe2\x80\x9d the reporter continued.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just haven\xe2\x80\x99t done it yet. Is that illegal?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s just mean, and kind of weird,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Secret Police\nspokesperson before walking out into the open and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLeann,\nis that you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cUmm,\nno! No. Noo. NOOOO!\xe2\x80\x9d\ncame a comically deep voice that was obviously fake. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\nme at all! I\xe2\x80\x99m just an old bagel wrapper someone left on the ground!\nI\xe2\x80\x99m inanimate garbage!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLeann,\nwe know it\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spokesperson. \xe2\x80\x9cStop attacking\nbloggers with hatchets! We found a dozen more wounded bloggers in\nMission Grove Park this morning! They all had hatchets in their\nbacks, and were very upset. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice, Leann! It\xe2\x80\x99s also illegal,\nOK?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a bagel\nwrapper, you\xe2\x80\xa6jerk!\xe2\x80\x9d Hart\nreplied, still whispering and hiding.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsor.\n\n You\nare thirsty. Of course you are. We are all metaphorically thirsty for\nbetter things, but you are literally\nthirsty. Literally thirsty for anything. You could feel your dry\nlips, swollen and sticking together, their crusted gray edges\nadorning the pink pain beneath. You lick your lips, felling better\nfor a moment, but actually worsening the problem.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nhot, right? Pretty hot and dry, actually.\n\n Are\nthose flies? Yes. Those are flies.\n\n Are\nthose birds\xe2\x80\xa6vultures? Yes. Actual vultures in your home.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHow\ndid these soaring scavengers get in my home?\xe2\x80\x9d you think.\n\n Perhaps\nyou could use some cool, pure, natural and refreshing Fiji Water.\nYes, Fiji Water sounds sooo nice,\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n\n But\nFiji Water is not who is sponsoring this show. Fiji Water doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\neven know about this\nshow. Who is sponsoring this show? We cannot tell you. We\xe2\x80\x99re not\nallowed.\n\n Fiji\nWater is completely unaware of you, too.\n\n So\nsorry, this will not end quickly. So very, very sorry.\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsor.\n\n This\nafternoon, Night Vale High School and the armed militia that make up\nour Committee for Civic Pride are holding a ticker tape parade for\nlocal sports hero Michael Sandero, who became the first Night Vale\nHigh athlete to play in a college football national title game.\n\n Unfortunately,\nSandero\xe2\x80\x99s team, the University of Michigan Wolverines [ed.\nnote: Cecil still pronounces it \xe2\x80\x9cMitchigan\xe2\x80\x9d],\nlost to copies of themselves in the title game. But Sandero did win\nthe Heisman Trophy for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s best college football player, and\ndid his hometown proud.\n\n Intern\nMaureen, who I sent to report on the parade\xe2\x80\xa6oh\xe2\x80\xa6is texting me that\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word that Leann Hart has\ninterrupted the festivities with an announcement.\n\n Oh,\nwow. According to Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s flurry of texts, Hart is claiming that\nMichigan did not play\nitself for the title. As proof of her claim, Hart passed out copies\nof a news article from the Michigan Daily from January 13, stating\nthat at the end of the season, Michigan lost\nmore games than they won, and that their quarterback\xe2\x80\x99s name is Devin\nGardner? Not Michael Sandero.\n\n On\nthe front page of that issue of the Daily is a headline strongly\nindicating that people at the University of Michigan can remember\nmost things correctly. Pretty\nMuch No Major Memory Problems Here,\nthe headline reads.\n\n She\nalso claims that a school called Ohio State [ed. note:\nCecil pronounces Ohio as Oh-hee-oh]\nwon the national title over a school called Oregon [ed.\nnote: Cecil pronounces it Or-ee-gone].\n\n Maureen\nconfirmed that while Ohio is, in fact, a U.S. state, Michigan and\nOregon are neither states nor cities anyone seems to have heard of\nbefore. We\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to figure out their languages of origin.\n\n Maureen\nis texting me that Hart is now shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBlogger!\xe2\x80\x9d over and over.\nMaureen is texting me that Hart is hurling hatchets now, Maureen is\ntexting me that everyone looks pretty scared, Maureen just texted me,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Um,\nlet\xe2\x80\x93 let me\xe2\x80\xa6let me respond really quick.\n\n Is\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\xa6slang\xe2\x80\xa6or\nsomething\xe2\x80\xa6Maureen?\n\n OK,\nshe texted back, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hit, she got me, I\xe2\x80\x99m bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Um,\nuh\xe2\x80\xa6[exasperated sigh]\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand young people and their weird text-speak at all. Who\neven knows what she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to say? Well, whatever.\n\n While\nI text Maureen back with a quick grammar lesson, let me take you to\nthe weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cAnarchy\nDate\xe2\x80\x9d by Queer\nRocket]\n\n Listeners,\nI have just learned that Maureen was struck with a hatchet thrown by\nLeann Hart.\n\n So,\nthen:\n\n To\nthe family of Intern Maureen, she was a good intern. A valiant\nintern. Brave, right up until the end. Sadly, she is with us no more.\nShe will be missed.\n\n For\nthe hatchet attack on Maureen, as well as several other attacks at\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s parade, and more than five dozen similar hatchet-based\nassaults in the past several weeks, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police\narrested Leann Hart.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\ntold you it was illegal to kill people, Leann!\xe2\x80\x9d the Sheriff himself\nsaid from his hover-office in the clouds. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd also, to try to kill\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nthey were news bloggers!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHart replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay in business and create jobs if news\nbloggers are putting me out of business and destroying those jobs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nthe Sheriff agreed, saying it\xe2\x80\x99s the Secret Police\xe2\x80\x99s job to protect\nbusiness interests, as well as citizen interests. The City Council\nalso agreed. So did the Vague, Yet Menacing Government Agency,\nnodding quietly from inside their long, black sedans with tinted\nwindows, while snapping photos of everything they saw.\n\n The\nmayor did not agree.\nMayor Dana Cardinal went against the City Council and said that she,\nfor one, did not think people or businesses should be allowed to use\nphysical violence against their competition or anyone,\nfor that matter.\n\n The\nCity Council bristled, and then they all squawked and few away.\n\n It\nis unclear whether or not news bloggers agree, as many of them have\ngone silent on this issue, replacing their investigative reports and\nthink pieces with pictures of cats wearing baseball gloves and\ntop-rated recipes for invisible pie.\n\n The\nSheriff then announced that all charges against Hart would be\ndropped, except for\nthe assault on Intern Maureen.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaureen,\nafter all, was not a\nnews blogger, but a radio intern who posed no direct threat to Hart\xe2\x80\x99s\nnewspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sheriff said.\n\n And\nI agreed.\n\n The\nSheriff then played the entirety of Domenico Galli\xe2\x80\x99s Sonata\nQuinta on his gold cello.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\xa6but\nshe looked like a\nblogger,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was typing into her phone. All\nthose bloggers do that! Bloggers love\ntyping on their phones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut\nshe worked in radio, Leann,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sheriff said, as he ended a series\nof lilting high notes with a single discordant bass tone. He closed\nhis eyes and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but that is attempted\nmurder. You have to go to jail now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\nBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to kill\nher! You said murder and attempted murder were illegal. Murder wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\nmy intent!\xe2\x80\x9d Leann said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThen\nwhat was your intent?\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe Sheriff asked.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\njust\xe2\x80\xa6throwing a hatchet at her.. Nothing more, nothing less,\xe2\x80\x9d\nHart said. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant nothing by it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, brushing her hands\ntogether, and then holding them out, empty and clean. Her open palms\nsignified \xe2\x80\x9ccase closed.\xe2\x80\x9d And the Sheriff, held to the higher law\nof gestures, had no choice but to acquiesce.\n\n So\nHart was set free, turned back into the world to print more news, to\nkeep the industry alive.\n\n Before\nshe left, she paused and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong in\nMichigan\xe2\x80\x9d [ed. note: quoting Leann, Cecil pronounces it\nas it is normally pronounced outside of Night Vale \xe2\x80\x93 when not\nquoting her, he continues to pronounce it \xe2\x80\x9cMitchigan\xe2\x80\x9d] \xe2\x80\x93\nand, listeners, that\xe2\x80\x99s how she said it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, it\xe2\x80\x99s very\nclear how it\xe2\x80\x99s actually pronounced if you see it written out \xe2\x80\x93 and\nshe held up her copy of the Michigan Daily from January 13 with an\narticle that said, \xe2\x80\x9cMichigan,\nSandero, Lose Close One To Themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd the front page of the Michigan Daily now showed a bold headline,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe Have Forgotten So\nMany Things,\xe2\x80\x9d and in\nseveral blank columns with no story, merely pictures of normal things\nlike shoes and birds and ghosts, all captioned with a series of\nfrantic question marks.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\nguess I was wrong earlier. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Weird,\nright?\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said with a shrug.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThat\nis crazy weird,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sheriff agreed, finishing out the sonata\nbefore disappearing in a soft breeze.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6agree!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid a nearby news blogger who was coughing up blood and clutching\ntightly to the hatchet lodged in her abdomen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6wait\xe2\x80\xa6to\nblog\xe2\x80\xa6about it!\xe2\x80\x9d the blogger\nsaid through gritted teeth.\n\n Leann\ntightened her grip on the hatchet in her left hand, raising it\nslightly. There was a tense pause that was eventually broken by a\nlight smirk from Leann Hart. Then, the two of them laughed and\nlaughed. They are both still laughing now.\n\n Because\nof the hatchet attack she survived today, Intern Maureen has resigned\nfrom radio \xe2\x80\x93 as I clearly, \xc2\xa0and without any other possible\ninterpretation, explained earlier.\n\n Oh,\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that badly, but Maureen went on and on about radio\nbeing a \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous job\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctotally not worth the constant\nrisk of death.\xe2\x80\x9d I told her she makes it harder than it needs to be.\nShe rolled her eyes, and packed up her desk.\n\n I\nmiss her already. She had a good sense of humor.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for something clawing at your window. It will also be\nsniffing. Sniffing and clawing at your window. Occasionally, it will\nwail. Occasionally, you will hear nothing. So, to recap: sniffing and\nclawing at your window over and over, with the occasional piercing\nwail, and then long silences. All that, next.\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Ask your doctor just who he thinks he is. Say it just like\nthat. Say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho do you think you are?\xe2\x80\x9d See if he starts crying. I\nknow I would.'
