Act like all of nature. Act like the entire cycle of life and death and change and rebirth.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Guess what day it is today, listeners! It\xe2\x80\x99s parade day!\n\n\n Remember how I told you about the not-at-all-secret parade today at the location we discussed via radio? Remember I publicly announced today\xe2\x80\x99s parade at that specific location? And I announced it, not in a tapped-out code underneath the basketball highlights, but completely in a clear and spoken language? We want\xc2\xa0everyone\xc2\xa0at today\xe2\x80\x99s parade, at that time and place we discussed.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - - \xc2\xa0 . . \xc2\xa0 - . - \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 - . . \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0 - . - - \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . . - \xc2\xa0 . - . - . -]\n\n\n There will be lots of things happening! Planned things,\xc2\xa0strategic\xc2\xa0things. There will be some special guests, that are\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0teenage fugitives named Tamika Flynn. She won\xe2\x80\x99t be there, and thus could not\xc2\xa0possibly\xc2\xa0organize any community insurgency at all! She\xe2\x80\x99s a fugitive, wanted for destruction of StrexCorp property, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to show up and ruin our parade day by leading a helicopter rebellion against what she calls \xe2\x80\x93 her words, not mine \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ca dystopian corpocratic regime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0. - . \xc2\xa0 . . \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 . . - \xc2\xa0 . - - . \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 . . \xc2\xa0 - - . \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 . \xc2\xa0 - \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 - \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 . - . . \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 . - . - . -]\n\n\n Nope! I would\xc2\xa0never\xc2\xa0want to bring down the malevolent [coughing fit] mmm \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0benevolent corporation that owns our station! In fact, if you see Tamika Flynn, you should probably follow her, and listen closely to what she says to you. Not so you can help overthrow StrexCorp,\xc2\xa0of course! Not that at all.\n\n\n Follow Tamika Flynn.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0. - . \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - . . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - . - . \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - . - - \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 . . \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 . - - - - \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . . - \xc2\xa0 . - .]\n\n\n See you at parade day!\n\n\n In other news, a series of one-sided doors have begun appearing around town. Tom\xc3\xa1s Perez, head of Perez Accounting, said an old oak door, with a brass knob, appeared overnight in his office. It\xe2\x80\x99s right in front of the doorway of the supply closet. He said he went to get supplies this morning for a staff meeting \xe2\x80\x93 pens, markers, a legal pad, some antivenom \xe2\x80\x93 but accidentally opened the wrong door, revealing several men and women standing in a bright desert hellscape, holding swords and sticks, and even a few rifles.\n\n\n Tom\xc3\xa1s stared at them. They stared at Tom\xc3\xa1s. One of the barbaric figures put a finger to her lips, and shook her head \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d Another reached in, grabbed the door, and slowly closed it, keeping eye contact with Tom\xc3\xa1s the whole way.\n\n\n Claire Wallace, a freelance photographer, sent in photos of a door that appeared in the empty lot across from the Rec Center. In one photo, the door is cracked open, and there is an elderly woman near it. I cannot see her face. She is putting up a sign that reads \xe2\x80\x9cFuture home of the Old Night Vale Opera House.\xe2\x80\x9d And in another photo she is walking toward the door. Her face is still obscured. In the last photo, the door is shut, and she is gone. I can see the words \xe2\x80\x9cJosephina Contracters, Inc.\xe2\x80\x9d in small print across the bottom of the sign.\n\n\n Juanita Jefferson, head of neighborhood improvement organization Night Vale or Nothing, said one such door appeared in her back yard. One side seemed to be an old oak door, with a brass knob. On the other side there was\xe2\x80\xa6nothing. She could see no door at all. Juanita said she opened the door from the visible side and saw a vast sandy wasteland, and nearby mountains \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are just illusions,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. Atop one of the \xe2\x80\x9cmountains\xe2\x80\x9d in the door was a lighthouse. She said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see any trees.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cTrees,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are us,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, waving her hand lazily in the air, as if to shoo away a very slow bee.\n\n\n Reporters then noticed a very slow bee spiraling sluggishly, but recklessly, away from the scene.\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n Take a look at your life. What do you see?\n\n\n Nothing, right? You can see nothing at all. Oh, sure, you\xc2\xa0think\xc2\xa0you see a series of flashes and flickers, of shapes and shades of color. You think you see familiar things like faces and letters, and walls, and your own hands.\n\n\n Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar at all.\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen any of that before. Your hands aren\xe2\x80\x99t even your own. Whose hands are they? Who are\xc2\xa0you? Is this what it is like to die? Are you dying? If not, when? And\xc2\xa0where\xc2\xa0will you die? Where and when were you born, even?\n\n\n Wait \xe2\x80\x93 how did you forget your place and date of birth? I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend the relentlessness of existence, but your own birthday is pretty easy to remember!\n\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99ve got more problems than we thought, listener.\n\n\n OK, fine. Your birthday is July 3rd, and your birthplace was Tulsa, Oklahoma. Feel better?\n\n\n You don\xe2\x80\x99t, actually. You feel nothing, because your hands were never your own. You are imagining everything, and perceiving nothing.\n\n\n At least you smell nice. We can at least tell you that.\n\n\n Irish Spring. Whose hands\xc2\xa0are\xc2\xa0these?\n\n\n Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at traffic.\n\n\n There are roads. Upon those roads are cars. Some moving, in straight or gently-curved lines. Some idling, in long, narrow crowds. And inside those cars are people. People who are moving, or idling, with their cars. One with their vehicles, sitting quietly, peacefully in plush chairs, hands resting outward on a circle that dictates direction. From the side, and seen without the car, they would look almost fetal. So vulnerable, these people, nestled in their protective outer shells.\n\n\n Are we living a life that is safe from harm?\n\n\n Of course not. We never are. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the right question. The question is are we living a life that is\xc2\xa0worth\xc2\xa0the harm?\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - . \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - . . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - . - . \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - . - - \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - .]\n\n\n We are all driving toward something. We are all driving away from something else. It is\xe2\x80\xa6the simplicity of physics. The simplicity of free will.\n\n\n Expect delays as you near the parade day exit, but do not change route.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0. . \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0 - \xc2\xa0 . - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 - . - - \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0 - \xc2\xa0 . - . \xc2\xa0 . \xc2\xa0 - . . -]\n\n\n Stay your course.\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re getting more updates about those doors. In fact, I have a very important scientist on the phone right now. He\xe2\x80\x99s at the very top of his field, a really handsome scientist!\n\n\n\n\n Stop!\n\n\n\n\n Hi, Carlos! So, you said you saw these new doors.\n\n\n\n\n Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m here with my research team at the house that does not exist in the Desert Creek housing development. The one that looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s there, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t there? Our previous attempts to understand the home were futile. From the windows it looks completely empty, but when you try to go inside, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fully furnished home and a woman named Cynthia living there.\n\n\n But today, all of the composite fiberglass doors on the house suddenly changed. They\xe2\x80\x99re now all old oak doors with brass knobs, and when we opened one, we finally saw the empty house that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing through the windows.\n\n\n If you go inside the home from these new doors, you can explore the house that does not exist,\xc2\xa0but\xc2\xa0you cannot return unless someone is on the other side of the door you went through.\n\n\n One of our scientists, Rachelle, went through, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get back out! We only thought she was inside for about 45 minutes, but when we opened the door back up, she ran out saying she\xe2\x80\x99d been trapped for several hours! She was sweating and starving, and she ate every one of the kolaches Dave made for us.\n\n\n So now, we just need to do more experiments. We have to be careful, because time is weird in Night Vale. But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do a bit of exploring in this house, and get back to you and your listeners about what is going on here.\n\n\n\n\n Carlos? Do be careful!\n\n\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, Cecil! I have a team of five talented scientists with me. They will be here to check on my progress and keep me from getting trapped. Without them, of course, it would be much more dangerous. But I am not without them. Not at all.\n\n\n\n\n Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re very brave.\n\n\n\n\n Thanks, Cecil.\n\n\n\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re going to get to the bottom of this door story for you, listeners! Because we have science on our side!\n\n\n Outgoing mayor Pamela Winchell called another press conference today. Most of her press conferences are not newsworthy, as she calls\xc2\xa0everything\xc2\xa0she does a press conference. Lunch, getting a new end table, screaming into street-side mailboxes, testing the surface tension of low-flying birds\xe2\x80\xa6basically, any simple activity we all do daily, she is trying to make into news.\n\n\n This\xc2\xa0morning, however, while complaining about the unfair mayoral election process in Night Vale, where all votes are discarded in favor of a pronouncement from Hidden Gorge, Mayor Winchell saw a door appear in her office at City Hall. When she opened the oak door with the brass knob, she said she saw an angel. Tall, and beautiful, and radiating dark light and operatic music. Mayor Winchell turned to the few remaining reporters who still attend her press conferences and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAngels are\xc2\xa0real! I am staring at one right now! They are\xc2\xa0real, OK?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She began to open the door wide to show the press, but the figure \xe2\x80\x93 who was certainly not an angel \xe2\x80\x93 mouthed \xe2\x80\x9cShut up, Pamela!\xe2\x80\x9d at Mayor Winchell.\n\n\n The alleged angel added, \xe2\x80\x9cShhhhhh! Geeeeeeez!\xe2\x80\x9d and slammed the door.\n\n\n Pamela corrected her previous announcement by vehemently denying the existence of angels \xe2\x80\x93 but hinting that mountains\xc2\xa0might be a thing.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know! Think about it!\xe2\x80\x9d she mused, as she continued slicing off chunks of her mahogany desk with a Bowie knife.\n\n\n [Morse code, not so much in the background this time:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n Parade day has finally begun, listeners!\n\n\n Come to the parade grounds and see what kind of colors and noise a proud community can make!\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n I am told now that 13 year-old Tamika Flynn is, in fact, at the parade. She has, in fact,\xc2\xa0been\xc2\xa0at the parade all along. I am telling this now to my producer Daniel, who is throwing chairs in the control room. I am telling this now to my producer Daniel, who I have\xc2\xa0locked\xc2\xa0in the control room.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n I am showing my producer Daniel that I am running the show from my own mixer, as he stares dumbly at the cables he just yanked from the walls.\n\n\n The parade, as you know, as\xc2\xa0you\xc2\xa0have known all along, is at StrexCorp headquarters along the lip of Radon Canyon. The parade consists of half a dozen yellow helicopters, all of which have been commandeered by Tamika\xe2\x80\x99s band of well-read middle schoolers, who left town months ago to train for\xc2\xa0this moment.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n They apparently learned to fly the helicopters by reading books. Specifically, they learned by reading Italo Calvino's\xc2\xa0Invisible Cities, and a collection of Shirley Jackson\xc2\xa0short stories.\n\n\n Never underestimate the power of good literature.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n Listeners, this is one of the great moments in Night Vale history. And here is our chance to be part of it. Not since our town elders first donned soft meat crowns, and wrote our town charter in their own blood on the side of a\xc2\xa0confused\xc2\xa0coyote has this town had the chance to witness the birth of a truly new age.\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n Witnesses are reporting helicopters above StrexCorp. Witnesses are reporting pre-teens carrying slingshots, and wearing several Reading Achievement chevrons on their left breast pockets.\n\n\n Witnesses are reporting a bumbling swarm of StrexCorp security agents unable to contain the small revolution!\n\n\n Witnesses are reporting a dumbfounded and vile institution collapsing under the bloated weight of its own greed!\n\n\n I\xc2\xa0am reporting that I am barricading my door from the Strex-owned station management, while making faces at Daniel, trapped in the booth.\n\n\n And while you fight, Night Vale,\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0Night Vale, for your town, for your home, I take you now, triumphant citizens, to the weather!\n\n\n [Morse code in background:\xc2\xa0- . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - \xc2\xa0 - . \xc2\xa0 - - - \xc2\xa0 . - -]\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cTake Up Your Spade\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0Sara Watkins]\n\n\n As usual, Night Vale, a lot happened during the weather. And we missed it. Not because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t reporting on it, but because we were not there to experience it.\n\n\n Witnesses are reporting what they saw today.\n\n\n But no witnesses\xc2\xa0joined in.\n\n\n The witnesses, weak and watching, only witnessed.\n\n\n Listeners\xe2\x80\xa6ooooh, listeners. The band of well-read child revolutionaries, including their leader and only hero our town had left, Tamika Flynn, have been captured by a StrexCorp security team. Tamika led a great revolt to rid our town of a terrible evil, and restore the original\xc2\xa0less-terrible evil that preceded it. But no one showed up. They only\xc2\xa0watched.\n\n\n She called to you!\xc2\xa0I\xc2\xa0called to\xc2\xa0you, Night Vale! But there just weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough of us.\n\n\n The children were all sent to the Juvenile Detention Center, which has sat empty for years because of the specially-calibrated school lunches, formulated by the Night Vale Psychological Association.\n\n\n Tamika, just before her arrest, calmly waved a heavily-notated copy of Bertolt Brecht's\xc2\xa0Life of Galileo. She then paraphrased the influential German playwright saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSad is not the land that has no hero. Sad is the land that\xc2\xa0needs\xc2\xa0a hero.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n An officer took the book and slid it into a plastic bag, as Tamika was handcuffed and led into the back of a bright yellow police cruiser with orange triangle logos.\n\n\n Night Vale\xe2\x80\xa6Night Vale. I tried to tell you about this day. I was very clear. Tamika was very clear. We could have\xc2\xa0done\xc2\xa0something, Night Vale, but we\xe2\x80\xa6chose not to. Not\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0citizen outside of Tamika and her band of brilliant, brave,\xc2\xa0children\xc2\xa0stood up to tyranny today! We\xc2\xa0all\xc2\xa0chose to stand down, and\xc2\xa0hope\xc2\xa0change would be won\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0us, and not\xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0us! By someone else, we believed. A hero, we believed.\n\n\n But belief is only step one.\xc2\xa0Action\xc2\xa0is step two. Fighting for what you believe is step two. Solidarity is step two. Unity is step two. We did\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0take step two today, Night Vale!\n\n\n And now there will be no step three!\n\n\n We have failed Tamika. But worse, we have failed ourselves.\n\n\n I'm\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Um\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve got guests in my studio. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they undid my secret barricade made of cardboard signs that said \xe2\x80\x9cKEEP OUT!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSECRET ROOM!\xe2\x80\x9d in all caps with an exclamation point, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my program director, Lauren, and some man I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen bef\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n But no, I\xc2\xa0have\xc2\xa0seen him before! Where have I seen you before?\n\n\n They do not look happy, Night Vale. Lauren and the\xc2\xa0stranger\xc2\xa0are smiling widely, their teeth white, lips pink, their eyes full but tight, deep dimples making their tiny noses into parenthetical asides,\xc2\xa0they are smiling, but they look very unhappy.\n\n\n Perhaps it is, uhh, time to sign off for the day. Um, I am sure to speak to you again very soon, listeners.\n\n\n Stay tuned next for the gentle sounds of forgiveness, and a lilting melody of wounds healing, and until next time, goodnight, Night Vale\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n Hey! Hey! What are you\xe2\x80\x93 Ge\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n [Morse code in background during end credits:\xc2\xa0. . - . \xc2\xa0 . - \xc2\xa0 . - . . \xc2\xa0 . - . . \xc2\xa0 . . - - - \xc2\xa0 - - - - - \xc2\xa0 . - - - - \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 . .]\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: If you love something, set it free.
