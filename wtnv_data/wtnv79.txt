Episode 68 - Faceless Old Women
b"Get the body\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted. We know where it\xe2\x80\x99s buried, and can lend you a\nshovel.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\n\n Hello, listeners.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m back from vacation, and I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling great! I, of course,\nmiss being with Carlos in that desert otherworld, and miss having so\nmuch time to relax with my boyfriend, but \xe2\x80\x93 as with any vacation \xe2\x80\x93\nit always feels good to come home.\n\n We had such a\ndelightful time. Carlos and the masked army of nomadic giants that\ninhabit that place have managed to build a little paradise there.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s now a roller coaster, and an ice cream parlor, and a beach\nresort hotel and spa! Unfortunately, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have operators for\nthe roller coaster, nor any milk for making ice cream, nor any water\nalong the beach resort. So, most of those things just sit empty.\n\n Except for the\nroller coaster, which is constantly running, and filled with the same\npeople who got on it over two months ago, unable to stop because no\none knew how to build a brake system. There were terrified screams\nDopplering up and down the otherwise quiet nights. Those people are\njust having the time of the rest of their lives!\n\n More on my trip\nlater, but first, some breaking news.\n\n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s\nSecret Police just announced that they have captured the Faceless Old\nWoman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home. The Faceless Old Woman is one\nof two fugitives the Secret Police have been tracking for the past\nfew months. She, and literal five-headed dragon Hiram McDaniels, are\nwanted in connection with a series of attacks on mayor Dana Cardinal\nat City Hall.\n\n A Secret Police\nspokesdeer made today\xe2\x80\x99s big announcement by writing it in dirt with\nits hoof. The announcement began a couple of hours ago, but we\xe2\x80\x99re\njust now getting to the good stuff. And reporters have grown\nimpatient with the spokesdeer, who can only scratch one or two words\nat a time, and then has to erase them before continuing with the next\nwords.\n\n The\npress conference turned ugly, as a couple of reporters shouted \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak\nEnglish!\xe2\x80\x9d at the deer. But then, a couple more shouted,\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xd0\x9f\xd0\xbe-\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand the spokesdeer, looking relieved, began speaking in fluent\nRussian \xe2\x80\x93 which flummoxed those reporters who only spoke English,\ndespite their adamant demands that others develop a mastery of\nmultiple languages.\n\n But the big news\nis that they captured a dangerous fugitive, which is so shocking\nbecause, to my knowledge, no one has ever seen the Faceless\nOld Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home \xe2\x80\x93 because she lives there\nsecretly. Of course, without a face, I imagine it would be\nsimultaneously easy and difficult to identify her.\n\n More on this\nstory as it develops.\n\n OK. So. Back to\nour vacation.\n\n Carlos showed me\nthe apartment he built using his scientific knowledge of physical\nmaterials and spatial relations. It was a cute little one-bedroom on\nthe side of a low craggy mountain.\n\n Yeah, I know, I\ncould hardly believe it! A mountain, right?\n\n We took turns\nmaking each other breakfast whenever we thought it was morning.\nCarlos cooks a delicious vegan omelette using thick fillets of ginger\nroot for the eggs, and filling it with dried cranberries and capers.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m not a great\ncook, but I make excellent coffee. I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t let Carlos make\nthe coffee because I have a specific way I like to make it using a\ncoffee hammer and angry chanting. I like my coffee like I like my\nnights: dark, endless, and impossible to sleep through.\n\n After a week\xe2\x80\x99s\nstay-cation in Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 apartment, we went with the giant masked\nwarrior Alisha on several hiking trails around the desert canyons.\nCarlos and Alisha showed me the brilliant array of flora that grows\nin that desert otherworld. While the desert around Night Vale is\nmostly red and brown dust, with a smattering of white and brown\nrocks, topped with gray and brown brush, the canyons of the desert\notherworld are flush with rich brush of charcoal and tan, rocks the\ncolor of snow and leather, and dust that was striped in shades of\nsunset and mahogany.\n\n And there were\nmysterious lights in the sky. Just like here in Night Vale. We could\nnot understand the lights, but we understood our lack of\nunderstanding. Which is all most understanding is.\n\n Some mornings,\nAlisha and Doug and the other giant masked warriors would see other\nmasked armies, and they would head off to war, gone for days at a\ntime, only to return bloodied \xe2\x80\x93 and fewer in number. Carlos and I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, because it gave us more time to ourselves.\n\n Oh! More about\nour vacation later, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some news, or something.\n\n An update on\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s arrest of the Faceless Old Woman:\n\n Several residents\nacross Night Vale are reporting vandalism inside their homes. Old\nTown residents Christopher Brady and Stewart Robinson report their\nliving room walls were covered in writing that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cYou talked!\nI see you, and I cannot hate you, but I cannot forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d The\ntext seems to have been written with hand-smeared mayonnaise.\n\n Also, all of the\ntoes were cut out of their dress socks.\n\n Said Robinson of\nthe damage, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s because I reported to the Sheriff that\nthe Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Our Home was secretly\nliving in our home. I regret this now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Brady added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\ntold you not to do that, Stewart!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Robinson then\nreplied, head in his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Chris. You were right! You\xe2\x80\x99re\nalways right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nshould have listened to Christopher,\xe2\x80\x9d came a cold\nwhisper over their shoulders.\n\n Stay tuned here\nas we bring you more news of today\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.\n\n And now, it\xe2\x80\x99s\ntime for another edition of my popular advice segment, \xe2\x80\x9cHey There,\nCecil.\xe2\x80\x9d Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to your questions.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there,\nCecil! I date a lot of people, but never for very long. I find that\nwhile I sometimes say \xe2\x80\x98I love you\xe2\x80\x99 to my girlfriend or boyfriend at\nthe time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have ever meant it. How do you know if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re in love?\xe2\x80\x9d Signed, Loveless in the Barista District.\n\n Hey there,\nLoveless. I think when you\xe2\x80\x99re truly in love, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know it. But you\nhave to be in the right place with yourself to find that love. As my\nmother used to tell me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t learn to love others until you\nlearn that others are fiction, and that self is unreliable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Next question.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there,\nCecil. My husband and I regularly host dinner parties for our\nneighbors, and vice versa. When our neighbors come over to the house,\nthey never take off their shoes. I, personally, don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem\nwith that, but my husband thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s rude. What\xe2\x80\x99s your take?\xe2\x80\x9d\nSigned, Unshod in Old Town.\n\n Hey there,\nUnshod. Whoo! This is, uh, pretty clear cut to me. It is customary,\nwhen you enter a person\xe2\x80\x99s home, that you must always remove your\nshoes. Then you must remove their shoes. You must hold that\nperson down, take their shoes \xe2\x80\x93 just get their shoes off! This is\nstandard etiquette.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve got time\nfor one more question.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there,\nCecil. Do you know the tower? The one that casts no shadow? It also\nsounds like an un-tuned cello? Do you know the one? Smells like\nsulfur? Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s glowing now.\xe2\x80\x9d Signed, Malevolent in Mission\nGrove Park.\n\n Hey there,\nMalevolent. You know as well as I do, that tower was destroyed a\ncentury ago. Never write me again!\n\n [Whispered:] Please write me\nagain!\n\n Old Woman Josie\nand her friends, who are not angels \xe2\x80\x93 just a bunch of really tall\npeople with wings named Erika whom we cannot bear to look directly at\n\xe2\x80\x93 said that the New Old Night Vale Opera House was coming along\nnicely. Although I drove past the construction site the other day,\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s still a mostly empty lot. The only difference is that they\nchanged the sign from \xe2\x80\x9cJosefina Contractors, Inc.\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cStrexCorp\nOperatics, Ltd.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Also, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\ngiant opera house there.\n\n But, other than\nthat, it still looks nearly the same as when they broke ground months\nago.\n\n Opening night of\nthe New Old Opera House will be June 15th, and will feature the world\npremiere of an original opera by the famous actor and composer, Lee\nMarvin \xe2\x80\x93 Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s own immortal legend of stage and screen.\n\n Still\nno word on what an\nopera is. Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m being told it\xe2\x80\x99s like\na petting zoo, but with fewer starving wolves. And more\nintermissions.\n\n Breaking news\nfrom City Hall as the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police say they have now\narrested more than a dozen Faceless Old Women. The spokesdeer, still\nspeaking in Russian for the Russian-speaking press, while also\nwriting English words in the dirt for the embittered English-speaking\npress, say that the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your\nHome seems to be several bodies connected to a single sentience.\n\n She seems not to\nbe omnipresent at all; merely multi-present. The Secret Police\nspokesdeer then laughed in Russian, while writing \xe2\x80\x9chehehe\xe2\x80\x9d in\nEnglish in the dirt.\n\n Faceless Old Woman [a very faint whisper]: You\xe2\x80\x99re betraying me, Cecil.\n\n Cecil: Oh! Oh dear,\nthat's\xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not true! I\xe2\x80\x93 OK.\n\n [Wet chewing sound fades in]\n\n Now\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6very long insect\xe2\x80\xa6crawling into my ear. Um\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s all\nth\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s all the way in my ear now! Um, I am not\nOK with this, Faceless Old Woman!\n\n Faceless Old\nWoman?\n\n Ah! Aah!\n\n Listeners, hang\non while I get this silverfish out of my ear canal.\n\n [Cecil sighs, then there are\nsounds of a struggle and several gunshots, then a whining sound like\nan injured dog]\n\n OK. OK. Um,\nso\xe2\x80\xa6traffic.\n\n [Cecil continues to sound\ndistressed as he speaks]\n\n Um, it looks\npretty bad out there. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a jackknifed 18-wheeler on the\nshoulder of westbound Route 800 near Exit 4, causing serious delays,\nand the bus depot on Somerset, um\xe2\x80\xa6a fire hydrant was cracked open,\nand now space and time have colla\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\nlisteners, I\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m taking my headphones off. I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m having a hard\ntime hearing myself. I think the Faceless Old Woman really did damage\nto my ear! Anyway, traffic\xe2\x80\x99s awful, of course. Always is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t drive\non Somerset unless you want all of your matter collapsing into a\nsingularity.\n\n Ugh, r\xe2\x80\x93 r\xe2\x80\x93\nreally glad to be home. Great homecoming!\n\n An update now on\nthe multiple arrests of the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in\nYour Home: apparently they\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to find 15 more versions of her\nin homes all over town. But, according to the spokesdeer, the Secret\nPolice are running out of room in the jails.\n\n Also, even at the\nhomes where they have arrested these Faceless Old Women, there are\nstill reported cases of vandalism, and whispers, and suggested\nviolence, and sudden but inscrutable movements in the corners of\nvision. In fact, these reporters are happening even in homes where an\narrest of the Faceless Old Woman had already been made.\n\n Many city\nbuildings, especially the Secret Police\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police Station,\nhidden in a hover cloud, have received quite a bit of damage: bird\nparts in filing cabinets, bullets replaced with worms, badges reading\n\xe2\x80\x9cRotted Meat\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cSecret Police.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Mayor Dana\nCardinal has called on the police to temporarily cease their\ncrackdown on the Faceless Old Woman. The mayor claims she\xe2\x80\x99s been\nterrorized by falling televisions and window-mounted A.C. units, as\nwell as all of the carpet in her City Hall office being replaced by\ndark, heaving fur, as if the floor were now the back of some terrible\nbeast.\n\n Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nnot falling for this bit again! Mayor Cardinal, once my friend, has\nabused my good nature too much. She bought me at an auction, and has\nsince been using me against my will to rescue her from danger.\n\n Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s just\ngoing to have to figure it out on her own this time.\n\n Faceless Old Woman [another barely-audible whisper]: I\xe2\x80\x99m here, Cecil. Shh.\n\n [The sound of the silverfish can\nagain be heard]\n\n Ow! Gr\xe2\x80\x93 gross!\nStop it, Faceless Old Woman, stop it!\n\n Weather. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go\nto the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cMatches\xe2\x80\x9d\nby Sifu\nHotman]\n\n Well. I have\ncotton swabs in both ears now, listeners, and am more than a little\nbit irritated. But on with the news.\n\n The Secret Police\njust retracted their earlier reports that they had captured the\nFaceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home. They thought they\nhad been arresting several corporeal forms of her across town, but in\nactuality they had just been arresting a bunch of faceless old women\nwho openly live in their own homes. It seems, in retrospect, that the\nFaceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home, still secretly\nlives in your home, and has never stopped vandalizing your home in\nprotest of these arrests of innocent women.\n\n These faceless\nold women are now filing a civil suit against the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret\nPolice for unfair profiling practices against elderly women who\nhappen to have no faces.\n\n And the Sheriff\njust issued the following public apology:\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNon-specifically,\nmy bad!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sheriff from his hover office in the clouds.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIn general,\nreally sorry about all kinds of things. We\xe2\x80\x99re cool now, right?\xe2\x80\x9d the\nSheriff added before dissipating into tiny crystalline droplets,\nwhich fell gently, a silver moment to the hardened earth below.\n\n Maybe I did speak\ntoo soon about being happy to be back home.\n\n Oh. While I was\nreporting the weather, I received this voicemail from Carlos:\n\n Carlos:\nHi, babe! I heard you were apparently off saving the mayor again just\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I missed you.\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6I wanted to\nask\xe2\x80\xa6eh\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I was so afraid to ask while you were here because I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to complicate our peaceful vacation with difficult\nchoices, but\xe2\x80\xa6uh, here goes.\n\n Cecil, remember\nthat building? The simple rectangular building with the tall, pointed\ntop and covered \xc2\xa0entirely in a tarp? You asked several times what\nthat tarp was covering and I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say\xe2\x80\xa6yet.\n\n And you remember\nthe familiar-seeming man searing dark sunglasses with what looked\nlike blood stains on his shirt but I assured you was just barbecue\nsauce?\n\n Well, he built\nthat building under the tarp! Cecil, it\xe2\x80\x99s a radio station! Kevin\nbuilt a radio station! He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be planning anything evil.\nIn fact, he seems pretty relaxed and friendly these days! He built it\nfor anyone who wants to broadcast or listen to broadcasts.\n\n And,\nit got me thinking, and I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I mean\xe2\x80\x93 you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\ndecide now. And\xe2\x80\x93\nand\xe2\x80\x93 you don't\xe2\x80\x93 you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to decide yes\nat all, but\xe2\x80\xa6but\xe2\x80\x93 but\xe2\x80\x93 but\xe2\x80\x93 but would you ever think\nabout\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x93 would you\xe2\x80\x93 would you ever consider\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Ugh!\n\n This is tough to\nask on voicemail.\n\n Just call me,\nokay? Call me when you\xe2\x80\x99re off the air. I love you.\n\n Cecil:\nYes. Yes, I would, Carlos. I think I really would.\n\n It was so serene\nthere. So lovely.\n\n Okay.\n\n Private thoughts\ndone, uh, let\xe2\x80\x99s turn my microphone back on now.\n\n Well,\nlisteners, I wonder what Carlos might be trying to ask me? I mean,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s probably nothing, and\xe2\x80\xa6even if it was something,\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would move away or anything. Hehe\xe2\x80\xa6move away? No one\nsaid anything about moving away! Who moves away?\n\n I have to stick\naround a bit, anyway, because my sister and brother-in-law are going\nout of town for a couple of weeks and need me to look after my niece\nJanice. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disappoint Janice! I mean, how could I\ndisappoint Janice? By moving away?\n\n Why do you keep\nsaying that? Who\xe2\x80\x99s moving away? Not me!\n\n So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure\nto stay very focused on being a good uncle and guardian. Plus,\napparently the mayor needs me around to save her all the time. Hate\nto leave that behind.\n\n Stay tuned next\nfor the sound of folding cardboard and long strips of tape.\n\n And to all of the\nfaceless old women, living secretly or living otherwise: fight the\ngood fight. Just\xe2\x80\xa6leave me out of it. OK?\n\n Yeah, these\ncotton balls are already soaked.\n\n And, to everyone\nelse:\n\n Goodnight, Night\nVale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\nof the dark. Be afraid of all of the terrible things that are hiding\nthere, and the terrible things they will do."
