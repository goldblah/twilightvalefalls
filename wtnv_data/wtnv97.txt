Episode 81 - After 3327
b'To err is human. But to err is also\ncomputer. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find another test to reveal which of us are\nsecretly bots.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s start things off with the\nCommunity Calendar.\n\n This afternoon, the Museum of\nForbidden Technologies will be hosting a lecture by Night Vale High\xe2\x80\x99s\nA.P. auto shop teacher, Nick Teller. He will be demonstrating some\nfun devices he came up with while tinkering around in his garage. As\nusual for talks at the museum, Nick will be covered with a burlap\ntarp, and a white noise machine will be played through a\nstate-of-the-art surround sound system, so that no dangerous and\nsecret technology can accidentally be learned about.\n\n Tuesday will be the annual day in\nwhich we leave offerings of fruit and Rolaids for the Eternal Scouts\non display in front of City Hall. These brave children rose through\nthe ranks from Boy Scout, to Eagle Scout, Blood Pact Scout, Weird\nScout, Dreadnought Scout, Dark Scout, and Fear Scout, before finally\nachieving the rank of Eternal Scout.\n\n Now, these two brave boys, Frank and\nBarty, stand in their glass cases, as they have for almost three\nyears, with wide unseeing eyes, wide unseeing mouths, and long\nunseeing hair.\n\n It is rumored that one day, in Night\nVale\xe2\x80\x99s hour of greatest need, the Eternal Scouts will awake and walk\namong us once again. Until then, we all bow our heads in silent\nreverence so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to look at them because they are very\ncreepy. We all look at the ground instead, because the ground it not\ncreepy, except that it consumes your body when your body no longer\nbelongs to you.\n\n Wednesday\nis \xe2\x80\x9cTake Your Daughter to Work Day.\xe2\x80\x9d Wednesday is \xe2\x80\x9cPut Your\nDaughter to Work Day.\xe2\x80\x9d Wednesday is \xe2\x80\x9cTeach Your Daughter How to\nDo Whatever Simple Task It Is You are Paid to Do and Then, Once She\nhas Mastered It, Slip Away and Leave Her as Your Replacement Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n If\nyou do not have a daughter, one will be assigned to you. If you do\nhave a daughter\xe2\x80\xa6are you sure you do?\n\n Thursday\nis a lost cause. Why even bother with Thursday? We all tried and\ntried, and still Thursday is what it is. Let\xe2\x80\x99s all give up hope for\nThursday and just let it do its thing.\n\n Friday\nevening, legendary rock band The Clash and the great Amy Winehouse\nare joining together for a free concert in your imagination.\n\n Saturday,\nthere will be a sale at Dark Owl Records, with everything wildly\nreduced in price. Cheapest of all, said Dark Owl owner Michelle\nNguyen, will be the idea of art, which has been degraded to a point\nwhere it holds no recognizable value.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike, what does art even mean\noutside of the intention to make art?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nguyen in a statement\nshe burned into my lawn this morning. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd does the intention to\nmake art alone define what it is? Anyway, you can take art for all I\ncare. I moved on to the intricate fractal happenstance of nature,\nlike, years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe concluded.\n\n If\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s any particular album you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for, please do ask for it\nby name so that Michelle can know the album is too well-known now,\nand she can put every copy she owns in the garbage, with all the rest\nof the popular music.\n\n Sunday\nis someone else\xe2\x80\x99s problem. What, you have to worry about every\nday yourself?\n\n This\nhas been the Community Calendar.\n\n My\nformer intern Maureen has dropped by the studio, and oh my God! She\nhas the most adorable\nbeagle puppy with her! Look at you! Look at yooouuu!\n\n Maureen:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here too.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, of course! Hello, Maureen, you are also here. Yes.\n\n Maureen:\nHi. Whatever. I guess hi.\n\n Cecil:\nMaureen, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a delight to have you and your little buddy here!\n\n Maureen:\nYeah. I\xe2\x80\x93 I bet it\xe2\x80\x99s a delight.\n\n Cecil:\nOkay. What\xe2\x80\x99s been new with you?\n\n Maureen:\nWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Oh, yeah. I had to start a new internship because I\nstill need those credits to graduate. The new internship\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\nsweet, I guess. I, lead an army, or whatever.\n\n Cecil:\nYou lead an army?\n\n Maureen:\nOr whatever! It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to! If you could\nwrite my intern credit letter for school, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this\nother internship. I could just graduate\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nOh, your new internship sounds great! I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re truly applying\nyourself.\n\n Maureen:\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking with another former intern of yours, by the\nway.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, Dana? Oh! So proud of her! My best intern. Ever.\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s really doing some great things for this town. You know she\xe2\x80\x99s\nmayor now, right?\n\n Maureen:\nI know who Mayor Cardinal is! Everything\xe2\x80\x99s about Dana, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nlook at me, I got college credits, and I get to be mayor, not like\nMaureen. Maureen has to lead an army, or whatever, to get those\ncredits.\n\n Cecil:\nAn army?\n\n Maureen:\nOr whatever, it\xe2\x80\x99s not important!\n\n Cecil:\nIt sounds kind of important.\n\n Maureen:\nOh, does it!?! Is that what sounds important? Do you know that there\nare people starving to death somewhere?\n\n Cecil:\nOh my God, where? We should help them!\n\n Maureen:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, somewhere! Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being specific. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually\nsuggesting making the world a better place. Was just using\ntheoretical human suffering as a deflection.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, have you been taking those, uh, Art of Conversation classes at\nthe community college, too? Our receptionist, Lance, got me into\nthese classes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned so much about how to better talk with\npeople. Uh, techniques like intense, almost-invasive listening, and\nabsolute denial of the reality of truth. And,\nchanging the subject \xe2\x80\x93 your best line of defense.\n\n Maureen:\nCan you write me a credit letter, or not?\n\n Cecil:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. Another good question is, \xe2\x80\x9cWhose a good\nboy? Whose a good boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Maureen:\nThis dog is, obviously! He\xe2\x80\x99s a beagle! Therefore, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good boy!\nThis was a mistake. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to you later, or whatever. More\nwhatever than later.\n\n Cecil:\nBye, buddy! Oh, look at you, such a cute dog! I would do anything for\nthat little face, that tiny adorable face and those floppy\ndumb ears! I would do anything!\n\n Oh\nno, the beagle\xe2\x80\x99s leaving! In the arms of Maureen. Maureen is also\nleaving.\n\n Um,\ngoodbye, Maureen! It was nice of you to drop by and talk about\xe2\x80\xa6oh,\nwhatever it was you were talking about.\n\n Listeners,\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s leaving in the company of that same boy I saw her with a couple\nweeks ago. The one with the baseball cap pulled low over his face? I\ndefinitely recognize him. Where do I know him from?\n\n Nah,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m certain this won\xe2\x80\x99t come up again. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\n\n A\nsmall update on my previous Community Calendar announcement. Things\nhave\xe2\x80\xa6gone off track during A.P. auto shop teacher Nick Teller\xe2\x80\x99s\npresentation on his inventions. It seems that he somehow accidentally\nremoved the unsecured burlap tarp from his body, and turned off the\nswitch on the white noise machine next to him, thus foiling the usual\nsafeguards against learning.\n\n His\ncompletely audible talk covered simple life hacks he\xe2\x80\x99s developed to\nlower your electric bill.\n\n The\nfirst is a way of transmitting energy over great distances. To that\nend, he held up a lit light bulb, not visibly attached to any power\nsource. The power, Nick said, came wirelessly from a coil situated 26\nmiles away in the desert.\n\n His\nother power saving tips included setting your thermostat just a bit\nhigher, improving the insulation in your home, and using a free\nenergy generator he invented that can provide power for an entire\nhousehold indefinitely, on no fuel at all.\n\n The\nWorld Government has made a statement, apologizing for the technical\nerrors that are allowing this speech to be heard, and have released a\nresponse that consists of just the words, \xe2\x80\x9cNuh-uh!\xe2\x80\x9d drawn in red\ncrayon on construction paper.\n\n So,\ntwo interesting sides to consider in this story.\n\n Update\non the trial of the century, as four of the five heads belonging to\nfive-headed dragon Hiram McDaniels are tried for their role in the\nattempted coup against our beloved mayor.\n\n The\nfirst witness of the trial was called to the stand today. It was\nHarrison Kip, Adjunct Professor of Archaeology at the Night Vale\nCommunity College. He was once tricked by Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s heads and their\nco-conspirator, the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your\nHome, into summoning a sand golem that wreaked havoc throughout Night\nVale. We covered all this, of course, in our two-part report last\nyear.\n\n Harrison\nhad been so ashamed of his role in the destruction that he fled into\nthe desert to live the life of a simple hermit, only reaching out to\ncivilization to procure the bare necessities of life. And,\noccasionally, get on Skype to remotely teach classes and hold office\nhours.\n\n Mr.\nKip did his best to describe what had happened. But mainly, all that\nhappened is that he was tricked into raising a sand golem, so his\ntestimony wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that interesting.\n\n The\nonly highlight came when he was asked about his months out in the\ndesert. He indicated that he found the desert mostly peaceful, but\nthat he had recently seen something in the middle of the night that\nhad disturbed him. He seemed very shook up about it, slumping\nforward, and mumbling what was (I believe) the word \xe2\x80\x9cappalling\xe2\x80\x9d\nover and over.\n\n That\npart of his testimony probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything, and probably\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t indicate anything is going to happen. As that famous T.V.\nlawyer, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, always says in her big closing\narguments, \xe2\x80\x9cPast\nperformance is not a predictor of future results.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Nick\nTeller\xe2\x80\x99s speech at the Museum of Forbidden Technologies is\ndisastrously continuing to be heard by attendees. And, even more\ndisastrously, the contents of this speech are being repeated on the\nradio.\n\n He\nmoved on from his energy tips to reminisce a bit about some projects\nof his that didn\xe2\x80\x99t go exactly according to plan.\n\n For\ninstance, he said he once did some work on a boat in Pennsylvania\n[mispronounced], and a\nfew mixed-up calculations meant that instead of the boat becoming\ninvisible, as planned, it jumped through both time and parallel\nuniverses, horribly altering every human on board. [x]\n\n But,\nNick went on to emphasize, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t let failures like that get him\ndown, even though that particular failure was so\nspectacular that he had to\nchange his name and fake his death in order to evade the\nconsequences.\n\n Whoo!\nThis is inspiring stuff. Even though hearing it is completely\nillegal\xe2\x80\xa6as is, probably, repeating it on the radio.\n\n Whoopsie!\n\n Well,\nmore from Nick as I continue to \xe2\x80\x9caccidentally\xe2\x80\x9d tell you what he\xe2\x80\x99s\nsaying.\n\n But\nfirst, today\xe2\x80\x99s traffic.\n\n A\nspectrum of gray. The top-most gray is that of sunlight, filtered\nthrough high-altitude clouds. Then, through lower-altitude haze,\ndarkening down on a monochromatic spectrum toward dirt that is\ngray\xe2\x80\xa6or, appears\ngray due to the quality of light.\n\n Built\nup from the dirt are gray buildings, full of gray people speaking\ngrayly.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have another slice of pie,\xe2\x80\x9d they say.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness\nis looking as good as this pie,\xe2\x80\x9d they say.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cPie\ntastes great, and is better, nutritionally, than most people think,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey say.\n\n Colorless,\ntoneless words. Gray faces slacking onto gray necks and gray bodies,\ngray dreams of a gray future that is neither good nor bad, but just\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s next. A gray life, lived grayly. Gray dreams through gray\nnights, electric lights too bright to ever let dark settle into dark,\nno great absence to contrast the stars, no rich black of the void, a\ngray night. Gray dreams. Gray life. Gray words. Gray buildings in a\ngray world and the light grays grayly through the gray.\n\n This\nhas been traffic.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsors:\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nsponsor is Google. Looking for pictures of a monkey riding a pony?\nJust search that on Google and it will probably be there. Looking for\npictures of a dog named Table? Search that, and I bet someone named\ntheir dog Table and took a picture.\n\n How\nabout an image of the exact moment of your death? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, that\nmight be on there too. Give it a search!\n\n The\ninternet is huge. Whatever it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably on there.\n\n Google.\nSearch for super-weird stuff. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably find something at least\nkind of similar.\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsors.\n\n Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s almost time for our weather report, and I have to admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsurprised. I\xe2\x80\x99d have thought, given some of the forbidden information\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been repeating from Nick Teller that we would have been shut\ndown by now. But maybe I was wrong ab\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n wrong\nab\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n wrong\nabout\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n wrong\nab\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n [Electronic rising tone]\n\n \xe2\x80\x93bout\nthat\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n shut\ndown by now\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n wrong\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n wrong\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n wrong\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n wrong\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n wrong\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n g-g-g-g-g-g-gggggggggggggggggggg\n\n [Electronic steady tone]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cTable\nSong\xe2\x80\x9d by Katie Kuffel]\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nfinally back, listeners.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsure you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, over the past several days, that our usual\nbroadcasts had been replaced by harsh buzzing and the occasional\nshout of \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing anything right now, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t sound!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n As I\nhad kind of hoped, the World Government shut down our station. Which\nmeant that I got a couple weeks off.\n\n I\nhad been needing a break, and the extra-legal closure of my place of\nwork, and the forced reeducation of all of us who work there, gave me\njust the chance I needed.\n\n In\nbetween reeducation sessions, I did a number of household chores that\nneeded doing. Painting, gutter cleaning, and the like. The picking\nup, and the putting down, and the mending, and the clearing.\nRe-sodding my lawn after Michelle burned her statement into it. I had\nsome quiet time with Carlos, and I re-watched the entire series of\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer. Uh! I just love at the end of every\nepisode, after she successfully wins the big court case, when she\nsmokes cigars and cracks wise with her law firm partner, Angel. Ugh!\nSo good.\n\n I\nalso dropped in on Nick Teller at his auto shop in the high school.\nHe had just finished up feeding the cars and was grading some papers,\nbut he kindly made time for a chat. I asked him if he wished things\nhad turned out for him differently, if he wished that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had\nto flee his old life and come to this town where his best inventions\nare suppressed by order of the World Government.\n\n He\nsmiled.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I get it. The world has never been accepting of\nwhat I do, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my life here. I like teaching auto\nshop, I like working with young people, I like guiding them into a\nlife of creating new things that will never see the light of day\nbecause they threaten the system as it is and the powers as they are.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s rewarding work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ntold him I was glad that he seemed to have found peace in his life.\nHe said he was, too.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat other choice would I have? It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\ncan go back and fix my mistakes. Or\xe2\x80\xa6wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nturned pensively and told me that he had some old papers he wanted to\nlook through for purely nostalgic\nreasons, and asked if I could leave him to it. And so I did.\n\n Listeners,\nmaybe at some point Nick wanted to be something other than he was,\nbut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he is beholden to that dream he once had. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nokay for him to be all right with who he is now. Acceptance is not\nfailure. Sometimes acceptance is just acceptance.\n\n Of\ncourse, one must always be open to new dreams, and new ambition. And\nif, at some point, Nick decides that he no longer wants to be an A.P.\nauto shop teacher, or if he decides he wants to alter history so he\nwill never have even come here\xe2\x80\xa6then that, too, will be okay.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for an unexpected gain in cabin pressure. No mask will\nhelp you. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for things to go this way.\n\n And\ngoodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: You know what\nwould be great? If someone finally made a movie showing Spider-Man\xe2\x80\x99s\norigin story. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to finally\nsee that on the big screen.'
