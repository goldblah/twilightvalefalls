Episode 32 - Yellow Helicopters
b'A lonely heart, a wandering eye, an empty stomach, a shoulder to cry on. This is what makes us, us.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Sad news, listeners.\n\n\n Old Woman Josie says that the Angels who have been living with her \xe2\x80\x93 helping around the house and ultimately protecting her from all evils \xe2\x80\x93 have disappeared. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say just how sad this news is, for two important reasons:\n\n\n \n Angels are not real, and\n\n\n we are\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0allowed to know about their existence or\xc2\xa0hierarchical\xc2\xa0structure.\n\n\n\n Josie called this weekend and spoke to Vithia, our station intern. She said that the Angels often leave her for a few hours, or days, at a time\xe2\x80\xa6but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been gone for three straight weeks. She thinks that they are off fighting an important war for good, but she\xe2\x80\x99s worried that maybe she just made them mad, or bored.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAngels get bored very easily,\xe2\x80\x9d Josie said. Which is strange, because they are eternal, and there is a lot of down-time during immortality.\n\n\n Vithia told Josie that Angels aren\xe2\x80\x99t real, and that we cannot know such things about them. But this just made Vithia cry, because if you talk about Angels, and you are one who has been secretly chosen by Angels, for special Angelic purposes, you will start crying.\n\n\n Vithia has been sobbing quite a bit this morning, as a matter of fact. I keep asking her, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you OK?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n But she just says, \xe2\x80\x9cAngels aren\xe2\x80\x99t real,\xe2\x80\x9d and then buries her heaving face into her inner elbow and runs off.\n\n\n Dear listeners, it appears the Angels, if they are real (and they are not), have left Night Vale. And none of us are allowed to know this, so\xe2\x80\xa6forget I said anything.\n\n\n The Night Vale Medical Board wants to know, are you heart-healthy? How healthy is your heart? Have you ever checked? Doctors recommend checking your heart at least once a year. Simply separate the skin on your upper chest, and break open the ribs.\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s a tip: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a bone saw handy, just sterilize any old electric saw you might have in your work shed.\n\n\n Right behind your ribs, kind of to the left, is a potato-shaped muscle lump filled with straw and maybe some insects. That\xe2\x80\x99s your heart! Pull that out and sew your chest back up. Wash your heart in warm water, pat dry with a paper towel, and roll flat on a floured surface. Brown both sides in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan, and eat immediately.\n\n\n Remember, a healthy heart is a healthy life!\n\n\n This has been Community Health Tips.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting reports that several Yellow Helicopters have been seen hovering above town. We are all aware of the Black Helicopters (which are World Government), and Blue Helicopters (which are Secret Police), and the Helicopters with Detailed Murals of Diving Birds of Prey (which are the helicopters that took all the children in Night Vale away a few months ago [we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what those helicopters are but\xe2\x80\xa6they did bring all the children back unharmed, and much more well-behaved than before, so they are deemed just as safe as the other helicopters])\xe2\x80\xa6but these new Yellow Helicopters, no one quite knows.\n\n\n They tend to hover in packs of three or more, in fixed locations, for several minutes before moving on. The City Council has said that the helicopters are our guests, and they should be treated as such, but added that the helicopters, more specifically, are uninvited guests, and should be treated with fear, hatred, and uncontrolled panic.\n\n\n If you have any more information on these Yellow Helicopters, keep it to yourself. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question they can hear every move, every sentence, you make. Be quiet and stay inside. They already know.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s go now to sports.\n\n\n After a second straight loss this weekend, Night Vale High School football coach\xc2\xa0Nazr al-Mujaheed expressed some concern over senior quarterback Michael Sandero\xe2\x80\x99s poor play.\n\n\n Last season, the Scorpions won the division title under Sandero\xe2\x80\x99s leadership\xe2\x80\xa6and special powers he had acquired from multiple lightning strikes. One such advantage was the second head he had grown, which helped him see rushing linebackers and get better reads on zone coverage.\n\n\n But in the off-season, Sandero had one of his heads surgically removed, leaving him with only the head that speaks Russian.\n\n\n Angry fans speculate that because Sandero no longer looks like his original self, and because he no longer speaks English nor Spanish, he does not have the same rapport with his teammates.\n\n\n When asked whether or not Sandero was losing the respect of his team, Coach al-Mujaheed said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur boys play together. Our boys play good games. We want to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And here he paused, clearly upset with his star quarterback\xe2\x80\x99s decision to get off-season surgery without consulting team trainers.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to be good football boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\n\n The coach then reached his fingers into his mouth, pulling his tongue slowly out. Slowly, slowly, not stopping. He kept pulling his seemingly-endless tongue out, staring at the reporters the whole time. After he stretched it to about two feet, the last reporter left the room, clearly shaken.\n\n\n The coach remained in his office quietly, and with wide eyes, pulling out his enormous tongue.\n\n\n Larry Leroy, out on the edge of town, says that just this morning he was visited by a Man in a Tan Jacket, who carried a deerskin suitcase. Larry said the man approached his farm and asked about how much sunshine he had been getting.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI told him, John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer? \xe2\x80\x93 his imaginary corn crop had been good this summer, and the sun seemed to be doing just fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Larry said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough some days there\xe2\x80\x99s no sunrise at all, and on other days the sunrise is extremely loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Larry added that this was a pretty strange question \xe2\x80\x93 asking about how much sunshine he\xe2\x80\x99d been getting \xe2\x80\x93 as the sun comes up every day, save those two or three sunless days last week.\n\n\n Larry said he was a nice enough fellow, though, named Emmett. Larry said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly what Everett looked like, nor what his last name was.\n\n\n When asked who Everett was, Larry replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fellow in the Tan Jacket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n When told he just said the man\xe2\x80\x99s name was Emmett, Larry replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Ernest. I said that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bog me down, son!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Then he slapped the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s tape recorder, making the following loud, thumping noise:\n\n\n [loud thumping noise]\n\n\n Larry said that after the man left his home, he saw a dark black line in the sky, coming from the heavens down to near where Old Woman Josie lives, down by the old car lot. He said he thinks it was probably something to do with \xe2\x80\x9cthose weird, tall friends of hers that fly around and make loud trumpet noises and will not stop smiling all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n When asked if he meant Angels, Larry replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bog me down, son!\xe2\x80\x9d and then started weeping.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAngels aren\xe2\x80\x99t real,\xe2\x80\x9d Larry said, through quick breaths and incomprehensible tears.\n\n\n As part of our service to our town, Night Vale Community Radio is taking another moment to allow one of the candidates for mayor to make a brief statement. The following is from Hiram McDaniels:\n\n\nHi, I\xe2\x80\x99m Hiram McDaniels. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of things from my opponent about how the night sky is beautiful but sad, and how sagebrush is a very important smell. You\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard that I am literally a five-headed dragon. All of that is completely correct.\n\n\nBut what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is that I\xe2\x80\x99m literally a five-headed dragon\xe2\x80\xa6who cares.\n\n\nThis is also my campaign slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m literally a five-headed dragon. Who cares!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is that I care about small business owners. What you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is that I care about the future of our children. What you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is that I care about the future of our small children business owners. Have you ever heard the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home say that? No, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. Really, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to hear her say anything at all. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a mouth. I have five mouths.\n\n\nWhat you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\nDo you hear the beating of my terrible wings? Do you feel the flames lick at the corners of a life you once thought belonged to you?\n\n\nSorry about that, my green head got excited. We all have human foibles. I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99m literally a five-headed dragon.\n\n\nWhat you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is my new plan for an expanded parks system, and more youth sports programs.\n\n\nAND YOU WILL NEVER HEAR IT! IT\xe2\x80\x99S A SECRET! AND BURIED IN A SECRET PLACE!\n\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good point, purple head!\n\n\nSo vote for me, Hiram McDaniels. The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home is all about politics as usual. Also, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a mouth, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6weird.\n\n\nA stillness touches the most frantic heart as we all look up in awe and terror! A sudden shout of fire, and all is forgiven. A gentle touch of flame, and all is as if it never was.\n\n\nHiram McDaniels. Whatever you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard, can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\n\n\n Listeners, we\xe2\x80\x99ve received word from Old Woman Josie that half a dozen Yellow Helicopters are circling her home at this moment. She also said that she\xe2\x80\x99s receiving no sunlight. She says all of her clocks tell her it\xe2\x80\x99s the middle of the day, but that she is receiving no sunlight.\n\n\n And, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at our own station clocks, including the wristwatch Carlos gave me for our one-month anniversary, the watch he said is the one true timepiece in all of Night Vale, and it is indeed the middle of the day. I have only been on the air a few minutes, and before I arrived in this studio, the sun was definitely out \xe2\x80\x93 no clouds in the sky,\n\n\n Josie also told us that she used her old opera glasses to look more closely at the helicopters.\n\n\n Just an aside for our younger listeners, Josie was the Chairwoman of the Night Vale Opera for many years, until it folded in the early 1990s when a massive puppy infestation destroyed the theater\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\n\n\n Josie said each helicopter has a large triangular logo with an orange \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d in the middle. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means, but she thinks the darkness enveloping her home is the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 last act to try to protect her. Wherever they have gone, they have left behind a protective shade, keeping out the helicopters and all other dark forces.\n\n\n I reminded her that Angels aren\xe2\x80\x99t real, and she said \xe2\x80\x93 as if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even interrupted \xe2\x80\x93 that if she falls, so does this town.\n\n\n There was a long pause, and then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe never go bowling anymore, Cecil, why is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a tiny underground army living under the bowling alley, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve declared war on all of us\xe2\x80\xa6they injured my new boyfriend \xe2\x80\x93 also, I have a new boyfriend. Listen, we should totally get the team back together and go to League Night again, just like old times.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI would like that, Cecil,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\n But then her voice slowed, turning cold, as if we were strangers with wrong numbers.\xc2\xa0'
