Episode 84 - Past Time
b"Dress for success. Put on your tall\nhat and rubber gloves and long gray coat. Success requires this\nspecific outfit.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s spring again, which apparently\nmeans it\xe2\x80\x99s baseball season.\n\n My brother-in-law Steve\xe2\x80\xa6[Cecil\ntakes a deep breath and lets out an exasperated sigh]\xe2\x80\xa6Steve and\nI took his stepdaughter Janice for Little League baseball tryouts\nthis weekend. Steve and Janice play catch a lot together. She really\nloves the sport. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty adorable.\n\n She shouts things like, \xe2\x80\x9cGo\nfarther, Steve, I wanna see how far I can throw the ball!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And I\nshout things like, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep going, Steve! See how far away you can\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\ntryouts were at the haunted baseball diamond over near the Shambling\nOrphan housing development. There were a lot of kids there. Say what\nyou will about all the people from Desert Bluffs moving to Night Vale\n(and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many things), but it\xe2\x80\x99s created enormous\ngrowth in youth sports. There are leagues for kids with all kinds of\ninterests and abilities.\n\n Janice\ntried out for a wheelchair softball league, the first of its kind in\nNight Vale.\n\n Plus,\nI got to spend time talking to Little League baseball coaches Betty\nLucero and Lucia Tereschenko. Lucia is a fascinating woman, so\ndespite having to be around Steve all day, I had a pretty good time.\n\n More\non that in a bit. But first, the news.\n\n In a\nstudy released today, the Greater Night Vale Medical Community has\nfound a statistical link between a high-carbohydrate diet and the\nnumber of squirrels on your lawn.\n\n According\nto the study, they found that people who take in a higher than normal\nnumber of carbohydrates have an average of 4.74 squirrels somewhere\non their lawn, but those with lower carb intake have a slightly\ndifferent number of squirrels.\n\n A\nrepresentative from the Greater Night Vale Medical Community said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see from this pie chart,\xe2\x80\x9d and here the representative\npointed at an American flag, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the data shows a statistical\nlink between these things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Another\nrepresentative, who was previously unnoticed, then emerged from\nbehind the first representative and stated, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that\nyou adjust your carbohydrate intake and/or your trust/distrust of\nsquirrels accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nfirst representative then did a set of 12 push-ups, the kind where\nyou clap your hands between each one.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve\nus. We\xe2\x80\x99re doctors,\xe2\x80\x9d a third\nrepresentative said as she lowered herself down head-first from the\nceiling at the back of the room. As everyone turned to see her, she\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cJust kidding!\xe2\x80\x9d and then the three representatives began\njuggling and doing yo-yo tricks to hip hop music.\n\n And\nnow it\xe2\x80\x99s time for another edition of \xe2\x80\x9cHey there, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey\nthere, Cecil! I just moved into a new apartment, and after two\nmonths, my landlord is telling me I\xe2\x80\x99m behind on rent. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\npaying my rent. On the last day of each month, I carry a 20-stone bag\nof quartz chips and two pheasant carcasses, and lay them outside his\noffice. What am I doing wrong?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAlso,\nwhat is the currency\nthese days?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSigned,\nIn Debt in Old Town.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hey\nthere, In Debt!\n\n Well,\nI think you\xe2\x80\x99re in the wrong here. Quartz and dead pheasants are not\ncurrency. They have not been legal tender since the 1990s. So, you\nare in arrears on your rent. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would do:\n\n Write\na nice note to your landlord explaining you didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how\nmoney works. Then, maybe find a different job, where they pay you in\nactual American currency \xe2\x80\x93 which has no physical form, and is just\na series of arbitrary numbers printed on ATM receipts. Hope this\nhelps.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey\nthere, Cecil! I love dogs a lot.\nThe other day, I saw a young couple out walking the cutest little\nbeagle puppy. I asked if I could pet him, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\nbut the dog had the sweetest expression, so I pet the dog.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe\ncouple didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak or move. She just glared at me. The boy was\nsmiling. And as the dog licked my hand I asked the boy, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s your\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99 and the boy laughed. It was a cruel, hollow laugh.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nI pet the dog once more and they left, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get that dog out\nof my head. I\xe2\x80\x99m dreaming\nabout it now. Terrible dreams! Terrible dreams where I cannot move. I\nwake physically incapacitated and crying. When I can finally move I\nrun to the bathroom needing to vomit, but unable. I am covered in\ncold, cold sweat but my face is on fire! I hunch over the sink,\nspitting up small globs of black tar, every single night.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nmy question is, should I get a dog? And if so, is a beagle a good\nbreed?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSigned,\nDog Lover in Downtown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hey\nthere, Dog Lover! You should absolutely\nget a dog! You sound allergic to beagles, so maybe a Basset instead.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey\nthere, Cecil! What are you doing Saturday night at, say, 8 pm? Would\nyou be interested in an opera and drinks after?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSigned,\nLonely Boy in the Laboratory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Hey\nthere, Lonely Boy! Yes! I would very much\nlike an opera, and\xe2\x80\xa6whatever else after.\n\n And\nnow, back to the tryouts.\n\n Coach\nLucia Tereschenko told me she\xe2\x80\x99d been seeing more and more of\nthose\xe2\x80\xa6strangers\nlately. And she does not like them.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nstand and stare at the kids. At the coaches, at the parents, just\nbreathing. Not moving, or speaking. Them, I do not like, \xe2\x80\x9c Lucia\nsaid.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAt\nfirst I thought they were from this Desert Bluffs, so many of those\npeople coming to Night Vale, but Desert Bluffs families play in the\nbaseball league now. I meet them, they are nice people. They are good\npeople. They do not stand and stare and breathe,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucia said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThese\nstrangers\xe2\x80\xa6they are from someplace else. Not here, not Desert\nBluffs, They are not humans! They are not even ghosts. Believe me, I\nshould know,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucia said, and then laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cGet it? Because I am\ndead?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ntold Lucia I got it, but she continued.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\ndead, Cecil! Is funny!\nLaugh, okay? I am a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n And\nso I laughed. It was\ngenuinely funny.\n\n But\nthen she went suddenly solemn.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nthese strangers. They remind me of those terrible men on the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\nasked Lucia, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nmen on the train?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n But\njust then an errantly thrown baseball bounced to a stop at Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s\nfeet. She bent over to pick it up but \xe2\x80\x93 being a ghost \xe2\x80\x93 her hands\nwent right through it.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cAch!\nCecil, some days I can pick up the ball, some days I cannot. Can you\nhelp?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\npicked up the baseball and threw it back to the child, who nearly\nfell over running, but caught it nonetheless. And Lucia said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nstill have a good arm, Cecil! You were a great shortstop.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ntold her I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember playing baseball, and she laughed and said\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know what they say about growing old. Memory is the\nsecond thing to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the first?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cRelevance,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cRelevance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Listeners,\nsorry I have to interrupt my story. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting another call from\nHiram McDaniel, literal five-headed dragon and former mayoral\ncandidate. Hiram is in the jailhouse for \xc2\xa0attempting to kill our\ncurrent mayor, and he\xe2\x80\x99s on our phones now.\n\n Hiram?\nHello?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nCecil? It\xe2\x80\x93 It\xe2\x80\x99s me, Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head.\n\n Cecil:\nHello, Violet! Listeners, it was Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head who courageously\nturned in his other four heads for their crimes against the mayor.\nViolet, how are you?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nThey cut a hole in the cell where our main body and our other four\nheads are! My head is poking out of the hole and into the fresh air!\nTechnically, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in jail, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not free! I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nmade a mistake.\n\n Cecil:\nYou did the right thing, Violet. Your other four heads wanted to kill\nthe mayor.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nThere are five of us, but there is one of us.\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I follow.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nDo I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself! I am\nlarge. I contain multitudes!\n\n Cecil:\nAh, ha-ha! My favorite line from Die\nHard!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nCecil, I\xe2\x80\x99ve removed myself as a witness for the prosecution. I stand\nwith my other heads. I\xe2\x80\x93 I stand with and for myself!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head:\nAnd it sure is nice to have you back, Purp\xe2\x80\x93 sorry, you are not\npurple, you are Violet. I respect that.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s violet head:\nThanks, gold head!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gray head:\nInjustice makes me sad.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do our best, Gray. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do our best.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green head:\nWE WILL BURN THE\nCOURTHOUSE! WE WILL DEVOUR THE JUDGE! WE WILL CRUSH THE JURY WITH OUR\nTAIL!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s blue head:\nThey are shackling and muzzling us for our own trial, Cecil! They\nthink our green head is serious\nin his threats!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green head:\nMY THREATS ARE ONLY\nMETAPHORS, YOU SOFT SENTIENT POUCHES OF FUTURE FOOD!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head:\nCecil, I\xe2\x80\x93 I cannot be separated from myself. I\xe2\x80\x93 I may disagree\nwith myself, but I am in this all together!\n\n Cecil:\nViolet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head:\nBut listen, Cecil. If Night Vale knew the trouble they were in,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d let us out so we could help fight these strangers.\n\n Cecil:\nOh, believe me, Hiram, the new sheriff is working double-time to get\nrid of the Desert Bluffs\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngold head:\nNot Desert Bluffs people, Cecil. They\xe2\x80\x99re harmless hard-working folks.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the strangers,\nthe ones that don\xe2\x80\x99t move. The ones that breathe. You tell your mayor\nfriend I can stop 'em.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngray head:\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re not strong enough.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nblue head:\nThey would be quite resistant to our fire, and even our strength.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\ngreen head:\nWE WILL TEAR THE\nSTRANGERS TO PINK, FLESHY SHREDS, AND THEN CHEW THEM! AND THEN\nSWALLOW THEM! I AM BEING LITERAL!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: I will fight with\nyou, Green! Y\xe2\x80\x93 you too, Gold and Gray and Blue! We can do this. We\ncan do this! But\xe2\x80\x93 but\xe2\x80\x93 but\xe2\x80\x93 but Cecil, we need out of this\nprison.\n\n Cecil:\nUh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\ncan do about that, Hiram.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll think of\nsomethin\xe2\x80\x99. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna make it through this. Thanks, buddy!\n\n Cecil:\nWell, then.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a word from our sponsor.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nshow is brought to you by the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty.\nSuper-real beauty. Beauty so real you won\xe2\x80\x99t even recognize it as your\nown.\n\n Like\na set of human lungs, on a white table. So real, so\nbeautiful. Most people have lungs, expanding, contracting, attached\nto nothing. Just lungs. On a white table.\n\n Most\nbeauty products won\xe2\x80\x99t show you what a set of human lungs look like,\nbecause they think you can\xe2\x80\x99t handle real beauty. They will photoshop\nout the models\xe2\x80\x99 lungs, leaving a gaping gory hole in their chests.\nBut an empty upper-rib cavity is not\nwhat a real person looks like. No. We look like this. A pair of lungs\nbreathing autonomously on a white table in a white room with music\nplaying. Inspirational\nmusic. Mostly choir and keyboards, you know the drill. Don\xe2\x80\x99t gotta\ntell you about\ninspirational music, am I right?\n\n Dove.\nLungs on a white table.\n\n Little\nLeague coach Lucia Tereschenko told me the incredible story of her\njourney to Night Vale.\n\n When\nshe was a young woman, she left her home to travel west across\nAmerica. She wanted to find a new life for herself, out of the\ncrowded smoke-choked cities. She walked for miles, picking up work in\nroadside towns. She rode in carriages when she had money, and she\neventually found a job making belts for an old tanner who worked\nLucia long hours for little pay.\n\n The\nold tanner was otherwise kind, and treated Lucia like her very own\ndaughter, because she never had a family. But the tanner grew ill,\nand Lucia took care of her, bathing her and fetching herb mixtures\nfrom the apothecary.\n\n One\nmorning the old woman was no more. Lucia ran her business for a while\nlonger, but since the tanner had no heirs, and Lucia did not feel she\nhad found her true home, she continued west, where there was\nsupposedly golden sunshine along an azure sea.\n\n Soon,\nhowever, she once again was in desperate need of money so that she\ncould eat, and could sleep in safety. She met some men. Silent men.\nMen who kept their faces in shadows, who kept their voices in\nshadows, who kept their guns in shadows. And she worked for them,\nnever knowing what her job was \xe2\x80\x93 just that she was to ride the\ntrain with them until the time was right.\n\n One\nafternoon, the men stood up simultaneously and moved in different\ndirections: one to the front of the train, one to the rear. One\nclimbed through the ceiling onto the roof of the car. Two more drew\npistols on the passengers. They told Lucia to keep everyone calm.\n\n The\ntrain whined to a halt, and the men hurriedly unloaded crates from\nthe rear car onto a horse-drawn cart. The crates were warm, warmer\nthan the air around them. They smelled sharp and earthy, like freshly\nground cinnamon.\n\n The\napparent sheriff of the little town the stopped in, the town of Night\nVale, a place she\xe2\x80\x99d never heard of, soon arrived. He was wearing a\nwelding mask and a cowboy hat. The sheriff drew his gun on the\nshadowy men but, being out numbered, he was unable to do much to stop\nthem.\n\n So,\nwhile calming the others on the train, Lucia crept behind one of the\nmen. He had a kerchief drawn across is face (not an actual kerchief\ntied in front of his face, but a simulacrum of patterned fabric\nhand-drawn on his face). Using one of her leather belts, Lucia\nwhipped the gun out of his hand and deftly picked it up from the\nground. She fired at the outlaws, felling both.\n\n Outside,\nthe sheriff felled two more.\n\n But,\nas she climbed up the top of the car, she heard a shot from just\nbelow her. And then she was lying on her back. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember\nwhy she had laid down. She saw, in the sky just above her, a dark\nplanet of awesome size, lit by no sun. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how she had\nnot noticed it before. It was so close.\nAn invisible titan, all thick black forests and jagged mountains and\ndeep turbulent oceans.\n\n And\nthen\xe2\x80\xa6well, let me take you first to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThe\nRiver, The Woods\xe2\x80\x9d by Astronautalis]\n\n I\nasked Lucia if that\xe2\x80\x99s how she died.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\none moment I\xe2\x80\x99m in a gunfight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand the next moment I\xe2\x80\x99m\na ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\nasked if I had a cigarette. I don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke, so I sad no.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMeh,\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold it anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\nare you living in a baseball diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked her.\n\n She\nsaid this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always a baseball diamond, it was just a field. A\nfield where train tracks used to run. A field where a train once\nrolled to a stop.\n\n But,\nright around this time the game of baseball was becoming popular, and\nkids began coming to the filed to play. Lucia watched, and learned,\nand grew to love the sport\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity and structured grace.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\na beautiful game, Cecil! So I started trying to coach the kids, but\nsince I\xe2\x80\x99m translucent and hazy, they got scared and ran away, calling\nthis the 'haunted baseball diamond.\xe2\x80\x99 Over time, the kids realized I\nhad some helpful things to say about batting stances, and hitting the\ncutoff man, so they came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Lucia\nturned to one of the kids. \xe2\x80\x9cEye on the ball, Manny!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted.\n\n I\nasked Lucia, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you think those men on the train were related to\nthese strangers in Night Vale now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\ndo not see evil like that very often,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no. Those\nmen on the train performed their evil because they needed whatever\nwas in those crates more than they needed life, or peace,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThese strangers? They don\xe2\x80\x99t need\nanything. They are evil, for evil\xe2\x80\x99s own sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\nlooked over and saw Steve and Janice coming my way. They were high\nfiving and grinning.\n\n Lucia\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a good kid, good arm. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a great\nshortstop like her uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ntold Lucia I hope we have a good baseball season, and it was\nwonderful catching up with her. Steve, Janice, and I turned to walk\nback to Steve\xe2\x80\x99s van.\n\n Lucia\nwhispered to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re past time for hope, Cecil. They\xe2\x80\x99re no\nlonger coming. They\xe2\x80\x99re here.\nAnd we cannot stop something that wants nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Staring\nstraight at Janice, ignoring Lucia, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou made the team!\nCongrats! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get ice cream!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Behind\nus, I heard a distant bark. It was a sweet, sickening yelp. And in\nthe reflection on the van window, I could see a boy in a hoodie,\nholding a beagle puppy, and both of them were looking at us.\n\n I\nfelt cold sweat, but my face was hot. My tongue was sticky and thick.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSteve,\ncan we get a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d Janice said, all strapped in.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\nget that ice cream, okay?\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\n\n The\ndog barked again, and I did not look. I did not look at anything as I\ngot in my seat and shut the door. I felt like throwing up.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThanks\nfor driving, Steve,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, putting my hand softly on his arm.\n\n He\nlooked momentarily amused. No, not amused. Concerned. And we drove\naway as Janice told us all about her new team.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for something lurking just outside your window. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\nworry, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a human.\n\n And\nas always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Dance like the government is watching."
