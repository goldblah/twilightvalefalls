Episode 23 - Eternal Scouts
b'We report only the real, the semi-real, and the verifiably unreal.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Here at the station, we have been receiving many calls and emails over the last several months asking us about Khoshekh \xe2\x80\x93 the cat found hovering in the men\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom. Well, he is doing just fine, and thank you very much for your concern. In fact, he recently gave birth to an adorable litter of kittens. How does a he cat give birth? Well, how does a he cat hover in an immobile spot in a radio station bathroom?\n\n\n Some things just aren\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be questioned. Most things, actually.\n\n\n We slipped a note under Station Management\xe2\x80\x99s door, asking if we could keep all those adorable, floating kittens. Management responded with a great thrashing behind the closed door of their office, and a localized rain storm in the break room. We are still working with the station oracle to understand their message, and we will let you know soon what we do with the kittens.\n\n\n Exciting news from the Night Vale chapter of the Boy Scouts. Two of their members \xe2\x80\x93 Franklin Wilson and Barton Donovan \xe2\x80\x93 have achieved all the necessary requirements to advance from the rank of Fear Scout to that final and most terrible of ranks: Eternal Scout. The ceremony will take place at an unspecified time today, in the Hole in the Vacant Lot Out Back of the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, and anyone is invited to attend.\n\n\n Those who wish to view the ceremony should wear loose-fitting clothing and tell everyone they know that they will be going on a long trip \xe2\x80\x93 oh, just somewhere, to clear their heads, you know? And that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they will be back, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for a long time, probably.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI just really have to find myself, and I think the open road is the place to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d you should say. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look for me,\xe2\x80\x9d you should continue, taking hold of your loved one\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and maintaining an intense eye contact. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The City Council voted this week to make death a meritocracy. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all of human existence, death has been a communistic sort of event,\xe2\x80\x9d the Council said in a prepared statement, and that \xe2\x80\x9cwe live in America, where it is not the government\xe2\x80\x99s job to give death to every single citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The Council noted that from now on, death would be earned through hard work and productivity, not just as a handout for every resource-sucking freeloader on the street.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to die,\xe2\x80\x9d the Council said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will have to achieve death yourself. Not everyone gets to die, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The vote won by a small margin, with the opposition split between keeping death universal and others pushing for banning death altogether.\n\n\n Listen, Night Vale, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I am for this new merit-based system of death. If everyone gets to die, then no one will really value death. I used to be young, and idealistic, and think that death was a human right, that everyone deserved to die. But now, I realize that dying is very hard work. I\xe2\x80\x99m working hard every day, trying to die, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear me complaining, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, government, where\xe2\x80\x99s my free death?'
