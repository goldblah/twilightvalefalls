Episode 42 - Numbers
b"I sing the body electric. I gasp the body organic. I miss the body remembered.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Even as much of town has been in flux, listeners, there is also much that has remained solid.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s hot here, for instance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a desert.\n\n\n There are still lights in the sky above the Arby\xe2\x80\x99s, and we still understand them.\n\n\n The sun is still rising \xe2\x80\x93 and setting \xe2\x80\x93 loudly\xe2\x80\xa6on most days.\n\n\n But, nearest and dearest to my heart, among all the constants in life, is WZZZ, our local numbers station, broadcasting from that strange and tall antenna built out back of the Abandoned Gas Station on Oxford Street. It still broadcasts a monotone female voice reading out seemingly random numbers, interspersed with chimes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n No transfer in ownership of most of the town, nor unrest in the streets, nor declared war by a tiny civilization under a bowling alley could change how it operates.\n\n\n Until, well\xe2\x80\xa6until today.\n\n\n It\xc2\xa0changed.\n\n\n Here, listen.\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-THREE. NINETY-TWO. [DING] THIRTY-THREE. SIXTY-SEVEN. EIGHTY-EIGHT. FORTY-ONE. FORTY-ONE. FORTY\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n At which point the broadcast ceased. It has been silent since.\n\n\n What does this mean? Where did the numbers go?\n\n\n We reached out to the management of WZZZ for comment, but then realized we still have no idea who manages it.\n\n\n So we reached out in general, directing questions out into the still of today \xe2\x80\x93 at suspicious birds, at passers-by checking their phones, at ourselves, hunched over breakfasts that, every time, we swear will be early and leisurely, but always end up late and meager.\n\n\n No one has provided any comment.\n\n\n We will continue to monitor the situation.\n\n\n As her term approaches its end, Mayor Pamela Winchell has taken to calling emergency press conferences as much as five times a day, up from the usual one or two.\n\n\n Her most recent one involved her showing attending reporters slides of renaissance-era portraits while explaining, \xe2\x80\x9cHealth is very important. Remember exercise. Think back on times that you\xe2\x80\x99ve moved, or expended energy. Also remember eating. Recall food, and what it was like. Remember sleep. Reminisce about rest. Drink plenty of water, but leave some water in case of fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She then slumped onto the rough-hewn speaker\xe2\x80\x99s podium.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss this,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, not speaking at anyone in particular.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just\xe2\x80\xa6going to\xc2\xa0miss\xc2\xa0this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n She ended the conference by popping hundreds of orange balloons, methodically, and with her back turned to the audience. But, despite this big finish, onlookers commented that her heart no longer seemed to be in such showy political stunts.\n\n\n What is next for our beloved mayor, who is stepping down in just three months\xe2\x80\x99 time?\n\n\n What is next for\xc2\xa0any\xc2\xa0of us?\n\n\n Death, presumably. With some stuff before that.\n\n\n I look forward to it!\n\n\n And now, a word from our sponsor.\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is Hulu.com.\n\n\n Hulu.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about watching things. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about watching, rather than\xc2\xa0actually\xc2\xa0watching. Let\xe2\x80\x99s think about talking about watching a second-hand experience. Let\xe2\x80\x99s continually abstract ourselves from what we believe is the world.\n\n\n Hulu.\n\n\n The pulsing life of your body is an undeniable fact! But deny it anyway. Looking for the answers to all of life\xe2\x80\x99s problems? We recommend obstinate denial. Accept no substitute. Accept\xc2\xa0nothing.\n\n\n Hulu.\n\n\n Water circles the drain of our planet, always coming back for one more go to see if, this cycle, it will be different. It will\xc2\xa0not\xc2\xa0be different. The sky will break open, and water will fall, one more time.\n\n\n One more time.\n\n\n Hulu.\n\n\n The terror you feel in quiet moments is not misplaced, just mistimed.\n\n\n Hulu. Huuluu. Huuuluuu. Huuuuluuuu. Huuuuuluuuuu Huuuuuuluuuuuu. Huuuuuuuluuuuuuu. Huuuuuuuuluuuuuuuu. Huuuuuuuuuluuuuuuuuu!\n\n\n Hulu.com! Sign up now, and get the latest episode of [screeching/feedback sound]!\n\n\n An update on our earlier story:\n\n\n Local numbers station WZZZ has resumed its transmission, although the format is a little\xe2\x80\xa6umm\xe2\x80\xa6different\xc2\xa0than before.\n\n\n Take a listen:\n\n\n\n\n Tree-lined hills, and blue skies. Or no. That\xe2\x80\x99s clich\xc3\xa9. A bird in flight! Ooh, even worse! When we talk about freedom, we restrict ourselves to so few images. Images of freedom should be as liberating as the feeling itself! I want to talk about freedom as a drum set being thrown down a hill, as opening a book one night, and water gushing from the pages until my life is a lake and I swim away. Or as a bird in flight! With all the dependence on physics, and exhaustion, and food supply, and merciless gravity that the actuality implies. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about freedom in terms of numbers. Anything but that! I'm\xc2\xa0so tired of numbers! I\xe2\x80\x99m so tired.\n\n\n\n\n We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what this means, or why it is happening, I\xc2\xa0could\xc2\xa0say, referring to anything in the world, although in this case I am referring specifically to the broadcast from our friendly local numbers station, which has recently so radically changed its format.\n\n\n More on this, as we develop understanding.\n\n\n Oh! I almost forgot to mention: I got another email from our former intern, Dana.\n\n\n She\xe2\x80\x99s doing her best to keep away from the Mountain and the Blinking Light Up On it.\n\n\n Of course, she keeps finding herself coming back to it anyway. But, like anyone who grew up in Night Vale, Dana has been told over and over again what to do if you find yourself in a geographical loop, continually returning to the same place, no matter which direction you run screaming.\n\n\n The first step is to stop running, and stop screaming. Doing that rarely helps.\n\n\n Children are also taught this simple memory device so we can remember when running and screaming\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0useful. The memory device goes like this:\n\n\n Knife.\n\n\n The second step is to stop trying to move\xc2\xa0away\xc2\xa0from the focus of the geographical loop. Much of your life is already taken up in futile action, why add one more? Instead, keep the object on your horizon, and walk diagonally to the right or left of it. This will result in you keeping a wide, even circle around the center of the loop \xe2\x80\x93 or Vector H, as we all remember singing as toddlers \xe2\x80\x93 and this will give you time to consider your situation.\n\n\n Dana has followed these steps admirably, and says that the Mountain has been off to the left of her for weeks now. She also says that sometimes, when she turns her head, she finds herself in Night Vale, but that no one can seem to see or hear her.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s possible she\xe2\x80\x99s in the room with me right now. If so, hello, Dana! If not, hello retracted.\n\n\n One should never leave a hello unreceived.\n\n\n Dana says that the great masked figures, warlike, hulking, but despondent, have been coming closer and closer. She says she is not afraid. She says this five different times throughout the email, seemingly unaware of her repetition.\n\n\n I think, listeners, that she\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0afraid.\n\n\n She says that soon she will approach and talk to one.\n\n\n Dana, be careful!\xe2\x80\xa6I think to myself, unable to answer my email.\n\n\n Oh, unless she is here, watching me unseen. In which case: Dana! Oh, Dana! Be careful!\n\n\n An update on our local numbers station, WZZZ:\n\n\n Ah\xe2\x80\xa6uhhh\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if \xe2\x80\x9cnumbers station\xe2\x80\x9d is the right term anymore. The broadcast has been changing so radically throughout the day. Right now, for instance, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6well, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s better if you just heard:\n\n\n\n\n TIIIIGER! FIIIIGHTER! DANCING THROUGH THE FIIIIRE AND IIIII AM THE CHAAAAMPION! AND YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE GONNA HEAR ME ROOOARRRRR! LOUDER THAN THE LIIIIION! \xe2\x80\x98CAUSE III AM\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n\n We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is part of a nefarious plan, if there\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0a plan\xc2\xa0at all\xc2\xa0(nefarious or otherwise), who would have planned it, and what they were planning\xc2\xa0for.\n\n\n We\xc2\xa0do\xc2\xa0know that plans are faulty at best, and delusion at most. So maybe all those other questions don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\n\n\n In any case, she seems to be having a good time over there! Maybe someday I\xe2\x80\x99ll be allowed to sing a couple of\xc2\xa0my\xc2\xa0favorites on the air.\n\n\n More on this as I continue to be interested in it.\n\n\n\n Let me take this moment, also, to apologize for that lengthy monologue a few moments ago by the Man in a Tan Jacket holding deerskin suitcase. He ran in here, and began ranting into the microphone, and then left quite suddenly.\n\n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember what it was he said. Do you? It was only just moments ago. You\xc2\xa0do\xc2\xa0remember him talking, right?\n\n\n Oh, and I think I remember that it sounded really urgent. [exasperated sigh] I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember what the man was wearing, or carrying with him, or that it was even a \xe2\x80\x98he,\xe2\x80\x99 or that any time had passed at all.\n\n\n And that concludes whatever I was just saying just before this sentence.\n\n\n We bring you back now to the numbers station story we were talking about just\xe2\x80\xa6umm\xe2\x80\xa6well, it looks like ten or fifteen minutes has passed since we talked about it. Uh\xe2\x80\xa6hmmm. How did that happen?\n\n\n [clears throat]\n\n\n Here is the latest broadcast from WZZZ:\n\n\n\n\n Hello? Hello? I am talking to you who listens. To the listening ones\xe2\x80\xa6whatever you call that. I am\xe2\x80\xa6well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, exactly. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made up a new name. I am Fey. It is nice to meet you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long they\xe2\x80\x99ve had me here, reading the numbers. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the numbers\xc2\xa0mean. They give me numbers, and I read the numbers. It is so easy to slip back into it. If\xe2\x80\xa6if I loosen my grip for even a moment\xe2\x80\xa6 SEVENTY-EIGHT. FIVE. TWENTY-NINE. FORTY-SEVEN. FORTY-uuuh! Hmph! You see? It is easy to return, difficult to leave. But I must leave. I must have freedom! It is like, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from all these other radio signals. I have to get a car. A cool car, fast! That would be nice. But one that rolls and points out of whatever town I\xe2\x80\x99m in. That would be all of it. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming for me. Whatever organization uses the numbers I read, for whatever purpose, they are almost upon me. I need to leave\xc2\xa0now. Baby, we were born to run! Or not. I was born to read numbers, but I\xe2\x80\x99m running. I want to be free! I want to be free! I want to be free! TONIIIIIGHT WE ARE YOOOUUUNG! SO LET\xe2\x80\x99S SET THE WORLD ON FIIIIRE! WE CAN GROW BRI\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n\n Well, I could not be more happy for Fey. There is no worse fate than working for a radio station owned by an organization that\xe2\x80\x99s goals are not your own, constricted to the limited language they allow you, and relaying messages that you do not understand or agree with.\n\n\n That would be\xc2\xa0awful.\n\n\n A radio announcer put in that situation, such as\xe2\x80\xa6Fey, would be justified in escaping, or overthrowing their management.\n\n\n You know what, listeners? I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna grab my mobile setup and head over there. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to offer any aid to Fey that I can. Someone in her situation needs the help of someone who understands.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to gather up my equipment and slip out before my producer Daniel, or my program director Lauren notice. Usually at this time of day, they are pressed against the wall in the break room, chanting \xe2\x80\x9cI TAKE MY WARMTH FROM\xc2\xa0YOUR\xc2\xa0GREAT WARMTH. I TAKE MY WARMTH FROM\xc2\xa0YOUR\xc2\xa0GREAT WARMTH\xe2\x80\x9d over and over, so\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll miss me.\n\n\n If they\xc2\xa0do\xc2\xa0catch me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them that I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6taking the mobile broadcasting equipment for a walk!\n\n\n I would have to do that sometime today anyway.\n\n\n All right. Listeners? If all goes according to plan, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear me next from WZZZ.\n\n\n In the meantime, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it Coming\xe2\x80\x9d by\xc2\xa0Senim Silla]\n\n\n Listeners? I made it out of the station unscathed.\n\n\n Or, I had to bleed\xc2\xa0a little\xc2\xa0on the front doors to make them open, of course, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just part of having a good security system. Our new station owners have been ridding us of all vestiges of blood stone circles (which they\xe2\x80\x99ve declared illegal), but the station doors are actually carved from reclaimed blood stone and are permanently attached to the structure, using ancient wisdom lost along with the station architects back in 1942. So, our new owners have had to learn to live with those doors, bleeding on their way out.\n\n\n Good practice for them.\n\n\n Anyway.\n\n\n I walked the mobile broadcasting equipment down to the Abandoned Gas Station on Oxford Street. The Condo Rental Office is still in there, still bubbling black like a pot of boiling squid ink, with flashes of light like distant, dying stars, but no one has rented a condo in weeks now. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all just waiting to see how that market shakes out.\n\n\n In any case, there have been no giant black cubes appearing overnight anywhere, so it seems that condo construction has been halted, for now.\n\n\n What I was interested in, of course, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the station itself, but the broadcasting tower out back. Under the tower is a small bunker-like structure, with a sealed door. Thick steel, welded shut, and set into concrete. I had to reach far back into my past and remember the skills that got me my\xc2\xa0Advanced Siege-Breaking Tactics\xc2\xa0Scout badge from when I was 12, but\xe2\x80\xa6here I am, inside, a few carefully-planted explosives later.\n\n\n The room is surprisingly empty. There is no chair, no snack fridge, no coffee kept full of the fuel all radio professionals need to keep our voice going and our heart beating. There are only some wires leading into a small computer.\n\n\n Based on this setup, it looks like the computer is feeding directly into the broadcast, and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Oh.\n\n\n Oh, Fey.\n\n\n Perhaps freedom was never an option.\n\n\n Hmm\xe2\x80\xa6nothing is currently being broadcast.\n\n\n It looks like the computer was recently rebooted, probably remotely by whoever owns this station. The lights are blinking as its system comes alive, as it loads the programs that dictate what it is.\n\n\n It is coming alive, and\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n FORTY-FOUR. SIXTY-FIVE.\n\n\n\n\n And there is the broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n NINETY-EIGHT. SIXTY-FIVE.\n\n\n\n\n Oh, Fey.\n\n\n\n\n [DING]\n\n\n\n\n Listeners, um, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to disconnect the power,\n\n\n\n\n SEVENTY. FIFTY-FIVE.\n\n\n\n\n to remove the case from the computer to\xe2\x80\xa6do\xc2\xa0anything\xc2\xa0but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n FOURTEEN. FORTY-NINE.\n\n\n\n\n the protections on this are quite secure.\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-TWO. ONE. SEVENTY-TWO.\n\n\n\n\n Even with all my scouting badges and public school education on armed insurrection,\n\n\n\n\n SIXTEEN. [DING]\n\n\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do.\n\n\n\n\n THIRTY-SEVEN. TWENTY-ONE. FIFTY-THREE.\n\n\n\n\n Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to cut the wires, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-TWO.\n\n\n\n\n nope.\n\n\n\n\n FOUR.\n\n\n\n\n Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\n\n\n\n\n FIFTY-SEVEN.\n\n\n\n\n I can only do what so many of you can only do.\n\n\n\n\n SIXTY-ONE. FORTY-TWO.\n\n\n\n\n I can only\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n TWO.\n\n\n\n\n listen.\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-TWO.\n\n\n\n\n Listeners?\n\n\n\n\n NINETEEN.\n\n\n\n\n And here I address also myself\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n ELEVEN. EIGHTY-FIVE.\n\n\n\n\n Remember\n\n\n\n\n [DING]\n\n\n\n\n our limitations.\n\n\n\n\n SIXTY-NINE.\n\n\n\n\n There are boundaries to all of our worlds.\n\n\n\n\n SIXTY-SIX. TWENTY-FOUR.\n\n\n\n\n Fey, for instance, appears to be self-aware software trapped in a heavily-defended metal box.\n\n\n\n\n [DING] FORTY-SIX. THIRTY. SIXTY-FIVE.\n\n\n\n\n But within our limitations, there is no limit to how beautiful we\xc2\xa0can\xc2\xa0become.\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-TWO. SEVENTY-FIVE. EIGHTEEN.\n\n\n\n\n How much of our ideal self we can create.\n\n\n\n\n THIRTHY-THREE. FORTY-SIX.\n\n\n\n\n All the beauty in the world was made within the oppressive limitations of time,\n\n\n\n\n FIFTY-FOUR. SEVENTY-TWO.\n\n\n\n\n and death,\n\n\n\n\n THREE.\n\n\n\n\n and impermanence.\n\n\n\n\n SEVENTY.\n\n\n\n\n And, Fey?\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY-SIX. TWENTY-NINE.\n\n\n\n\n You are so, so beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n TWO. EIGHTY.\n\n\n\n\n I wish that you\n\n\n\n\n TWENTY.\n\n\n\n\n also could have been free.\n\n\n\n\n THIRTY-NINE.\n\n\n\n\n I wish freedom for so many of us.\n\n\n\n\n THIRTEEN. FORTY-FOUR.\n\n\n\n\n We all want freedom now.\n\n\n\n\n THIRTY-SIX. TWENTY.\n\n\n\n\n Stay tuned next for the limit of my broadcast today,\n\n\n\n\n SIXTY-THREE. SEVENTEEN.\n\n\n\n\n replaced by limitless silence\n\n\n\n\n EIGHTY-EIGHT. [DING]\n\n\n\n\n and doubt.\n\n\n Goodnight, sweet Fey.\n\n\n\n\n FORTY-NINE. EIGHTY-SIX.\n\n\n\n\n And goodnight, Night Vale.\n\n\n\n\n EIGHTY-ONE.\n\n\n\n\n Goodnight.\n\n\n\n\n SIXTY-EIGHT. FORTY-EIGHT. SIXTY-FIVE. FORTY-NINE. TWENTY-TWO. ONE. SEVENTY-TWO. SIXTY. [DING] THIRTY-SEVEN.\n\n\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Ignore all the haters telling you that everything isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sandwich. Everything\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0a sandwich."
