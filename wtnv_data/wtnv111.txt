Episode 92 - If He Had Lived
b"Which came first \xe2\x80\x93 the chicken, the\negg, or airplanes?\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Hello, listeners. This week is\nNational Alternate History Week, in which we celebrate our rich\nhistory that could have\nhappened, if what actually\nhappened didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhappen. The Night Vale Historical Society sorts through the local\nsubmissions, and the best story gets placed into the elementary\nschool curriculum. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fun activity that helps boost creativity\nand obfuscate the past.\n\n Today,\nfor my version of history, I will be looking at the Kennedy\nassassination and trying to answer the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat If He Had\nLived?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Well,\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a start.\n\n He\nwould have eaten lunch. Did you know he was on his way to a lunch\nwhen he was killed? He was! He was probably hungry. If he had lived,\nhe would have eaten \xe2\x80\x93 big bites full of gusto.\n\n Later\nthat day he would have gone to Austin. He would have breathed deep,\nhealthy breaths.\n\n He\nprobably would have been reelected if he lived. Sure! Handsome\ncharismatic guy like that? Four more years! No Lyndon Johnson (or\nLyndon Johnson would, as far as I know, continue to exist \xe2\x80\x93 but no\nPresident Johnson).\nWithout the pressure of having to win another term, perhaps he would\nhave pulled us out of Vietnam in \xe2\x80\x9866 or '67, saving countless lives\nand forever altering the cultural and artistic landscapes of the late\n'60s and early '70s. Our art would be different, there would be more\nof us, and he would go on living.\n\n Jackie\nKennedy would feel no grief. She would never have to feel grief\nagain. She would stand, ageless and smiling, on bandstands, on\nstages, waving, her smile distant (not even a smile, but a\nperformance of a\nsmile), waving, on bandstands, on stages, griefless, waving, ageless,\nsmiling.\n\n More\non our story of \xe2\x80\x9cIf He Had Lived\xe2\x80\x9d soon. But first, the news.\n\n I\nknow that some of our listeners were worried about the Beatrix Lowman\nMemorial Meditation zone, that state-of-the-art (and enormously\nexpensive) institution that reopened this Spring. There was concern\nthat the Meditation Zone may have been damaged or even destroyed at\nthe attack by the evil beagle and his army of unmoving strangers that\nnearly erased our town from the map just a couple months ago. But the\ngood news is that the Meditation Zone is entirely undamaged, and it\nis ready for you to meditate in.\n\n What\na tragedy it would have been to lose such an important aspect of our\ncommunity! And also, how frustrating it would have been, given that\nlarge parts of our city government were facing huge budget shortfalls\nwhile more and more city money was heaped on the rebuilding of the\nZone. All of that money for nothing!\n\n But\nno, the Zone still stands! Celebrate by coming on down to the Beatrix\nLowman Memorial Meditation Zone, and hooking yourself up into one of\nthe state-of-the-art meditation machines that will have you calm and\nharvested in no time at all. What a stress reliever!\n\n The\nNational Weather Service has released a statement saying that the\nthunderstorms that have been going continuously for the last several\nmonths to the west of Night Vale might not be thunderstorms, but\ninstead the movements of the terrible court of the Distant Prince.\nThey explained that when warm, moist air enters a low pressure\nsystem, sometimes it does so around the barely-understood (and\nall-powerful) Distant Prince, flanked by his harbingers and served by\nthe court shriekers, the mangled servants, and the hollow-eyed\nweepers \xe2\x80\x93 all of which would result in some lightning, thunder, and\nof course, localized atrocities.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nalso possible that they\xe2\x80\x99re just some particularly persistent\nthunderstorms. Either way, the Weather Service said, \xe2\x80\x9cBest to just\navoid the area entirely. Because being struck by lightning, or being\nskinned alive by the mangled servants, are both real and deadly\nthreats that should be avoided.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nyear is 1973. Kennedy had not died, and is finishing his third term.\nAn embargo in somewhere called the \xe2\x80\x9cMiddle East\xe2\x80\x9d results in\nsoaring gas prices. But the confidence America has for their\npresident is high. He saw us through many other crises \xe2\x80\x93 including\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the Svitz-Franchia Standoff of\n1967, and the rise of the Blood Space War in 1971. We wait in long\nlines at gas stations, but he comes by to each\ngas station \xe2\x80\x93 thousands\nof gas stations at once, multiplying himself as he has learned to do,\nand smiling at us, and we feel at ease. Broke, but at ease.\n\n He\ncontinues as president through the turbulence of the '70s and into\nthe '80s. A biopic is made of his life, starring the mid-level movie\nstar Ronald Reagan (who will soon be washed up and entering his\nlate-life career of narrating commercials for frozen food and\ninsurance). The movie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention Dallas. Nothing happened\nin Dallas, except a short drive to lunch. This is mostly what happens\nin Dallas.\n\n Paul\nSimon releases his classic album Graceland.\nIt is about the time that President Kennedy visited Graceland in\n1982. The album is a huge flop due to its limited subject matter and\naural motif of pained moans and lawnmower engines.\n\n Jackie\nKennedy has not aged. In fact, she appears younger\nthan before. At night, she walks among the monuments in D.C., serene\nand alone, not even a Secret Service escort with her. Anyone who\ntries to approach finds themselves pushed back by a faint mist that\nsmells of apple and spice, and feels like thousands of needles.\nWitnesses claim her feet are not even touching the ground. Her arms\nseem longer than they used to, as though they were the only part of\nher body continuing to change.\n\n If\nJFK had lived, listeners, \xe2\x80\x9cIf He Had Lived.\xe2\x80\x9d More soon. First,\nthis.\n\n Remember\nthe phases of the moon: new, crescent, quarter, gibbous, gelatinous,\nfull, very full, swirling, angry, unsure of itself, mad with power,\ndisappointed in the newest Marvel movie, very very\nfull, feeling like an impostor, jealous toward the sun, being extra\nnice to the sun to make up for the jealousy the sun is unaware of,\ntrying to sabotage the sun\xe2\x80\x99s happiness but only succeeding in\nsabotaging its own happiness, and finally new again.\n\n This\nhas been the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Fun Fact Science Corner.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsors.\n\n Sometimes\nyou are on the precipice, the moment where everything could topple.\nMaybe it is danger, or a hard choice, or just change (which is, in\nour perception, the biggest danger of all). And sometimes we are on\nthe smooth flats, where everything is stable, and the precipice is\njust a tickle in the back of the back of our minds.\n\n But\ndeep down, we know the truth. We see it sometimes, driving at night\nthrough a rainstorm, or when the phone rings at the wrong hour, or\nwhen the plane starts to shake, there are no smooth flats. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\nprecipice. Always.\n\n And\nsometimes we are facing the precipice, and sometimes we are turned\naway. But it is always there, and we are always teetering.\n\n And\nmaybe the fall isn\xe2\x80\x99t even the worst part. Maybe, when we fall, there\nis at least the relief that we know we\xe2\x80\x99re falling. No more\nuncertainty. Maybe the worst part is the teetering, the teetering for\nyears and years.\n\n Delta\nAirlines: It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you\xe2\x80\x99re safe anywhere else.\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsors.\n\n The\nyear is this year. The day is today. The time is now. President\nKennedy calls a press conference. His salt-and-pepper hair is neatly\ncombed, his hands are steady. He has been president for decades. He\nopens the conference by issuing a warm birthday message to cinematic\ntreasure Lee Marvin. Mr. Marvin turns 30 today, and is perhaps the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s most beloved performer.\n\n This\npleasantry aside, the president announced that we have a grave\nnational problem that must be addressed. He then said your\nname several times, and shuddered for five silent minutes. An aide\nshowed some pictures of you, while the president pointed at them\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere we see the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Finally\nhe said your name again, visibly blanched, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cRight?\nRight?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Congress\nwidely agreed with the president\xe2\x80\x99s message, and several bills were\nintroduced with the goal of solving the problem that is you.\n\n Jackie\nKennedy had no comment. Not only had she never felt grief, it seemed\nto her that she had not felt anything at all since that day she had\nlunch in Dallas. It was as though some real human part of herself had\nexperienced something so intense, and sincere, that all feelings had\ndiverged from this false version of herself, leaving her hollow.\n\n It\nhad been an okay lunch.\n\n The\npresident complained of headaches. He was experiencing more and more\nas the years went on.\n\n A\ncontinuation on our story soon.\n\n If,\nhypothetically, angels existed \xe2\x80\x93 which, legally,\nof course, I cannot say that they do \xe2\x80\x93 but it they did, then the\nangels would have let me know that Old Woman Josie fell in her garden\nand broke her hip this week. The hypothetical angels (who are all\nnamed\xe2\x80\xa6oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s say Erika) said that she is fine and in good\nspirits, but will have to spend a few days in the hospital. They are\na little worried about that, since the hospital is a\nbarely-understood and terrible place, where doctors lurk and nurses\nflit from patient to patient.\n\n Rumor\nhas it that on the darkest night of the darkest month, if you stand\nin just the right\nplace, you can see ghost ambulances carrying ghost patients into the\nghost E.R. \xe2\x80\x93 which is the best and most up-to-date ghost E.R. in\nthe region, much better even than the ghost E.R. available over in\nPine Cliff (the town nearby that is entirely populated by ghosts).\n\n Pine\nCliff residents often come to our hospital for treatment, rather than\ngoing to their understaffed and underfunded ghost hospital.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s just not right, them straining our resources and taking\naway medical attention from our own local\nghosts instead of fixing the ghost problems in their own ghost city.\n\n Anyway,\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s wishing a quick recovery to my good friend Old Woman Josie. It\nsounds like a painful slip, but hopefully the sheer desire to escape\na place as baffling and terrifying as a hospital will help her push\nthrough her recovery as soon as possible.\n\n Back\nto \xe2\x80\x9cIf He Had Lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nyear is 2080. Coastal cities all over the world are succumbing to the\nwater that had long sustained them \xe2\x80\x93 the basic elements of each\ncity, like streets and burger shacks, slowly disappearing below the\nsea foam.\n\n The\nEighth Siege of the Great Night Vale Temple rages on. The scion of\nthe Dark Order makes his prophesied appearance at the exact correct\nprophesied time (after several false starts where he had arrived too\nearly and had to leave again).\n\n President\nKennedy offers a steady hand to the nation, even as his beloved\nMassachusetts is swallowed by the rising seas. He brokers a deal with\nthe Sino-Soviet superstate that provides safe passage for the masses\nof climate refugees, and also those fleeing the shrouded armies of\nthe Dark Order. He addresses the country with inspiring words that\npeople will remember for decades afterwards.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nsea levels will not rise another inch. Instead, the American people\nwill rise to meet the sea levels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Everyone\napplauds The sea levels continue to rise. Millions are displaced.\n\n Jackie\nKennedy lies in the White House Rose Garden. She lies there for\nyears. Moss grows on her face. She is trying to remember what really\nhappened. She is trying to\nunderstand what the even means.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthis all really happening now? But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel\nlike it!\xe2\x80\x9d It feels like what was real was left behind long ago, and\nnow even the raindrops on her upturned face are a series of tiny\nlies.\n\n Speaking\nof rain, the finale of our alternate history in a moment.\n\n But\nfirst, the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cOpposite\nHouse\xe2\x80\x9d by Cass\nMcCombs]\n\n We\nbring you now to the final installment of our \xe2\x80\x9cIf He Had Lived\xe2\x80\x9d\nalternate history story.\n\n It\nis the heat death of the universe. Everything that ever was has\nbroken down to the most basic particles, and those particles have\nreached a perfect stasis of temperature. There will never again be\nchange. Without change, there will never again be anything at all.\nThe universe has ended \xe2\x80\x93 not by ceasing to exist, but just by\nfinding perfect balance. An Armageddon of Zen, not fire.\n\n President\nKennedy, never assassinated, floats in the nothing. His hair is\nneatly combed, and he projects an optimistic but vague expression\nthat gives nothing away.\n\n Jackie\nKennedy floats near him. She has never felt grief. Her smile is a\nforged copy of a painting of a smile, many layers removed from the\nemotion it is meant to convey.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nshall we do today?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks her.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\nwhatever you want to. I have nothing particular in mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\n\n Everything\naround them is beige. This is the average color of the universe, and\nthe universe has been reduced to its average.\n\n He\nwinces.\n\n She\nsmiles, feeling concerned but not knowing at all how to show it with\nher face.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nheadaches again?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe says. \xe2\x80\x9cJust here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\nsure they will pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe says. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n He\nhas a vision that feels like a memory, of a moment that never\nhappened on a sunny afternoon in Dallas, billions of years ago. A\nflash of red, and then a nothing, deeper even than the nothing\nthey float in now.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is right,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is\nwhat was supposed to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\nhappens as it was meant to,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, even though she is unsure of\nthat. She is, in fact, sure of the opposite.\n\n They\nfloat silently.\n\n Later,\nnothing happens.\n\n If\nhe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t died, if he had lived, lived on and led on, if he had\ncontinued and continued and continued and nothing changed, if no one\nelse ever got a chance, if the country never moved on, if he had\nlived, maybe, this is\nwhat would have happened.\n\n Or,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s how I imagine\nit, anyway.\n\n Thank\nyou for joining us on this celebration of Alternate History Week.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some exciting ones, like \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if Germany had Won World\nWar II,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if the South Had Won the Civil War,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if\nBath Mats Were Never Invented,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if (Somehow) Germany\nhad Won the Civil War?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nNight Vale Historical Society has chosen as their winner an alternate\nhistory where the Beatrix Lowman Memorial Meditation Zone was never\nbuilt. It will be added to the curriculum of all history classes from\nhere on out, and the Meditation Zone will be destroyed so that\nreality can match the story we have decided to tell about it.\n\n Well,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a shame. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just how history works sometimes, you\nknow?\n\n Stay\ntuned next for a hypothetical history that we are all making up\ntogether, continuously, just by living it.\n\n Goodnight,\nNight Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Writing rules.\nOne: write a lot. Two: read a lot. Three: if someone tells you not to\nuse adverbs or some other Elmore Leonard thing, swiftly kick them.\n\n Clip from Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead:\nAmerica has weird things in it. It has so many miles, so much space\nto put the weirdness in.\n\n Joseph Fink: Here\xe2\x80\x99s what you\nmissed this year on Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead.\n\n Clips from Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead: I\nstarted to look through your things. I had left them alone, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to get tangled in memories just yet. But now they weren\xe2\x80\x99t\nmemories. They were evidence.\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n He was bent horribly backwards, like\nhis spine was broken, and he was loosely swinging his arms back and\nforth in a circle, so that they slapped his chest and his back. SLAP\nSLAP! SLAP! He gurgled.\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6\n\n You know what I love more than\nanything else? Cruise control. I love cruise control more than I love\nmost of my family members. And \xe2\x80\x93 sorry to all aunts and uncles and\ncousins, you are great people \xe2\x80\x93 that cramp in your ankle from\nholding the gas pedal at the angle just so is the devil. And cruise\ncontrol is the host of Heaven banishing it away.\n\n Joseph Fink: Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead.\nThe complete Season One. Available right now wherever you listen to\npodcasts [transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s note: transcripts of Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead are\navailable at alicescripts.tumblr.com].\n\n Clip from Alice Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Dead:\nAlice, I\xe2\x80\xa6I wish I could have seen you again. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what\nthis always was, I just\xe2\x80\xa6I wish that I could have seen you again.\nJust that. Okay. Okay. [Heavy sigh] Whatever happens next, is\nwhat happens."
