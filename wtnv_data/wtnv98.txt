Episode 82 - Skating Rink
b"If you\xe2\x80\x99re happy,\nand you know it, then the chemtrails are finally working.\n\n Welcome to Night\nVale.\n\n Today is the\ngrand opening of the newest feature at the Desert Flower Bowling\nAlley and Arcade Fun Complex: a skating rink! Ah!\n\n Owner Teddy\nWilliams said he has loved roller skating ever since he was a child,\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s been a dream of his to build a skating rink in Night Vale.\nWilliams said skate rentals are half off during this opening rink,\nand there will be music by local DJs every Friday night.\n\n Williams\nalso clarified that there is absolutely no way there is any\nunderground city living below the rink.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndouble checked, triple checked,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way a\nportal to another civilization could be under there, because I built\nthe skating rink on top of the old pet cemetery. No confrontational\nnation will come from the ground and attack us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Teddy\nsaid he did hear occasional growls and hisses, and even a few loud\nbird-like shrieks coming from the walls, but this is most likely just\nthe ghosts of the dead animals whose corpses he disturbed when\nbuilding the rink.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll\nbe fiiiiiiine,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, as Joan Jett\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI\nLove Rock n\xe2\x80\x99 Roll\xe2\x80\x9d played loudly in the background.\n\n The\nCity Council announced today that flowers look especially pretty.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone\ngo smell the flowers!\xe2\x80\x9d they snarled wistfully in unison. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\nyou ever smelled one of those things? Just so full of color, and\nmusk, and fluffy yellow dust. Here, smell this!\xe2\x80\x9d And they threw\ndaisies all over the surprised reporters.\n\n The\nCouncil asked if the sun looked like it was smiling.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\njust stare at that thing\nall day!\xe2\x80\x9d they sneered lovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe think it is the kindest\nthing in the sky! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d The City Council then pointed up at the\nwindowless conference room\xe2\x80\x99s dropped ceiling.\n\n Well,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s so nice to hear the City Council in a good mood! I can\xe2\x80\x99t think\nof the last time they\xe2\x80\x99ve sounded so hopeful and cheery. Have they\never been in a good\nmood?\n\n But\nyou know, everyone here at the station, too, has been\nuncharacteristically friendly the past few days. Station Management,\nwho\xe2\x80\xa6I only ever see as shadows and glowing orange lights in the\ncorner office, and who regularly scream and\xe2\x80\x93 and cause the building\nto shake when the ad sales team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make quarterly goals\xe2\x80\xa6has\nbeen buying donuts for the staff. They also bought us a new claw\nhammer and a stone pounding board for making coffee.\n\n Plus,\nthis morning, they left a card on my desk thanking me. Yeah! Station\nManagement, thanking me, and\ngiving me a raise! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know I was getting paid! Oof!\n\n Well,\nso many people having a lovely day, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re having one too,\nNight Vale.\n\n Our\nnew sheriff followed up the City Council press conference with a\nreport on the growing number of strangers in Night Vale. These\nstrangers appear out of nowhere, and do not visibly move, other than\ntheir even, deliberate breaths. Sometimes they are suddenly closer,\nwithout anyone seeing them take a step.\n\n The\nsheriff said they think the strangers are just people from Desert\nBluffs, who have abandoned their wretched city to come live in Night\nVale, but that the Secret Police are looking further into rumors that\nthe strangers might be something else entirely.\n\n When\npressed about their opposition to Mayor Dana Cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s financial\nassistance of Desert Bluffs, the sheriff brought out a several\nfoot-high stone and sculpted an intricate series of interconnected\ngeometrical shapes, each one balancing the next. The reporters\nwatched the Sheriff for hours, until the sculpture was complete.\n\n The\nSheriff then added that they do not oppose the mayor on all issues.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIn\nfact, Mayor Cardinal is a good\nmayor. We just disagree on the issue of how to fight crime,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nsheriff said, still tightly gripping their stone carver. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\ninstance, I agree with the mayor about needing to open the Dog Park\nto dogs and people! I\nlove dogs! I think it would be great if folks could take their dogs\ninto the Dog Park.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nsheriff then said that they saw the cutest beagle puppy the other\nday. Really, really\ncute! The sheriff leaned close into the mic and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch\na good boy! Gooooood doooooooooooooooog!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Listeners,\num, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word that the City Council was just seen in public,\nwalking across the front lawn of City Hall, each of them carrying\nmatching black cases. Witnesses were stunned, as the City Council is\nrarely seen outside of City Hall \xe2\x80\x93 despite their constant\nvacations.\n\n Some\nreported that they heard the Council whistling Mariah Carey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAlways\nBe My Baby,\xe2\x80\x9d but others reported that that must have been the\nbluebirds fluttering around just above their heads.\n\n Some\neyewitness accounts said that the Council wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even walking, they\nwere \xe2\x80\x9cstrolling.\xe2\x80\x9d When has the City Council ever strolled? We\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know their bodies were even anatomically capable of that!\n\n Someone\nelse said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell that looks like skipping\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d But that\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous. Skipping? Is the City Council\nleaving town on another vacation? What put them in such a good mood?\n\n More\non this as it develops.\n\n And\nnow, a word from our sponsor. Here with that is Deb, a sentient patch\nof haze\xe2\x80\xa6and also, I think, our ad sales manager here at the\nstation.\n\n Deb:\nOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t work for the station.\n\n Cecil:\nBut you regularly provide me with copy for our live spots. Oh, and\nyou also read ads from various companies on the air. Do you work for\nan ad agency?\n\n Deb:\nCecil, please.\n\n Cecil:\nBut this is my show. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t actually work at the station, or\nfor the companies you\xe2\x80\x99re pitching, I\xe2\x80\x99d kind of like to know who you\nwork for.\n\n Deb:\nShhh. Not everything can be an emergency.\n\n Okay,\nthen.\n\n Human\nlisteners, today\xe2\x80\x99s show is brought to you by Pfizer. What does Pfizer\ndo? What doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nPfizer do?\n\n Whoo!\nAll the things Pfizer can help you with! We can\xe2\x80\x99t even begin to\ndescribe it to you.\n\n You\nknow what? Pfizer is indescribable. How can you put it into words\nwhat Pfizer does? You can\xe2\x80\x99t. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. No, you you absolutely\nwould not. You would not dare describe what we do.\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99re\nstill trying to describe us in your mind, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Maybe Pfizer\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t articulate enough. Maybe Pfizer can\xe2\x80\x99t trust you. You have\nbetrayed \xc2\xa0Pfizer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say no.\n\n Did\nyou just say no?\n\n Why\nare you always arguing with us!?! We give, and give, and give, and we\nnever ask for anything other than money in return. We only ask for\nmoney, and that you try not to describe us in words! And what do you\ndo? You give us lots of money, but you also\ntry to describe us in words!\n\n Pfizer.\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t even with this right now.\n\n Oh,\nstop!\n\n Cecil:\nIt sounds like you work for the pharmaceutical industry\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Deb:\nNo, not you too, Cecil! I can\xe2\x80\x99t be here anymore!\n\n [Door slams]\n\n Cecil:\nWow! The door didn\xe2\x80\x99t even move. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure how she slammed it.\n\n Listeners,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m being \xe2\x80\x93 [chuckles]\n\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m being distracted. Uh, intern Kareem has been pestering me to\nallow him to go skating. Since Station Management seems to be out of\nthe office, he thinks now\nis the perfect time to take a long break and go check out the new\nDesert Flower Skating Rink.\n\n Uhh\xe2\x80\xa6okay,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you go, Kareem, but only because it\xe2\x80\x99s a news\nstory. I want a full report on\nthe new facility, okay? This is still your work time, Kar\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n\n Oh.\nHe just skated away. I need to sit him down and talk to him about\nprofessionalism. And where he got cool skates like those. They had\nlightning bolts on \xe2\x80\x98em.\n\n But\nfirst, we\xe2\x80\x99ve just received a call from a controversial figure.\nCalling in from the jailhouse (I presume), while on trial.\n\n Listeners,\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s go now to an exclusive interview with literal five-headed\ndragon Hiram McDaniels.\n\n Hello,\nHiram.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head:\nHowdy, Cecil. Uh, thanks for letting me on your show. I just, uh,\nwanted to call in and\xe2\x80\xa6y'know, clear up a few things about this\ntrial.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green head:\nWe will burn the\ncourthouse to the ground! We will char the already charred remains of\nthe human judge and jury!\n\n Cecil:\nMy understanding is that the jury is not all human. It\xe2\x80\x99s a jury of\npeers, Hiram.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: Well, now, uh, my green\nhead is speaking metaphorically.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green\nhead: We\nwill scorch the scales of justice!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: Yeah, like that.\n\n The\nthing is, Cecil, uh, they are using computers to simulate five-headed\ndragons on the jury, but now they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that a single five-headed\ndragon computer program counts as five separate jurors. So they\xe2\x80\x99re\nonly making one computer and then choosing seven human jury members.\nThat hardly seems fair.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gray\nhead: They don\xe2\x80\x99t respect us at\nall.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: No, no they don\xe2\x80\x99t, gray\nhead. They really don\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n Plus,\nno computer can recreate the complexities of sentient dragons.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gray\nhead: It\xe2\x80\x99s offensive.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I know they looked for actual\nfive-headed dragons, but there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many out there that the city\ncan find.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold head:\nWell, my sister Hadassah is in town. I think she should be\nconsidered.\n\n Cecil:\nFamily members of the accused generally aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed on juries. But\nalso, one of your heads, the violet one, is going to be a witness\nagainst you at the trial. Uh, how are things going within your own\nbody?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: They\xe2\x80\x99ve put a hole in my\ncell wall so my violet head can be outside of the jail, since, uh, he\nis not charged with any crime.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: I can hear you\nconspiring against me!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green\nhead: Quiet,\nyou traitorous stink! I will chew you from\xe2\x80\x93\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: Hey, easy, Green. You\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot allowed to talk to Violet anymore. It would be witness tampering.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s blue\nhead: We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be\ntalking to the media. Our lawyer said anything we say can be used in\nthe trial.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: My blue head is right,\nCecil. I just wanted to use my phone call to get the word out about\nthe unfair practices going on in this trial.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gray\nhead: It is so unfair.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly look into this. Uh, are you having an okay day\notherwise, Hiram?\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: I sure am, Cecil. Eh,\ndespite my circumstances, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s in pretty good spirits today.\nThey, uh, served raw lamb in the mess hall and they let us watch a\nwhole hour of the Lee Marvin marathon on the C-SPAN this afternoon.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green\nhead: They\nshowed Death\nHunt! It was his finest work as an actor!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gray\nhead: I think Gorky\nPark was one of his more interesting roles. But yeah\xe2\x80\xa6Death Hunt\nis pretty good.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s blue\nhead: Lee Marvin is a lighthouse\nin a stormy cinematic sea.\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s\nviolet head: I personally prefer\nCat\nBallou!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s green\nhead: Silence,\nyou withered newt!\n\n Hiram\xe2\x80\x99s gold\nhead: All right there, Green.\n\n Hey,\nuh, thanks for taking my call, Cecil.\n\n Cecil:\nNo, thank you, Hiram.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re\ngetting good news from Teddy Williams down at the new skating rink\nthat there are record crowds. So many people are showing up to skate.\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize how popular roller skating would be here.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99re\nalso getting bad news from Teddy that all of the lights have gone\nout. He\xe2\x80\x99s hearing deep growls coming from not only the ghost pets in\nthe walls, but loud shouts and snarls coming from the skaters\nthemselves. He cannot see who it is, but he can definitely smell the\nmetallic briny stench of blood.\n\n He\ndid not care to elaborate about how he is so familiar with the smell\nof blood, just that he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of an expert in the matter and it\xe2\x80\x99s\ndefinitely blood, and\nthat no one else should come to the skating rink.\n\n He\nwhispered all of this from underneath the turntable of the DJ booth.\n\n He\nreported seeing looming shadows in the near-black, the shadows of\nhulking figures with what appeared to be either antlers or very\nelaborate hats. He could feel the floor trembling beneath him, as if\nthere were a stampede of beasts or a clash of angry gods.\n\n Williams\nreported that he just once \xe2\x80\x93 just one time in his life!\n\xe2\x80\x93 wants people to be able to play arcade games and skate and bowl\nand drink sodas without fearing for their safety.\n\n Listeners,\ndo not go\nto the skating rink. And for those of you already there, take\ncover! Do not come out from your\nhiding place! Not even if they put on Pat\nBenatar!\n\n As\nI wait for further news from Intern Kareem at the skating rink, let\nme take you now to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cThinking\nof Milk\xe2\x80\x9d by Tristan Haze]\n\n Despite\nhaving a terrifying start, the new skating rink sounds like a huge\nsuccess, and everyone seems to be having fun again.\n\n It\nis clear now what has happened.\n\n Intern\nKareem said that when he arrived at the skating rink, he saw almost\neveryone from Night Vale. Leann Hart from the Daily Journal, John\nPeters (you know, the farmer?), Old Woman Josie, and the beings\nKareem insists on calling angels. Judge Siobhan Azdaq, even the City\nCouncil was there! Their black cases were all opened, revealing white\nretro skates with thick red and blue piping.\n\n It\nwas a feel-good atmosphere on a feel-good day.\n\n Kareem\nbought a soda, filled it with every flavor from the fountain, and put\nhis bag in a locker. \xe2\x80\x9cElectric\nLady\xe2\x80\x9d by Janelle Mon\xc3\xa1e was on and he raced to the floor to\nhave his first skate to his favorite song, only to see a group of\nhulking figures with elaborate hats enter. Kareem stopped dead in his\ntracks, standing and shivering in front of this menacing group.\n\n Kareem\nhad never seen them before, but he recognized them immediately by\ntheir sound and their smell as the management of this radio station.\n\n Kareem\nstiffened up and prepared an explanation, that he was here to work,\nuh, to report on the new skating rink, and\xe2\x80\x93 and that he was not\nslacking. But Station Management did not seem to notice him. They\nwere gazing across the room at the City Council who, by this point,\nhad all donned short shorts and headbands, and were twirling and\nspinning in unison around the rink.\n\n Just\nas Beyonc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cXO\xe2\x80\x9d\nstarted playing, the City Council and Station Management all made eye\ncontact. Station Management and City Council skated toward each\nother, and everything went dark. The record player scratched, and all\nwent quiet\xe2\x80\xa6save for horrifying growls and animal screeching.\n\n Kareem\ncould smell something briny and metallic, like olives.\n\n While\neveryone scrambled to hide in fear, Kareem \xe2\x80\x93 himself a young man in\na new relationship \xe2\x80\x93 knew exactly what was going on. He put on the\nnight vision goggles we require every one of our interns to carry at\nall times, and he watched as Station Management and the City Council\nmet in the middle of the rink, joining arms, skating in slow happy\ncircles, intermittently placing heads on shoulders, wanting to sneak\nkisses, but uncertain of the right moments, dozens of figures with\nhundreds of fingers\nall intertwined in defiance of our understandings of physical\ndimension, sighing hotly with romantic need and burning anticipation.\n\n The\nCity Council had brought live rodents, and they held them up gingerly\nto Station Management\xe2\x80\x99s mouths, as Management chewed off pieces of\nthe screaming creatures. When Station Management finished devouring\nthe last bites, the City Council adorably brushed pieces of tail and\nfur from Station Management\xe2\x80\x99s face, letting their fingertips\n(or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever it is at the end of whatever those appendages are)\nlinger.\n\n After\na few circles around the rink, Management and the Council left\ntogether.\n\n The\naftermath of their budding romance is clear among the brand new\npolished hardwood floor of the skating rink, swirling hearts strung\ntogether, carved into the wood with their wheels.\n\n The\nlights are back on now. Everyone is skating again. The stereo is\nblasting Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFlash\nLight\xe2\x80\x9d with Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMmmbop\xe2\x80\x9d\ncoming up next.\n\n As\na person in a long-term relationship, I know how fulfilling long love\ncan be. I also remember the days of being single, and that is also\nfulfilling. But nothing is quite so thrilling, so unexpected and\nuncertain, as that moment in between those two states \xe2\x80\x93 single and\nin love. That short fire burst of irrational passion for a\nperson\xe2\x80\xa6or people\xe2\x80\xa6or multidimensional entities you barely know but\nwith whom you maybe want to be with always?\n\n You\nknow the thrall of hopeless wanting, where you long to hold the other\nso tightly as to become one. You think it is love, even when it is\nnot. Love is patient, and understanding, and turbulent, and\nrock-like, ever confident in itself. But this early infatuation,\nthese addictions to a new other, are some of life\xe2\x80\x99s most fragile and\necstatic moments.\n\n Well\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m\nso happy for City Council and Station Management. They make a\ncute\xe2\x80\xa6couple.\n\n Kareem\nsaid that he also saw former intern Maureen, her new puppy,\nand some boy in a hoodie all brooding in the corner. Maureen appeared\nto be making sardonic jokes at the expense of the new couple, and at\nthe expense of the idea of dating itself.\n\n Kareem\nsaid the dog was really cute, but there was something about the sight\nof Maureen and the hooded boy and the puppy that upset him. I told\nKareem, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she\xe2\x80\x99s always like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Stay\ntuned next for the best hits of the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s,\n2010s, 2020s, and beyond.\n\n And\nas always, goodnight Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nproverb: Be careful what you wish for because it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t come\ntrue, and life is mostly about expectation management."
