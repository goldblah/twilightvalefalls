113 - Niecelet
b'Gooooooood eevening, fine citizens. I\xe2\x80\x99m your late night host this week, here to keep you company after sundownn. \n\n Welcome to Night Vale! \n\n As you regular listeners already know, I took over the night shifts this week, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been spending my days with a very special house guest. Well, more like one and a half house guests. My favorite cousin Sabina is visiting, and she\xe2\x80\x99s 7 months pregnant with what will be my second ever niece. Well, my first ever niece once removed. First ever niece once removed? That takes too long, let\xe2\x80\x99s do \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cniecelet\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n My sister\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Janice is a teenager. It\xe2\x80\x99s been so long since I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a new baby in my family so, if you hear a certain knowing, avuncular quality in my voice, it\xe2\x80\x99s because you are listening to an expecting uncle. I\xe2\x80\x99m already getting some of those leather patches sewed onto the elbows of my windbreaker. \n\n All week, Sabina and I have been reading baby books, and I am a veritable expert at this point. A baby at 7 months is as big as an eggplant. She can already get the hiccups and d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0-baby-vu, and has a fully developed sense of comedic timing. I\xe2\x80\x99m holding an eggplant with me here in this studio to practice supporting her neck. Also to make sure I have something to eat when I get home. Sabina\xe2\x80\x99s cleaned out the fridge pretty thoroughly.\n\n Back at my place, Sabina\xe2\x80\x99s been keeping the radio on 24/7, so the niecelet will know the owner of this dulcet baritone already loves her very much. Hello, almost-niece!\n\n Doing all this reading together, it seems crazy to learn just how vulnerable we are, when we first enter the world. Did you know that a newborn doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have kneecaps yet? That it has a hole in the top of its skull, which must be taped shut so the newborn does not escape through it during the night? It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing any of us survive to the shaming ceremonies at all!\n\n Speaking of rites of passage, the annual Night Vale Science Fair is scheduled for this Monday night. Every fourth grader is expected to report to the Rec Center for a fun-filled evening of free programs and live demonstrations. Organizers say the kiddos will have a chance to make a 1:1 scale volcano, that spews real ash and molten igneous rock. They\xe2\x80\x99ll learn how a pile of pennies can be transformed into a battery, simply by taking those pennies to Walgreens and exchanging them for a pack of Duracell double A\xe2\x80\x99s. They\xe2\x80\x99ll learn about about centripetal force by pouring a bucket full of water, and then filling out a worksheet on centripetal force. They\xe2\x80\x99ll plant a bean sprout in a Styrofoam cup that won\xe2\x80\x99t disintegrate until their grandchildren have set off on exploratory missions to find another planet that can support bean sprouts. \n\n Hmm, what else might be on the Community Calendar this week, you ask? Well, let me work at my own pace over here, OK pal? Like all jobs worth doing, this one takes focus and patience. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just rush through it. As my optometrist says, \xe2\x80\x9cmeasure twice, cut once, then do the left eye.\xe2\x80\x9d So I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s really measure four times total and cut two times, but I had an astigmatism so I ended up just sticking with contacts anyway. \n\n Sooo.. [papers rustling] let\xe2\x80\x99s see here. [clears throat] M-h-h-h-hmm, this week\xe2\x80\x99s events. On Tuesday night, head over to the Band Shell to hear a set from Ouroboros, the rock band that only plays covers of their own songs. Wednesday, Ablution in Fresca to celebrate the start of the Andorran New Year. Thursday is Thirsty Thursday. Consume no liquids. You\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get real thirsty! Friday has been indefinitely delayed by weather at O\xe2\x80\x99Hare, and is now pleading with a United representative for a hotel voucher to avoid sleeping in a plastic chair in Concourse C. \n\n Early morning on Saturday, we are in for a rare astronomical treat. The Earth will fully eclipse the Sun, blotting out its light completely, so that only a ring of wispy blue remains visible against the blackness. Now this eclipse will not be observable on Earth, of course, and to our knowledge there is no planet on which this phenomenon could be observed. There\xe2\x80\x99s just nothing on that particular vector in space, but at 4:13 AM on Saturday morning, the total eclipse will occur, and that blue corona will shine softly in the dark, like a delicate smoke ring. And that dim blue halo will represent the entirety of us. Our dramas, dreams, and disappointments. The first ride without the training wheels. Our 8th grade dances. Our double Windsors and our veils, our sleepless nights in waiting rooms. Our rush hour commuters, our dozing through recitals til the one we love goes on. Our crying in the car as the one we love leaves home. Just that thin filament of blue, on which we wage our peace. \n\n The on Sunday, tacos and gun safety with Three-eyed Bill at First Methodist. \n\n Stay tuned, savvy listeners, for in a moment I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s third quarter economic development report. To my knowledge, we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had an economic development report before for any quarter, but the press release looked official, and we all know that new municipal arms of government form all the time. Arms that then pull back to be reabsorbed by the government shoulder from which they sprouted.\n\n But before crunching those numbers, a quick message from today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor. Equinox Gym. At Equinox, we focus on the whole body. Particularly, the soft and vulnerable parts of that body. Stop by our windowless complex today to meet with a dietician about this month\xe2\x80\x99s promotion, the Zima cleanse. Or for even faster results, nothing torches calories like our calorie torch. Also, new members this week to Equinox receive 60 days of free access to our popular Judgment Spa. This has been a word from our sponsor. \n\n [booming voice] Now to business news. Whoa! Did that sound unusually powerful to you? Ooh, I sorta took myself by surprise there, like I grew a suit or something! [chuckles] [clears throat] The Night Vale Economic Development Board, or NV-ec-dev-B for short and cumbersome, sent a press release at the closing bell of the Night Vale stock exchange. The bulletin said that futures are down, way down. Although the recent past is trading briskly. In response to declining levels of interests, NV-ec-dev-B plans to incentivize consumer spending. At the start of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s business day, they\xe2\x80\x99ll launch an abject prompt campaign of xenophobia, branded as nationalism, branded as civic bride, branded as a 2008 F150 Ford truck with satellite radio, air conditioned seats, and a heavy-duty hitch to haul away whatever it is you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to hide. \n\n So make plans this weekend to head out towards the used car lot with your hands in the air and your checkbook in your mouth, to meet with a sales person about financing options. You might be surprised by how few years of indentured servitude can you get you behind the wheel of a Ford truck.\n\n You know what cars make me think of? Well, Carlos. I guess, but everything makes me think of Carlos. And his name is an anagram of \xe2\x80\x9cLo cars\xe2\x80\x9d. He\xe2\x80\x99s out of town at Erlenmeyer Flask Con this week, and I miss something fierce! But what I was going to say is that the thought of buying a car reminds me of my niecelet! It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary to think that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a teenager some day, getting her driver\xe2\x80\x99s permit, then her license, then her crossbow - going through all of these phases we all pass through. It\xe2\x80\x99s like there\xe2\x80\x99s a future attached to her already. Inside Sabina, there\xe2\x80\x99s a baby, and seated inside the baby there\xe2\x80\x99s the toddler. And within her are the blueprints for the girl. And soon, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be out here learning to play the sitar and considering vegetarianism, then voting and buying lottery tickets. Well, those are the same thing really. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to bear witness to this blooming life. Some day, she might even decide to have a niece of her own.\n\n [tearily] Oh, OK. Um, something is in young Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s eye over here. Ooh! Hang tight, team, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna run out and grab a bunch of tissues from the supply closet to remove this bothersome\xe2\x80\xa6 [key turns in lock, falls down] OK, listeners, I must admit I\xe2\x80\x99m in a state of concerned agitation here. When I tried to open the door of the studio, the handle \xe2\x80\x93 came off in my hand and and and and when I went to reinsert it, I found that the hole was (tamped) full of soft hot tar, which cannot be up to code. So now I find myself in a small, soundproof, airtight room with a doorless handle in my left hand and a handle-less door before me. I\xe2\x80\x99m uh\xe2\x80\xa6 Huh\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m- I\xe2\x80\x99m I\xe2\x80\x99m uncertain of just how to proceed, uh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine there\xe2\x80\x99s more than a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 worth of oxygen in here, even if the studio\xe2\x80\x99s potted fern works double duty on converting the carbon dioxide. \n\n Oh man and of course, I left my phone in my jeans in the other room, you know, after I changed into my professional radio hosting unitard. I, OK, I need some time to assess the situation. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to the weather. \n\n [Weather: \xe2\x80\x9cIf We Live\xe2\x80\x9d by Disparition]\n\n OK. OK, OK, alright calm down, calm down Cecil, calm down, and you can beat this. be like the patient viper who does not strike until his prey is upon him. [sharp exhale] Be like the praying mantis whose head is a guitar pick. Keep your heart rate low and your focus steady, and good God, sit down, man. Save your strength. Breathe deep enough to get the air inside your brain and think. What would an uncle do? \n\n Hmmm. Hummmmmmmm. [getting faster and higher] Hmmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmmm-hmmmmmmmmmmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh! OK, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. Easy, I just need one of you to come and open the door. [chuckles] OK, here I am behaving like I\xe2\x80\x99m alone, but of course I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone, ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all of Night Vale listening. Ooh, that is a relief! Come to think of it, I imagine hundreds of you may be on your way already, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t have the whole town rushing over all at once. That would cause traffic jams, hysteria, straightline winds gusting up to 60 knots. [laughs] If you\xe2\x80\x99re on your way, just shoot quick flare into the sky, so that everybody knows you\xe2\x80\x99re the one on the way. M-more importantly so that I know you\xe2\x80\x99re on the way. \n\n You guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s like 8 PM, you\xe2\x80\x99re not all in your PJ\xe2\x80\x99s yet. Just need one person to make the trip. It\xe2\x80\x99s like an 8-minute drive from your apartment, come on! Is\xe2\x80\xa6 Is no one listening? I mean, the memo from management at the last all-staff meeting did mention low late night ratings but \xe2\x80\x93 this is not low, this is talking into a tin can on string whose other end is tied to a fire hydrant at the bottom of the sea, this is utter futility, this is falling in the woods and no one\xe2\x80\x99s there to hear you. This is not seeing the Cecil for the trees, this is \xe2\x80\x93 Kafka meets Becket and tells him to talk to the hand. This is \xe2\x80\x93 stop, full stop. Cecil. [deep breath] This indignation does me no good at all. Just burns through my oxygen supply, which is running low already. This rate, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never survive until the morning commuters tune in. Just think, Cecil. Think like an uncle. \n\n Ooh. That\xe2\x80\x99s it! There is at least one person listening. Babies never sleep thru the night, right? So you, niecelet, you should be able to hear me. Tho I imagine the sound of my voice may be muffled by the blankets on the guest bed and Sabina\xe2\x80\x99s abdominal muscles. Alright, niecelet, I need you. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find a way to wake up Sabina. I need you to kick, brace your little elbows on the soft wall behind you and really kick! Aim for a spot under the ribs, that roof of bone above you. And again. [pants rhythmically] Kick! Good, again! [pants rhythmically] Kick! Good, again! Now give it everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve got this time! Sabina, wake up! This is an emergency! Wake u-\n\n Oh. The station phone is ringing. God I forgot we even had this. uh caller, you\xe2\x80\x99re on the air. \n\n Sabina: Hey, Cecil. The baby was keeping me up and I turned on the station and-\n\n Cecil: Sabina! Oh, thank God you\xe2\x80\x99re awake! No, no it\xe2\x80\x99s not a shtick, listen. I am trapped in the studio and I just need someone to open the door from the outs-\n\n Sabina: Oh OK, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there. But I\xe2\x80\x99m starving, I may stop by Subway for a mashed potato and Nutella sandwich.\n\n Cecil: No, please come now! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got snacks in the breakroom pantry.. I think. I\xe2\x80\x99ll set you up with some (gorb and gevilta) fish.\n\n Sabina: Alright. Hey, did you know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a faceless old woman living in your home? She keeps trying to put lotion on my belly, while I\xe2\x80\x99m sleeping.\n\n Cecil: Yeah, she does that. Listen, my spare office keys are by the lucky cat. See you soon, and thank you Sabina!\n\n Sabina: Hey, enough with the lotion, lady! \n\n Ooooohh. And thank you, niecelet! At negative two months old, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already saved a life! And somehow I get the feeling mine might be just the first of many. If you need bailing out of a tight spot some day, you know who to call. I\xe2\x80\x99m the baritone you can count on any time, kid, day or night shift. \n\n Ahhh, man! I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for that door to open so I can get a lungful of fresh air. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny how small a room can feel when you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to leave. Oh, sorry I [chuckles] forgot who I was talking to for a second. Well, as soon as you\xe2\x80\x99re out here breathing air yourself, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting you a pair of cleats and a pair of baby shinguards and a baby cape, too. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to meet you, little hero of a niecelet! But first, I\xe2\x80\x99m making your mother some midnight eggplant parmesan. \n\n Stay tuned next for the sounds of a door opening, a rush of oxygen-rich air, and a wheezing celebration of an overworked respiratory system. Aany second now. Aaaany second. Aaaaaanyyyy secondd. \n\n [long silence]\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Follow your heart. You need it. Where did it ever learn to walk?\xc2\xa0'
