Episode 54 - A Carnival Comes to Town
b'Cecil: The secret to a long life lies in how acutely you perceive time.\n\n\nWelcome to Night Vale. \n\n\nA quiet caravan of flatbed trucks rolled into town last night. The trailers were unmarked, except by age and neglect. The trucks parked along Bandera Street, in an abandoned lot in the heart of the up-and-coming Abandoned Lot neighborhood. People we do not know emerged from the trucks and began to unload tall lights and heavy speakers.\n\n\nPerhaps may of you were jostled from slumber by the faint pulsing of music that sounded like music you know, even though it was music you had never heard.\n\n\nPerhaps you woke unaware there ever was a sun, confused by your own consciousness, hearing the echoes of these unknown choruses, and found yourself singing along, mouthing familiar words placed in an unfamiliar order.\n\n\nWe do not know what these trucks have brought, or what those within them intend. All I can say is, you should not got near that abandoned lot on Bandera Street until we find out more \xe2\x80\x93 which might take a while. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very busy day. We can\xe2\x80\x99t investigate every horrifying fleet of unmarked trucks. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got more important things, like this voicemail from my boyfriend!\n\n\nCarlos: Hey, Cecil! I made so much progress today! Doug, and some of the other members of the army of warriors who roam this Otherworld desert, took me to the top of the mountain, to the lighthouse up on it.\n\n\nOh, right\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m still stuck in the desert Otherworld. How are you? I miss you!\n\n\nAnyway, they showed me the photos on the walls inside the lighthouse. One of the warriors, whose name is Alicia, and who is not a woman or a man, and who is Doug\xe2\x80\x99s partner, and who has a dog, and who is trying to make a new currency based on sand, walked me through the pictures. There were photos of living rooms, and parks, and lawns\xe2\x80\xa6photos of Night Vale.\n\n\nI asked if Alicia took these photos, because they were good photos! Colorful, well composed, alive! Alicia shook their head no, and the other warriors in the room pointed quietly back to the photos, and I saw that they were literally alive. The people and all of the things that were not people moved in the photos! Blades of grass in the breeze, small bees spiraling, a man refusing to smile \xe2\x80\x93 and all within the confines of rough driftwood frames.\n\n\nInside the lighthouse, you can see anywhere \xe2\x80\x93 although you cannot go to any of those\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cwheres.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd, as I leave this message, I can see you, Cecil! Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m watching you shave!\n\n\nOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s cute how you pull up your nose like that. Oh! But you missed a spot.\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had time to go looking for the doorway back to your dimension. I\xe2\x80\x99m learning so many things, though! I\xe2\x80\x93 I promise. I promise to return soon. This\xe2\x80\xa6desert Otherworld is just so scientifically interesting! Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the most scientifically interesting community I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen!\n\n\n[sigh]\n\n\nI love you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll try calling you again tonight. Is it even night time there? Ugh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all sense of time.\n\n\n[sigh]\n\n\nCecil: So\xe2\x80\xa6I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. All of that, and such.\n\n\nAnd now, the news.\n\n\nThe foundation is finally being laid for the new Old Night Vale Opera House. Old Woman Josie was on hand for the ceremony. In fact, she brought her own cement mixer and poured it herself. Several creatures claiming to be angels, wearing yellow and orange triangles \xe2\x80\x93 the logo of StrexCorp, now of course owned by these same creatures \xe2\x80\x93 were on hand to assist. But Josie kept slapping their many hands away when they attempted to help her with the heavy mixer and strenuous work.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine, Erika! I have this! Go get me some water,\xe2\x80\x9d Josie said, wiping her shriveled brow with a green handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t that old!\xe2\x80\x9d she said before adding, \xe2\x80\x9cHey! You forgot to record Castle last night! Make yourself useful and double-check the TiVo before I get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nOne of the supposed angels \xe2\x80\x93 all of whom are named Erika \xe2\x80\x93 pointed out that Castle is in reruns, and she could probably download the episode she missed from iTunes. There was a long pause as Old Woman Josie stared at Erika in silence, concrete churning its dull pulsing hum, onlookers forgetting to exhale, a single drop of sweat rolling down one of Erika\xe2\x80\x99s seven cheekbones.\n\n\nAnd then Josie said, \xe2\x80\x9cOK, whatever. Is the Chopped marathon on tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d and continued her pour.\n\n\nThe angel-like beings claim that StrexCorp is Night Vale\xe2\x80\x99s first angel-owned and angel-operated company. They claimed this proudly, and even placed it on their brochures and signs \xe2\x80\x93 despite the great risk of arrest and imprisonment for the felony of acknowledging the existence of angels.\n\n\nCompletion of the new Old Night Vale Opera House is scheduled for this coming Spring. Many town residents are excited and confused over the return of this cultural landmark, as none of us know what an opera is.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a type of deli?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one bystander, who shielded his eyes and asked not to be identified before dissipating into a black cloud and joining the rest of the cowardly air molecules.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard opera is a virus you get from kissing,\xe2\x80\x9d said another bystander, who was clearly former mayor Pamela Winchell wearing a fake mustache and clumsily altering her voice.\n\n\nNobody but Old Woman Josie and her mysterious friends know what an opera is. Hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll all find out soon, Night Vale! Hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. I have my doubts, though. I am sometimes more doubt than man.\n\n\nThe strangers at the abandoned lot have begun unloading the fleet of trucks, removing large metal cases from the trailers and assembling gargantuan machines covered in rust and the faint echo of bright color.\n\n\nResidents of the Abandoned Lot District, who usually just talk hopefully about a day when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be allowed to finally build homes, have reported hearing organ music and smelling deep fryers. They saw carnival workers carrying bags of strange candy and leading packs of unfamiliar loping animals into the lot. Many of the strangers wear large wigs and bright painted faces. They carry foolish hats and mangled balloons.\n\n\nListeners, I know what this is, and it is not good. A carnival has come to our city, Night Vale. I do not even know how you can protect yourself from this wicked cultural affront to our community.\n\n\nI reached out to the City Council but I just got their voicemail, which was the Council saying, in unison, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not here anymore. Good luck with whatever that is in the abandoned lot! If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to scream or cry in horror, please do so at the tone.\xe2\x80\x9d So at least their voicemail is the usual one, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get much help from them.\n\n\nNight Vale, I have only ever heard of carnivals. I never thought I would ever have to actually see one. No one knows what they will do in the face of catastrophe until they are in that face, and here I am, still not knowing what to do.\n\n\nA carnival. Oooooh, all the mysterious lights in the sky. I do not know how this carnival found us, nor what they intend, but I am certain it is not good.\n\n\nIt is rumored that our neighbors in Pine Cliff once welcomed a traveling carnival. Pine Cliff is now inhabited only by ghosts. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know if that was related to the carnival at all. They might have been that way already.\n\n\nAnd you know, there is a certain sweetness to the hastily-assembled rides, to the thought of eating air-blown pastel sugar, your boyfriend winning you a stuffed animal at the bird-mocking booth, exchanging known quantities of fiat cash for meta-fiat paper coupons. Oh, it sounds just\xe2\x80\xa6it sounds just\xe2\x80\xa6dreamy!\n\n\nNo! These wicked magicians of the midway! They must be using mind control to draw us in. Do not fall victim to\xe2\x80\xa6holding hands hotly under the cool lights, the undulating swirl and discordant fugue of the merry-go-round about us. Carlos! Oh, Carlos! Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the carnival \xe2\x80\x93 No! Stop it, Cecil! No!\n\n\nNight Vale, avoid the carnival! Hide in your homes.\n\n\nThis Thursday, at the Night Vale Public Library, is the twice-annual Cleaning of the Books. The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police Super Secret Special Forces Unit will be on hand to subdue the librarians, who regularly attempt to not only undermine our city with dangerous books, but also sink their sharp claws and pincers into library visitors before flying them off to eat or toy with or\xe2\x80\xa6whatever it is they do to their victims.\n\n\nThe Cleaning of the Books is our way of double-checking that the librarians are keeping a clean stock of municipally-approved books, such as The Biography of Helen Hunt and all four of Dean Koontz\xe2\x80\x99s novels.\n\n\nLibrarians are well-known for sneaking in books by dangerous authors. In 1988, two \xe2\x80\x93 two! copies of Pride and Prejudice were found in Night Vale. No one knows quite how many people read these copies, but the ensuing riots inconvenienced hundreds and led to the current cleaning schedule.\n\n\nNot everyone is in favor of this practice, though. New mayor Dana Cardinal issued a public rebuke of book cleaning. The mayor admitted that, while \xe2\x80\x9cbooks are pretty dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d and she \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend them for everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d we should \xe2\x80\x9cconcentrate more on protecting ourselves from the librarians themselves, who are the real danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nTeenage book lover and heroic militia leader Tamika Flynn also offered her protest of this important event, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbooks and libraries are dangerous. Which is exactly why we should protect them. Librarians are conniving and vicious monsters, but they also know how to recommend a good read. Their methods may be violent, but we must be willing to face great challenges in order to achieve great things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nTamika continued, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will grow soft without books, Night Vale,\xe2\x80\x9d as she waved her favorite copy of Helen DeWitt\xe2\x80\x99s The Last Samurai, onlookers shielding their eyes from the forbidden tome.\n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disagree too much with young Tamika, I \xe2\x80\x93 I respect her leadership and her vast knowledge of books, but\xe2\x80\xa6not everyone is cut out for reading difficult literature. Perhaps\xe2\x80\xa6perhaps we could split the difference. We could select just a few people in town who are allowed to read challenging books. That way the masses don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be exposed to complex ideas, and a small committee of trustworthy people, like Tamika, can tell us in a gentle way what those books say. Very quietly, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hear them. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be all the fun and simplicity of an intellectual oligarchy, but without all the awful reading.\n\n\nIntern Maureen has returned to our studio. She was swept away a few weeks back by an enormous gust of wind, and we thought her lost. We held services for her at the Rec Center. Her whole family was there. Many of her friends from the Night Vale Community College came, or at least, I assume they were friends from school. They all had human bodies with coyote heads, and they were eating armadillos out of a duffel bag. Huh. College kids.\n\n\nWell, we were all glad to see Maureen come home safe. Or, most of us. Her family seemed\xe2\x80\xa6disappointed, this being the second time they\xe2\x80\x99ve mourned her death in vain. They seemed emotionally exhausted. Not angry. They told her \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the last time, Maureen. This is it! No more!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnyway, today at work, Maureen\xe2\x80\x99s been doing some research into carnivals. And according to her, carnivals need money to operate. If we do not want a carnival in town, then we should just not give them our money, and the carnival will go away. Maureen has also handed me a report saying\xe2\x80\xa6oh, my! Night Vale! The carnival grounds have been completed. A 40-foot tall wheel with empty compartments spins lazily in the hot sun, as broken speakers sing cacophonous platitudes over simplistic chord progressions.\n\n\nCarnival workers are brandishing hammers next to a tower inscribed with ascending numbers and topped with an alarm bell.\n\n\nNight Vale residents have gathered near the grounds, but are not yet entering. A group of the carnival workers with white faces and bulbous noses and large shoes have opened the gates to the carnival grounds, and are cooing and beckoning our citizens to enter. These masked interlopers wish to sway you with broad toothy smiles, but they are nightmares, Night Vale. They are lies incarnate.\n\n\nRemember that we are a great town. We are a great town that does not back down to grave danger. Are we not the same town that defeated a Smiling God, and a fascist corporatocracy, and once \xe2\x80\x93 once \xe2\x80\x93 survived a Street Cleaning Day?\n\n\nI said earlier that I did not know what to do in the face of a catastrophe, but I was wrong, Night Vale. I was wrong. When I think only of myself, I am scared. But knowing I am with you, I am not scared. We are in this together. I have a community I can trust and love. There is no need to be frightened of treacherous outsiders.\n\n\nOutsiders? Wait. How did these outsiders get in? Night Vale is not so easily found, so\xe2\x80\xa6how have they so easily found it?\n\n\nOh! Ohh! The carnival gates have opened! All of Night Vale is there. Only I sit contained in my booth, helpless as usual.\n\n\nThe carnival workers smile wider, and wider, and wider, and wider. Breath is heard, loud and wet and without an obvious source. The birds are gone. There is a fearful infinity of an instant.\n\n\nI take you now, uncertain of what this next instant will bring, and none of you near a radio anyway, to the weather.\n\n\n[\xe2\x80\x9cBremen\xe2\x80\x9d by PigPen Theatre Co]\n\n\nThe carnival has left. Night Vale citizens resisted entering the metal gates. They formed a semicircle around the opening and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cInterlopers!\xe2\x80\x9d while pointing. As is our friendly, mandatory way of welcoming strangers.\n\n\nSoon the painted people backed away, closing themselves into their miserable flatbed corral. They disassembled their mechanical monstrosities and drove them away. Night Vale, en masse, waved fists and sticks and farm tools and cactuses and animal parts. Our citizens chanted curses upon the carnival.\n\n\nThe carnival employees, in their haste, left behind several artifacts of their attempted threat to our sanctity \xe2\x80\x93 our sanity. We found clear plastic bags filled with cheaply-produced dolls. There was a large styrofoam-stuffed green and orange squirrel. As the trucks drove away, proud and vigilant Night Vale citizens set the squirrel ablaze, that unholy totem of that unholy carnival.\n\n\nThe sun long gone, presumably scared away by the unexpected visitors, the happy fire of victory shone out to meet the tail lights of the retreating trucks.\n\n\nWitnesses heard the carnival perpetrators saying things like, \xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d as they made their way to their trucks. Shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell is this town?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the hell are we?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThis is definitely not Modesto!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna kill us, Stacy! Run!\xe2\x80\x9d were the verbal white flags, signaling our triumph as a town \xe2\x80\x93 as a proud community that stood for itself once again.\n\n\nAnd Intern Maureen, who is\xe2\x80\xa6hey! Maureen? You look upset. Are you upset? Is everything OK?\n\n\nUhh, Maureen does not look happy, listeners. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why Maureen is not happy about today\xe2\x80\x99s victory she helped bring about. You are part of this, Maureen! This victory is also yours!\n\n\nMaureen? Do you not love victory over outsiders who mean us harm? Maureen, do you\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\nWell! Maureen left the control booth. She just got up in a huff and left. Huh. Teenagers. I guess.\n\n\nStay tuned next for people arguing about sports. Not on the radio, somewhere else. Somewhere and soon people will be arguing about sports. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening next on the radio. I never do.\n\n\nAnd as always, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Say what you will about dance, but language is a limited form of expression.'
