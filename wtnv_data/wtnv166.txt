143 - Pioneer Days
b'We are thirsty. We cannot see. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what time it is, we are nearly here.\xc2\xa0\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Pioneer Days are upon us again. This is, of course, just the folksy rebranding that the public utilities department gives to randomly selected days throughout the year, when they cut all services without notice. The lights go out, the air conditioners grow warm, the food spoils, the water supply dries up. All residents are required to dress in the costumes of early settlers to make the whole thing feel festive and patriotic. Failure to dress in era-appropriate clothing, such as overalls and soft meat crowns, will result in punitive measures. Including being called a time traveler in a pejorative tone of voice, as was traditional punishment for all real time travelers back in the early days of Night Vale. \n\n Polls show that these civic holidays are increasingly unpopular, but this time it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different, the utilities department promises. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be way more fun, we swear. Just bear with us, you\xe2\x80\x99re so brave. You\xe2\x80\x99re all my brave little pioneers,\xe2\x80\x9d the pamphlets scattered around town assure us. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d the pamphlets continue, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is bravery but endurance? What better way to honor the struggles of our ancestors than through personal discomfort and grim acceptance? These are the values our town was founded on, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?!\xe2\x80\x9d the pamphlets shout. The pamphlets writhe on the ground. The pamphlets inhale sharply and become still. In an effort to sway public opinion on pioneer days, the utilities department has unveiled an interpretive boardwalk and historical display, set up in an open expanse of desert miles from town. The intention of the display is to bring a sense of local pride and education to the community, and to be a fun family centered activity that can take people\xe2\x80\x99s minds off the panic inducing existential questions that come from being so very alone in the dark. \n\n And now traffic. You had a dream when you were young. In the dream, you woke up on the couch after a nap just in time to see your family driving away, leaving you alone in the house. They\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that before, you\xe2\x80\x99re much too young, too small to be left alone. There are no lights on and everything is soft with shadows. You see a brown paper bag on the table. They must have left it there for you. Is it food? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to feed yourself yet. The bag suddenly lurches and tips over onto its side all by itself. A snake slides out onto the table, drops to the floor, and slithers rapidly toward you. You try to scream. \n\n This is the moment you were supposed to wake up, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dream, is it? Your whole family really did abandon you. You grew up in this house alone after that, just you and the snake. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t poisonous but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it was a good companion. It came and went without consideration for you at all, sunning itself on rocks or squeezing rodents to the death whenever it pleased, sometimes not coming home for days. You cleaned up its discarded skins during the molting season. You let it sleep curled next to your body for warmth in the winter months, even though it could only give back cold indifference in return. But you had no one else, that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it was. You still see each other once a year during the holidays out of a sense of duty. You follow each other on Facebook, but neither of you check that site anymore. You waited to wake up from this dream of your youth to find your family had never left, that they were still there with you. You are still waiting to wake from this dream. This has been traffic. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m getting more details about the Pioneer Day\xe2\x80\x99s display and celebration. Along the interpretive boardwalk, visitors will come to several viewing platforms where they will see the bleached bones of select citizens\xe2\x80\x99 ancestors, scattered across the sun scorched earth. Those who won last night\xe2\x80\x99s raffle must remit their ancestral bones by noon in order to be featured in the display. Further along the walk, spectators will be treated to an animatronic re-enactment of the battle for the scrublands, an event in which several key town founders bravely fought against the giant benevolent arthropods that used to exist in this area. As visitors will see, the beasts were all slain easily by our intrepid settlers, as the animals were unaccustomed to violence of any kind and regarded the human newcomers with only gentle curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had to die,\xe2\x80\x9d intones the robotic voice of a mechanical man in a waistcoat, as he stands triumphant among piles of enormous multi-pointed legs. \xe2\x80\x9cFor they were too visually disconcerting to live,\xe2\x80\x9d he booms. \n\n There will always be a booth sponsored by the historical society displaying repurposed slide film from random strangers\xe2\x80\x99 family vacations that have ben collected at garage sales over the years. Accompanied by plaques with made up historical narratives about the pictures. For example, there\xe2\x80\x99s one of an elderly woman playing shuffleboard on a seniors\xe2\x80\x99 cruise entitled \xe2\x80\x9cGriselda (-) the river\xe2\x80\x9d. It tells the tale of when pioneers first got to the sand wastes and there was a big scary river running through it, and how they had to risk their lives just to reach the land that we now have the privilege to take for granted. A lot of plaques have a kind of passive aggressive tone like that, actually. \n\n If you make it to the end of the walk, you will be greeted by Earl Harlan, who will demonstrate how to make cherries jubilee, a staple dish among the early Night Vale frontiers people. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feed a goose cherries until it can no longer walk or stand on its own,\xe2\x80\x9d Earl explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you light the goose on fire until its screams become whimpers, and when it\xe2\x80\x99s finally silent, you extinguish the flames. The goose\xe2\x80\x99s blackened flesh is full with tar enzymes that are very good for your skin and eyes. The red liquid pooling around it is only cherry juice. Only viscous cherry juice,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains as he dishes out samples of the boiling native cuisine directly into people\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched ravenous hands. \n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s not all. The fully immersive interactive theater segment is last. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be blindfolded and placed in the back of a cargo truck. Hours later, you will step off of the wooden blank and be free to enter into the desert, to try and find your way back home. Just like the pioneers did it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t realize how the boardwalk is designed to be completely disorienting until this moment, when you step into the endless desert and look to all horizons and see only identical sagebrush and chaparral and nothingness. As if you\xe2\x80\x99ve entered a mirrored fun house made only of hot dirt. \n\n More on Pioneer Days, but first The weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cVines\xe2\x80\x9d by Super Boink https://superboink.bandcamp.com/]\n\n As you wander lost in the desert, you first experience a dizzying sense of freedom. You can go wherever you want, the future is yours to shape. The possibilities seem as endless as the vast wasteland in front of you, but when you look behind you and realize you can no longer see the interpretive boardwalk or any other sign of human life, that sense of freedom becomes abject despair. You realize that taking risks is only fun when you have safety net. When that risk is a choice. \xc2\xa0Now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been swallowed up into the blistering wilderness, you learn that choice has always been an illusion. You must go forward. The sun sinks lower. The dark air blurs the edges. You feel a cool breeze sweep over the sand \xe2\x80\x93 and you are grateful for that. Your lips bleed. \n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s nightfall when you come to an old homestead. It has no roof and leans to one side. There is no door, but there is the shape of a door, the black rectangle of absence. You feel compelled to go in, as would anyone confronted by a structure with an entrance, but you hesitate. You recognize this place, yes. You saw it in the slide film display by the historical society. There was a picture of it taken many years ago. It depicted the same house, only it had a roof back then. It did not lean to one side, and two children, barely toddlers, were standing out front. They had no heads, they had chickens roosting on top of their necks instead. The accompanying explanation said that it was a double exposure, a photographic art form that early Night Vale settlers dabbled in to pass the time. There was a whole collection of these photos displayed: a bath tub filled with blood. A levitating skull on fire. A baked ham with long luxurious hair. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first Night Valers were incredibly adept at trick camera work,\xe2\x80\x9d the historical society insisted nervously when questioned. \xe2\x80\x9cCameras had come to town at least a hundred years before cameras were invented, due to the rampant time traveler problem back in those days,\xe2\x80\x9d they explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found the pictures in a locked trunk buried near the railroad tracks,\xe2\x80\x9d blurted a younger historical society member who was immediately shushed by the elders and relegated to selling merch. \n\n You hesitate in the yard, until you can no longer ignore the siren song of the wind through the broken bones of this place, screaming at you to enter. Inside, the only piece of furniture left standing is a kitchen table. On top sits a sealed jar packed to the brim with pickled eggs. Your child asks if she can have one. Your child is with you, she\xe2\x80\x99s ben riding on your back the whole time and you forgot all about her. That\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly alarming. How can a parent just forget their own child like that? \xe2\x80\x9cYes, honey,\xe2\x80\x9d you say, trembling with the effort of keeping your voice calm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have one.\xe2\x80\x9d You set her down and she scampers across the dusty boards, and she feeds. She feeds ravenously. She asks for a bedtime story next, it is her bedtime after all. At least she says it is. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what time it is, but somehow she senses it and you trust her instincts. \xc2\xa0Habits are comforting, rituals are important. It\xe2\x80\x99s what keeps us grounded. It\xe2\x80\x99s what prevents us from shouting uncontrollably and clutching at our eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time, there was a child who looked very much like you,\xe2\x80\x9d you begin. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupts, \xe2\x80\x9cthe child looks like you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d you say, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was actually a dog, not a child, be quiet now. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the story. A dog ran away from home and had many adventures and then returned to its family and everyone learned lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of adventures?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks. \xe2\x80\x9cUnspeakable adventures,\xe2\x80\x9d you say. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this a true story?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery story is true,\xe2\x80\x9d you say. She\xe2\x80\x99s still awake. You point through the roofless void and tell her to count the stars, hoping to bore her into unconsciousness. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no stars,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. You acknowledge that the thick dark air obscures any light that might be in the sky, but \xe2\x80\x9cwe can see them anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d you tell her, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we know the stars exist.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we know?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d you say. \n\n After she\xe2\x80\x99s asleep, you walk through what\xe2\x80\x99s left of the old house and wonder if this is your new home now. There are many things you think you see standing in doorways or huddled in corners. Luckily, most of them are not real. The only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s truly there is a nest of baby arthropods, bedded down in the tattered remains of a blood stained prairie dress. They appear to be orphaned, but they are together, intertwining all of their legs and blinking all of their eyes and wriggling as one large familial mass. You know you don\xe2\x80\x99t belong here. This is their home now, as it was their home before, long before there was ever a house. You lift your child\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping body and enter the desert once more. You look behind you and see the silhouette of a chicken-headed toddler standing sentinel in the yard. It\xe2\x80\x99s not real, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a double exposure.\n\n As light lifts itself above the horizon, something shiny catches your eye in the distance. You move towards it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing to move towards. You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel hope or motivation, only the pull of a random focal point that keeps you going forward. Eventually you come upon an enormous parking lot full of vintage cars. Some are early models made of skin and mud and some are mid-century coupes with fins and hardtops and spinal columns. Hundreds of chrome bumpers glare in the blinding half-sun of dawn. What\xe2\x80\x99s all this? you wonder in the daze.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHear yee, hear yee!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieks an individual in a tricorn hat, ringing a handbell. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?!\xe2\x80\x9d you shriek back, grabbing them by the lapels. They do not acknowledge you. \xe2\x80\x9cHear yee!\xe2\x80\x9d they cry again, but do not elaborate further. Suddenly the pounding of drums and deafening squawk of brass, a marching band is playing. Colorful streamers trail through a clear blue sky. It\xe2\x80\x99s the city parade. You made it to the end of the Pioneer Days interpretive display and celebration! You accept another liquid handful of scalding cherries and stumble home with your drowsy young still clinging to your back. \n\n As you enter your own silent house, completely free of all public utilities in celebration of Pioneer Days, you are overpowered by the scent of rotting kale in the stuffy air. And you breathe it in deeply. You rejoice. You weep. The only source of water is the puddle on the kitchen door, fed by the constant drip of the defrosting freezer. And you kneel down and drink from it, until you are satiated. \n\n Things don\xe2\x80\x99t look as bad as they once did, do they? The walls aren\xe2\x80\x99t closing in on you anymore, they embrace you. The dark screens of your electronic devices no longer reflect your own boredom back to you, they reflect only relief on your haunted face. The inconvenience of no public services pales in comparison to the night you spent merely surviving in a howling unstable universe. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about context. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about managing your expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the utilities department pamphlet was trying to tell us all along. And of course about celebrating the Pioneers spirit, something something forefathers, vintage cars and other stuff like that.\n\n But now that I think of it, we do spend a lot of our days distracting ourselves from physical reality. Maybe we really can use this time to experience life more solidly in the physical world, the way our ancestors did. Who needs modern conveniences when we have each other, right? Hold your loved ones close tonight. After all, you have nothing better to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming home now, Carlos. I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t hear me. No one can hear me. The power\xe2\x80\x99s out here in the station just like it is everywhere else. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been broadcasting anything for days now. And even if we had bee, your radios don\xe2\x80\x99t work anyway. but habits are comforting. Ritual is important. \n\n Stay turned next for \xe2\x80\x93 whatever you think you hear. Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \xc2\xa0\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: The leading cause of death is having a body.'
