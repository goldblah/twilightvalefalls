Episode 72 - Well of Night
b"Kill it with kindness. And if that\nfails, kill it with sharp sticks or knives.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n [Cecil yawns]\nI\xe2\x80\xa6I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep well last night. I imagine none\nof you slept well last night, what with all the chanting, and\nstomping? I could see from my window a stark, white V, opening\nskyward, just to the south of our apartment, with its inverted cone,\nlong shadows cutting in and out, a vertical static. I could hear a\ndistant repeated chant.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBom-bom-bom!\nBom-bom-bom!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Something\nlike that.\n\n Again,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not so unusual. When you live in a city long enough, you get\nused to the nighttime noise of car alarms, or howls of stray cats, or\nthe occasional carolers crouching by your front door singing about\nsome new god they invented in a night club. It\xe2\x80\x99s basic urban life.\n\n But\nthis chant was different. I first heard only the shouts of one or two\npeople.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBa-da-bah!\nBa-da-bah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Whatever\nthe chant was.\n\n I\nfigured they were simply college kids who discovered some dinosaur\nbones, which I understand is a thing college kids are into these\ndays.\n\n Carlos\nwas able to sleep through the sounds. He can sleep through anything \xe2\x80\x93\nalarm clocks, heavy construction, even that godawful screeching the\nsunrise makes \xe2\x80\x93 but I was in and out of light sleep all night! By\njust before dawn, the handful of chanters had grown to a large crowd.\n\n What\nwas that chant?\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBah-bah-bah!\nWah-wah-wah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n I\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell, but there must\xe2\x80\x99ve been dozens\nof them! Well, hopefully they keep it down tonight.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s\nhave a look now at the Community Calendar.\n\n Wednesday\nnight, the staff of Dark Owl Records will be holding a seance to try\nto reach the ghost of Taylor Swift. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be lighting candles and\nholding hands and playing Swift\xe2\x80\x99s newest album, \xe2\x80\x9c1879,\xe2\x80\x9d which was\nnamed after the year she was born into a human body. For the\nfifteenth time.\n\n Record\nshop owner Michelle Nguyen says it\xe2\x80\x99s important that they get a hold\nof Swift\xe2\x80\x99s ghost so they can ask her detailed questions about what\nkind of music she was into back then, because\xe2\x80\xa6well, the Dark Owl\nstaff is running out of music that no one else has heard of. They\nwant to find music that no longer exists, so they can get into that.\n\n Nguyen\nalso wants to trash-talk Emil Burliner, who was Swift\xe2\x80\x99s ex-boyfriend\nand who totally stole\nSwift\xe2\x80\x99s idea to invent the gramophone.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nhated music,\xe2\x80\x9d Nguyen said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had some pretty fly ties, so\nlike\xe2\x80\xa6I could see him inventing a pocket square, but not a\nturntable. Ugh! Did I just use the word \xe2\x80\x98fly?'\xe2\x80\x9d Nguyen added.\n\n The\nseance will be from 10:00pm to 2:00am, and there will be a live DJ,\nsnacks, whispering, and darkness.\n\n Thursday\nafternoon, the Night Vale Community Players will hold auditions for\ntheir fall production of David Mamet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOleanna.\xe2\x80\x9d Director\nChandra Richardson wants to take a fresh approach to this\ncontroversial play, stating that she plans on removing all of the\nwords and stage directions. Instead, simply presenting a stage full\nof actors juggling and/or eating things like candles, and fruit, and\nrodents. Richardson says that the original 1992 play took a literal\napproach to the broad topics of gender and power, and she wants to\nfind a more challenging metaphorical\napproach to this difficult material.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cTalking\nin English directly about a subject is a very 1990s thing to do. I\nthink we can update this story by stripping it of its language and\nnarrative, and just juggling, and eating things,\xe2\x80\x9d Richardson said.\n\n Hopeful\nactors should meet at 2:00pm at the Rec Center, and bring their own\ncandles and rodents. Fruit will be provided. No previous acting\nexperience or understanding of any specific language is necessary.\n\n Friday\nnight is the Night Vale Alive Fireworks Spectacular, put on each\nmonth by a Vague, Yet Menacing, Government Agency. Representatives\nfor the event, speaking through other\nrepresentatives, who we met in disguise, using code names, in an\nundisclosed location, said this month\xe2\x80\x99s fireworks spectacular\npromises to be the largest and most exciting of the year.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss it!\xe2\x80\x9d the representative whispered from behind a\ngranite-colored Dodge Grand Caravan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut unfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nrepresentative added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\nhave to miss it, because it is a covert and secret fireworks show.\nEveryone must stay inside. And close all doors. And window\ncoverings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n So,\nprepare a picnic and gather the family into the panic room this\nFriday night!\n\n Saturday\nis already over before it\xe2\x80\x99s even begun. Where does the time go?\n\n Oh,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not even a metaphor. This coming Saturday ended weeks ago, but\nno one knows where it went. Or why.\n\n An\nupdate on last evening\xe2\x80\x99s weird lights and chanting:\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\ngetting word that the gathering of chanters was down by the old well\nin the south of town. Now, of course, we all know the old well. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nthat well that inexplicably appeared a few days ago. We call it the\n\xe2\x80\x9cold well\xe2\x80\x9d because it\xe2\x80\x99s been a really long week\nthis week, what with getting back from vacation, and returning to\nwork, and school. Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s been super hot here this August. We\xe2\x80\x99re\nall just kind of\xe2\x80\xa6over it. So, like, two or three days feels like\nages! That well\xe2\x80\x99s been\nthere basically forever!\n\n Apparently\na couple of people noticed that, after sunset, the well emanates a\nbright light. As they approached the well, there eyes and hair\ndisappeared. And they began whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cwell of night!\xe2\x80\x9d to\npassersby. They kept repeating the whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cwell of night,\xe2\x80\x9d to\nanyone who would listen, but given that it is bad luck to acknowledge\na stranger, most people hurried by without paying too close\nattention.\n\n Eventually,\nsomeone pulled their car over near the well, and asked the whisperers\nfor directions to Chipotle. The whisperers replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwell of\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d And in a blink, the car was gone. And the driver was\nstanding next to the two whisperers, equally eyeless. Equally\nhairless. All three of them shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cWell of life! Well of life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The\nthree of them then did a series of moderate calisthenics, where they\ntook large skipping steps, bringing their knees up to their chests,\nand twirling their arms as straight sticks in conflicting circles\nabove their heads.\n\n Or,\nmaybe, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\ncalisthenics, but ritual dancing. Not sure. Both are important parts\nof a solid daily health regimen.\n\n More\non this as it develops, but first, a look at today\xe2\x80\x99s traffic.\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s\nan accident on Galloway Road, beneath the overpass of Route 800.\nEveryone is very sorry\nabout what happened. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for it to turn out like this.\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for anything to turn out like it did. It was totally\nan accident, and everyone apologizes profusely. Can you try\nto understand how something like this could happen to anyone? Can you\ntry to forgive them?\nCan you?\n\n Emergency\ncrews are on hand to help clear debris and to offer hugs and empathy\nto all those affected directly and indirectly.\n\n Moving\non, there\xe2\x80\x99s congestion in downtown right now because of construction,\nnarrowing Somerset down to a single lane. The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police\nhas sent traffic cops down there to shout, and scowl, and point.\nWhich has helped considerably.\n\n Oh,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s actually made the traffic worse, but everyone in the traffic\nfeels stronger, more\nemotionally prepared to deal with adversity than they were before\ngetting in their cars.\n\n Tunnels\nand bridges are completely clear this hour, as they are most hours,\nbecause they\xe2\x80\x99re either totally secret or off-limits to public use.\nBut today, they\xe2\x80\x99re especially clear of even the black sedans, armored\nvehicles, and windowless vans that normally clog those roadways.\n\n Listeners,\nthe Night Vale Highway Department would like to remind you to buckle\nup. Then, to hunker down. Then, to forget everything.\nThen, to remember\neverything. Then, to open your eyes to what\xe2\x80\x99s really\ngoing on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what\xe2\x80\x99s really\ngoing on? The Highway Department would like to call you all sheeple.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSheeple,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey scowl as they roll their eyes.\n\n This\nhas been a public service announcement from the Night Vale Highway\nDepartment.\n\n Here\nnow with a message from today\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor is Deb, a sentient patch of\nhaze.\n\n Hi,\nDeb!\n\n Deb:\nHi, human broadcaster! Hello, mortal listeners. It\xe2\x80\x99s back-to-school\ntime again, and the kids still need new clothes, bags, lunches,\nfalconry gear, rappelling equipment, and other basic school supplies.\nSo much stuff! Where will you find time to go to all of those stores?\n\n Well,\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to a bunch of different\nstores, you only need one store: Jo-Ann Fabrics.\n\n Cecil:\nCool! I thought, uh, Jo-Ann Fabrics only sold fabrics!\n\n Deb:\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s simply untrue. Why would you even say that?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I just assumed from the name that Jo-Ann Fabrics\nwould\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Deb:\nStop talking!\n\n Jo-Ann\nFabrics welcomes any parent too overwhelmed by school, or a life, or\nparenthood, or whatever. Anything. Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of flying, and\nyou have to get on a plane soon. The threat is real, you know.\n\n Cecil:\nI think planes are actually much safer than they used to\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Deb:\nOh my God, Cecil! Can we have a conversation for once?\n\n Cecil:\nYou\xe2\x80\x93 You\xe2\x80\x93 You're\xe2\x80\x93 You\xe2\x80\x99re right. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Deb.\nUh, I mean, the thing is, Jo-Ann Fabrics does fabrics better than\nanyone, so\xe2\x80\xa6a creative person could make clothes, and bags, and all\nkinds of stuff for their\xe2\x80\xa6kids?\n\n Deb:\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re obsessed with fabrics!\n\n Cecil:\nWell\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Deb:\nFine. Go on about your fabrics. What do I care about your petty human\nconcerns?\n\n Cecil:\nOoh! Carlos bought a nice batik at Jo-Ann\xe2\x80\x99s recently. It\xe2\x80\x99s got,\numm\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Deb:\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what batik is.\n\n Cecil:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\n Unknown deep voice:\nJo-Ann Fabrics.\n\n Deb:\nAah! What the heck is\nthat?\n\n Cecil:\nI\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t know! I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard that voice before!\n\n Unknown deep voice:\nFor all you back-to-school needs.\n\n Deb:\nOh my God! That\xe2\x80\x99s really weird.\n\n Cecil:\nYeah, it is!\n\n Unknown deep voice:\nJoooooooooooo-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnn\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\n Deb:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m outta here!\n\n Unknown deep voice:\nFaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nO\xe2\x80\x93 OK, uh, bye, Deb.\n\n Unknown deep voice:\n\xe2\x80\xa6aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabrrrrics.\n\n Cecil:\nListeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m just getting word that, right this moment, the old\nwell has begun to cast a ray of darkness upward.\n\n As the\nsun reached its apex, darkness cut across the bright day in a thin,\nlong V. The chanters, whose numbers have apparently grown into the\nhigh hundreds, are doing their strange dance, or exercise, around the\nwell, and chanting.\n\n More\nand more are joining this throng. I\xe2\x80\x99m being told that all of their\neyes are completely overgrown with skin, and that their hair doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nactually fall out. Apparently each hair retreats rapidly back into\ntheir heads like a scared worm.\n\n Uh, I\ncan see from my studio that tall funnel of black against the blue\nsky, and\xe2\x80\xa6and I can faintly hear the chanting.\n\n There\nit is.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBah-bah-bah!\nBah-wah-wah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s\nit! That is the chanting I heard last night.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWell\nof night! Well of life! Well of night! Well of life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Uh,\nlisteners, I can feel\xe2\x80\xa6the power of the chant. I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I can\nfeel my hair shortening, and\xe2\x80\x93 and re-entering my scalp. Oh, that\nfeels so\xe2\x80\xa6uh, so\xe2\x80\xa6rewarding!\n\n Well\nof night! Well of life!\n\n My\xe2\x80\x93\nmy eyes are being covered in skin, but suddenly, I can see so\nmuch! More than I ever thought\npossible! I must go to this well! With the well, I will see\neverything!\n\n Well\nof night! Well of life! Well of night! Well of life! Well of night!\n\n [Cecil\xe2\x80\x99s\nvoice fades, and a door closes, then reopens several seconds later as\nCecil returns]\n\n I\nalmost forgot. Here\xe2\x80\x99s today\xe2\x80\x99s weather.\n\n Well\nof night! Well of life! Well of night!\n\n [Door\ncloses again]\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cChildren\nof God\xe2\x80\x9d by Andrew\nJackson Jihad]\n\n Whoo!\nOh, wow! What fun that was, Night Vale! Oh, those \xe2\x80\x9cwell of life\xe2\x80\x9d\npeople are wild, but so sweet!\n\n I was\na bit nervous at first, because it\xe2\x80\x99s been years\nsince I\xe2\x80\x99ve been unwillingly inducted into a cult or a chanting\ncircle. I kind of thought I\xe2\x80\x99d get there, and everyone would see how\nout of practice I was, and boy\xe2\x80\xa6if you saw my kick steps, you\xe2\x80\x99d know\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done a jumping jack or prayer dance in forever.\n\n But,\nhere comes old Cecil, with his hair withdrawn and his eyes covered in\nflesh, ripe for the teasing, and they welcomed me without judgment or\nhesitations. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t two steps into their circle before someone drew\nblood from my neck, and everyone cheered\xe2\x80\xa6ah! What fun!\n\n Hmm.\n\n Then\nsomeone else turned into a bird-like animal, a little furrier than a\nnormal bird, and we all followed it into the well. And down in that\nwell we all chanted until the bird person touched each of our\nforeheads with its\xe2\x80\xa6bird-hoof? Or whatever birds call their feet?\n\n And\nsome of us joined hands, and droned for a little bit. A few others\nwere watching baseball highlights, and a few more were enjoying the\nhummus that someone had made.\n\n Then,\nI was back here \xe2\x80\x93 skin covering gone from my eyes, hair returned to\nmy scalp. The only thing different is that now I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing a black\nplastic poncho, cat ears, and yellow galoshes. This was definitely\nnot what I wore to\nwork, as I do not own yellow galoshes. They\xe2\x80\x99re orange.\n\n Oh, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. These are kind of orange-ish. The lighting in my studio\xe2\x80\x99s\nweird. Maybe these boots are\nmine.\n\n Yeah.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m wearing exactly what I was wearing before, I think.\n\n Anyway,\nI met some amazing\npeople today, people I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything about except the\nfeeling of love and acceptance I felt when I was with them. The\xe2\x80\x93\ntheir faces and bodies are blurs. But, for a short time, we all\nchanted and did aerobics as one. We all mattered to each other, even\nthough we knew we didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter at all. That seems wrong, I know, but\ntwo conflicting things can exist simultaneously. And they did!\nAnd it was a great moment. One I will cherish. And, one I hope to\nnever have a gain, because it would be ruined by the unattainable\nperfection of nostalgia.\n\n Ahh,\nthe old well is gone now. In its place, a barely-noticeable bulge in\nthe earth, slightly pink, and soft to the touch. The Parks Department\nhas already erected a historic plaque to commemorate the well. The\nplaque reads, \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED HERE OR WILL HAPPEN HERE.\nYOU HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED READING THIS PLAQUE. WHAT WERE YOU HOPING\nTO LEARN?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Stay\ntuned next for less of what you once were but more of what you think\nyou are.\n\n Goodnight,\nNight Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: When someone says\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a dog person,\xe2\x80\x9d I always reply, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lizard\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d And then I peel off my face."
