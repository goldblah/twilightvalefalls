Episode 75 - Through the Narrow Place
b"It\xe2\x80\x99s not the destination, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\nendless exhausting journey.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n\n\n\n\n What an exciting day for amateur\nathletes, or just anyone who enjoys moving their body (for whatever\nreason someone would want to do that). Today is the annual marathon\nthrough the Narrow Place. This yearly marathon is a family-friendly\ncharity race that takes people on a beautiful 26 mile or so course\nalong the Crooked Path, down into The Deepening, and ultimately,\nthrough the Narrow Place.\n\n Race organizers say that this will be\nthe biggest marathon yet, with all the town forced to take part by\nthe terrifying Harbingers of the Distant Prince, and that all\nparticipants will be devoured by the Narrow Place.\n\n Race board president, Susan Wilman,\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds a lot more dramatic than it is. Sorry, you know\nhow when you talk mostly with a small group of friends, you end up\ndeveloping a shared way of speaking that can be misleading, or\nmisunderstood when heard by outside ears. We just like to say that\n\xe2\x80\x98the Narrow Place will devour them\xe2\x80\x99 because what will happen is that\nthe Narrow Place will consume\nthem with an unfeeling hunger, and they will dissipate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Susan\nlaughed, continuing, \xe2\x80\x9cOh-ho-ho, there it is again! That sounds so\nfrightening when I say it that way, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it sound\nfrightening?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n She\nlaughed.\n\n Susan\nlaughed.\n\n She\nlaughed.\n\n Her\nmouth was black and featureless inside.\n\n She\nlaughed.\n\n The\nmarathon is this afternoon, and will be the end of us all. More on\nthis soon, but first let\xe2\x80\x99s get into some news.\n\n The\nDesert Bluffs City Council and Desert Bluffs Mayor Dan Cardozo\nannounced this week (via a golden press release hidden in one lucky\nSulfur Crunch candy bar) that, due to an extreme deficit in municipal\nfunding, they would have to shut down certain city services including\ntrash pickup, road maintenance, and tree monitoring.\n\n Starting\nthis Monday, citizens will have to drive their own trash to the dump,\nroads will gradually start to deteriorate under the erosion of\nparticulate desert wind, and the movements of trees will go entirely\nunwatched and unrecorded.\n\n The\nCity Council and Mayor Cardozo indicated that they had done\neverything in their\npower to prevent this shutdown \xe2\x80\x93 including requesting federal\nassistance, selling off city property, and making offerings of food\nand wine to the ancient sandstone idols out in the dunes \xe2\x80\x93 but that\nthe catastrophic loss of employment and tax dollars (after StrexCorp\nshut down operations in town) were too much for even those measures\nto make up for.\n\n StrexCorp\nSynernists, Inc., of course, was the former employer of every single\nperson in Desert Bluffs, until the company\xe2\x80\x99s rapid expansion plans\ninto\xe2\x80\xa6nearby towns\xe2\x80\xa6.led to their downfall and subsequent hostile\ntakeover by beings who are definitely\nnot angels. The not-at-all-angels closed down almost every Strex\noffice, and laid off (or, as they put it, \xe2\x80\x9cliberated\xe2\x80\x9d) all former\nStrex employees, and at this point are mostly liquidating Strex\nresources in order to fund operas here in Night Vale.\n\n Listeners,\nI feel for Desert Bluffs in their time of need. Mostly, I feel scorn\nand triumph. More on this never, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to talk about\nDesert Bluffs again.\n\n And\nnow, a much more important story: Khoshekh, the cat floating exactly\nfour feet off the ground in the men\xe2\x80\x99s room here at the station.\n\n We\xe2\x80\x99ve\nreceived all sorts of calls and emails and distress signals and\nemergency flares and Morse code spelling out \xe2\x80\x9cHELP US! HELP US! WE\nHAVE BEEN HERE FOR WEEKS! GOD SAVE OUR SOULS!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 which I can only\nassume are all signs of the public\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable desire to hear more\ncute kitty news. And what cute kitty news we have!\n\n Khoshekh\nis reaching that time in a cat\xe2\x80\x99s life when his skull is completely\nvisible, and I have been taking adorable photo after adorable photo\nand putting them on Snapchat, with captions like \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a good\nkitty?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBehold, my skull of terror!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Whenever\nI get stressed at work, I just put on protective gear and inject\nmyself with a number of preemptive antitoxins, and I go pet Khoshekh\nfor a bit and listen to the low gurgling rumble of his purr.\n\n His\nkittens are doing as well as their daddy, and some of them are\ngetting nearly as big as Khoshekh was when I first found him. My\nfavorite of the kittens is named Mixtape, and his anterior spines are\ncoming in fast. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a really big kitten when he\xe2\x80\x99s fully\ngrown \xe2\x80\x93 unmanageably huge. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be adorable!\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s\nabout it for cat news. If there\xe2\x80\x99s any more cat news, like Khoshekh\ndoing something cute, or just looking cute in any way, we will\nimmediately break into whatever ongoing news story it is that we are\nreporting, and let you know.\n\n All\nright! Let\xe2\x80\x99s do another round of my popular advice segment, \xe2\x80\x9cHey\nThere, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there, Cecil. My husband and\nI have a bet, and we were wondering if you could settle it. I think\nthat the sky is made of gas and distance, while he\nthinks that the sky is hastily-painted plywood about 30 feet above\nthe ground, built to hide us from the terrible truth of what is\nactually above us. That\xe2\x80\x99s unrelated to the bet, which is: which of us\nwears this summoning cloak better? Pictures attached. Signed,\nInsecure Summoners in Cactus Bloom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Hey\nthere, Insecure! Ooh, wow! OK. I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s a dead tie. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost\nimpossible to look bad in a summoning cloak. But more importantly,\ninstead of arguing about who looks better in a cloak, you should\nappreciate how you each interact with\nthe cloak in your own unique way. Cherish each other. Celebrate your\nsummoning cloak styles, and save your arguments for that difficult\nand unsettling matter about the sky.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there, Cecil! My teenage son,\nlike many children his age, can\xe2\x80\x99t decide what kind of person he is.\nFor instance, sometimes he is a kettle, and sometimes he is a bear,\nand sometimes he is a puddle of water. Many of these forms are\ndifficult to drive to school, and I especially\nworry about his safety when he takes a form that can fly. 'No flying\noutside,\xe2\x80\x99 I always tell him, but I worry that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t listen. What\ncan I do to help my son through this difficult time? Signed, Worried\nMom in Downtown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Hey\nthere, Worried. You would think that we would all be able to easily\nunderstand a teenager\xe2\x80\x99s struggle, most of us having been teenagers at\none point. Well, except obviously those of us who age backwards. But,\noutside of the context of a young mind, the teenage experience does\nnot have the same immediate, painful urgency that it does for those\nwho are currently living through it. It sounds like your son is\ntrying on new physical forms to see which ones work for him. Maybe\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s just searching for a physical form that other kids at school\nwill think is cool. Whatever the issue, support him. Have sympathy\nfor him, and most of all, keep him safe from others, and from\nhimself. It\xe2\x80\x99s his job to make bad decisions; it\xe2\x80\x99s your\njob to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re not bad enough to cause real damage. Good\nluck!\n\n Last\nletter:\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHey there, Cecil! I have made a\nterrible mistake, and it consumes me. My life was once a life, and\nnow it is an uncorrectable error. The arrival wakes each day, and\nfeeds. It gives, and it takes. And it takes, and it takes\xe2\x80\xa6I would\ncry, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s enough of me left anymore to make\ntears. What do I do? What do I do? Signed, Terrified in Shambling\nOrphan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Hey\nthere, Terrified! It\xe2\x80\x99s important to be able to forgive yourself for\nmistakes \xe2\x80\x93 even real doozies. Just do your best to make things\nright and move on, I say. Although, your mistake sounds\xe2\x80\xa6well, it\ndoes sound terrifying.\nI hope to hear nothing more about it.\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s\nall the time we have today for \xe2\x80\x9cHey There, Cecil!\xe2\x80\x9d Keep your\ncalls and letters and psychic pleas coming in.\n\n Listeners,\nit looks like the marathon through the Narrow Place is almost ready\nto go. Everyone in town is gathering at the starting line, with the\nhelp of the Towering Harbingers of the Distant Prince, who are using\ntheir toothy beaks and meaningful glances from their stomach eyes to\nindicate where people should stand.\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s\nlooking to be a fun race, and everyone is weeping.\n\n Larry\nLeroy, out on the edge of town, playfully tried to hide, but the\nHarbingers beat him at his own game, and the fun continued when they\ndragged him screaming to the starting line.\n\n Even\nthe City Council is in on the festivities, their ghastly powers being\nno match for the placid, unyielding might of the Harbingers.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m\nhere, too \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t think old Cecil is exempt! Me and Carlos are\nright here in matching Lycra shorts. He\xe2\x80\x99s wearing his running lab\ncoat, and the Harbingers allowed me to bring the mobile broadcasting\nequipment so I could continue to do this radio show, even though\neveryone can hear me talking live, because I\xe2\x80\x99m right here with them.\n\n Oh!\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Dana Cardinal, inaugurating the race by nervously\nchewing on a fistful of dirt. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be long now before we are all\nsurging forward, panicked, the Harbingers looming behind us until we\nare all forced through the Narrow Place. What good exercise that will\nbe!\n\n But,\nwhile we wait, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a message from our sponsors.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s\nsponsor is that gut feeling that you did something wrong, but you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think of what it could be. What was it? You feel so guilty, but\nyour guilt has no target. It circles, and circles, but cannot land.\nYou think back through the day, trying to find the source of the\ngnawing guilt, but there is nothing. And you realize that there never\nwas a specific cause. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a part of you.\n\n You\nare the guilt. You are\nthe shame.\n\n And\nthis only makes you feel more guilty, more ashamed, that these\nemotions are somehow tied into your very being.\n\n As\nAlbert Einstein famously said after he died, \xe2\x80\x9cThe call is coming\nfrom inside the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n That\ngut feeling that you did something wrong, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t think about\nwhat it could be. Try it today. And tomorrow, and tomorrow, and\ntomorrow.\n\n This\nhas been a word from our sponsors.\n\n Finally,\nI think we just have time for this week\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes before the race.\n\n Virgo:\nYou should check under your bed before you go to sleep. That way the\nthing hiding in your closet will think you haven\xe2\x80\x99t realized where it\nis yet.\n\n Libra:\nAll eyes are on you. Gross! Give them back!\n\n Scorpio:\nMars is intersecting with Mercury, which means your head is weirdly\nbig for your body, and no one wants to tell you because they don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant you to have the grace of self awareness. Ugh!\nScorpios.\n\n Sagittarius:\nYou worry too much about earthquakes and plane crashes. You\xe2\x80\x99re going\nto die of heart disease or cancer, just like everybody else.\n\n Capricorn:\nStop throwing your money away on expensive cars and nice clothes. The\nowners of those cars and outfits do not appreciate the crumpled\ndollar bills you keep throwing on them! And anyway, if you want to\nthrow something away, that\xe2\x80\x99s what garbage cans are for.\n\n Aquarius:\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been so stressed lately. Why not just sit outside tonight,\nrelax, look up at the stars, and know basically nothing about the\nworld you live in.\n\n Pieces:\nScorpions are not as dangerous as everyone thinks. Try to concentrate\non that. It\xe2\x80\x99ll help you feel a little calmer tomorrow.\n\n Aries:\nI know this is a hard time for you, Aries, but remember: 'tis better\nto have loved and lost. It\xe2\x80\x99s really great, just the best.\n\n Taurus:\nStep on a crack, break your mother\xe2\x80\x99s back. Pick up the phone, break\nyour mother\xe2\x80\x99s tailbone. Take your coffee with creamer, break your\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s femur. The wizard\xe2\x80\x99s spell has gone terribly wrong, and you\nmust not move at all until it is reversed.\n\n Gemini:\nYou will meet a tall, handsome stranger. He will introduce himself,\nyou will come to know him well, and he will know you\nwell. He will grow older. His skin will sag and thin. He will no\nlonger be handsome. He will no longer be a stranger. He will no\nlonger be most of the things he once was. He will\nbe a close friend, an old friend, one you\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, and\nwith whom you are settling down into that final stretch of life. But\nhe will always be tall. So tall. Very, very tall.\n\n Cancer:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this is bad\nnews, but the stars just say \xe2\x80\x9cAaaaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\xe2\x80\x9d\nI mean, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s a good\nsign, right? Right? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very inexact science.\n\n Leo:\nToday is your lucky day! Which is good news, because tonight is your\nunlucky night. But\nenjoy this lucky day until the sun goes down. Until the very second\nthe sun goes down. And then\xe2\x80\xa6and then\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n That\nhas been this week\xe2\x80\x99s horoscopes.\n\n Oh!\nAnd\xe2\x80\xa6here we go!\n\n Uh,\nthere are the starting guns, pointing at all of us, ready to fire in\ncase we decide not to run. Looks like the race has begun. Well,\neveryone, if we end up devoured by the Narrow Place, then at least we\nwent out with one last fun family-friendly community event!\n\n In any\ncase, while we all get moving, let\xe2\x80\x99s get the latest on the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cBlack\nEyes\xe2\x80\x9d by David\nWirsig]\n\n We\nwent along the Crooked Path, down into the Deepening. And then we\nall, whether we wanted to or not, we went through the Narrow Place.\nWe went through, and on to the other side.\n\n There\nis no other side.\n\n We\nwent there. We sent\nmessages in Morse code to the people we once had been, asking for\nhelp, but they could not help us. They were outside of the Narrow\nPlace.\n\n The\nDistant Prince was pleased. He gathered his Harbingers to him for the\ncelebration. They cooed, and merged in and out with each other,\ntaking startling forms.\n\n We\nscreamed.\n\n They\ncooed.\n\n We\nwore black coats and had never existed.\n\n The\nDistant Prince wore a golden coat, and had always existed.\n\n All\ndarkness is just a thickness of birds. There is rustling in every\nshadow, every surface is alive!\n\n We\nwore black coats and we went through it. We went through the Narrow\nPlace.\n\n So, it\nwas another great\nmarathon! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that our city government continues to encourage\nphysical activity with fun events like this, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of all of\nus for taking part. We will never\nbe the same again.\n\n But\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a little secret for you: no one is ever the same thing again\nafter anything. You are never the same twice, and much of your\nunhappiness comes from trying to pretend that you are. Accept that\nyou are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for\nthe gift it is. Work within the desires and goals of the person you\nare currently, until you aren\xe2\x80\x99t that person anymore, and everything\nchanges once again.\n\n Stay\ntuned next for a different you, and a different you, and a different\nyou again, each \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d denying their multiple nature.\n\n And\nfrom the Narrow Place, where we wear black coats and have never\nexisted, goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Drake would like to\nadd you to his professional network on LinkedIn."
