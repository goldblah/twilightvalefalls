Episode 60 - Water Failure
b"See some evil, hear some evil, speak some evil.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n\n Sorry to start the show off with such a minor issues, but the water here at the station is not working. I was trying to make coffee \xe2\x80\x93 I got out the filters, grabbed some whole beans from the larder, finely ground them using a hammer and hateful thoughts, and placed them, one ground at a time, into the coffee machine \xe2\x80\x93 but when I went to fill the carafe, there was no water. I turned the faucet handle and just heard a faint hiss.\n\n\n [Sigh]\n\n\n 45 minutes worth of coffee preparation for nothing!\n\n\n This also means the toilets aren\xe2\x80\x99t working. Fortunately, there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge ravine right next door to the station, so\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s that taken care of.\n\n\n Honestly, I \xe2\x80\x93 I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lead off my show with a personal complaint about how there\xe2\x80\x99s no water, instead of an important news story like how there are suddenly two suns instead of one, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it! I just get all worked up about a lack of coffee!\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\n\n\n But\xe2\x80\xa6yeah, there are definitely two suns now, and people are screaming in the streets. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty apocalyptic out there, with buildings being burned down and cars wrecking into fire hydrants and people running in all directions, mouths agape, clutching their heads. So stay inside, and avoid thinking too hard about the capriciousness of our only home: the indifferent universe.\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look now at sports.\n\n\n Former Night Vale High School quarterback Michael Sandero had a fantastic freshman season at the University of Michigan. He won the Heisman trophy, and his team made it to the national championship game. Unfortunately, they lost in overtime to\xe2\x80\xa6Michigan. It was the first time in college football history that a team had to play against itself in the title game. Down by three points in overtime, Sandero threw a late interception, thus sealing his team\xe2\x80\x99s loss.\n\n\n Sitting dejected on the bench, their heads hung low, and shoulders sagging under the weight of regret, Sandero and his teammates could only watch as the other Sandero and his teammates celebrated their victory over themselves.\n\n\n The winning Michigan team celebrated on the field until late into the night \xe2\x80\x93 everyone else having long since gone home, and the lights turned out \xe2\x80\x93 until a flock of starlings covered their cheering, dancing bodies, and carried them all into the sky.\n\n\n Speaking through a Russian translator, the losing Sandero said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know where I am. Where is Michigan? I am so confused right now! Who are you? Who are you?!?\xe2\x80\x9d He was staring suspiciously at his own hands and crying.\n\n\n Better luck next year, Michael! You can do it!\n\n\n Many listeners have been wondering if I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking time off work to go visit Carlos in his desert otherworld. Well, the answer is\xe2\x80\xa6maybe? I certainly would like to. I miss him so much, but\xe2\x80\xa6first, Carlos has to find the doorway between our worlds. Also, even trickier, I have to get vacation days approved by our Station Management \xe2\x80\x93 which is not easy.\n\n\n I filled out the special form to request days off, which includes writing a 2,500-word description of what I will be doing with my time away from work. It had to be exactly two thousand five hundred words. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if hyphenated words count as one or two.\n\n\n Anyway, I submitted my form last Wednesday by going to Station Management\xe2\x80\x99s office door, genuflecting, and reciting the Pledge of Employee Fealty, which is several minutes long. I was actually blocking the only path to the kitchen, so by the time I finished there was a long line of coworkers waiting on me. All of them, at some point, have gone through this same emotionally devastating process, when they wanted to visit a new nephew or go on a honeymoon or something. So, they were understanding.\n\n\n But\xe2\x80\xa6I chose to do this around noon, so they were also mostly hungry and frustrated.\n\n\n Once I finished the Pledge, I dropped the form into the drop box, which then glowed red and puffed out dark smoke. When I got back to my desk area, all of my belongings were gone, and there was just an open pit, a hole that seemed to go on into eternity. And knowing Management, it likely does.\n\n\n So the request was definitely received, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what they come back with.\n\n\n [Growling sound]\n\n\n Oh! Oh, dear! Station Management sounds upset!\n\n\n [Growling repeats]\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I d\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if\xe2\x80\x93 if it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about them on the air, or if they\xe2\x80\x99re just now finding out that the toilets aren\xe2\x80\x99t working! Um, either way, uh\xe2\x80\xa6let's\xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s move on!\n\n\n Uh, speaking of the water, [clears throat] all of the taps in our building are blowing a cool, dry air that smells of\xe2\x80\xa6toasted walnuts, maybe. Or, no! Nooo! Like French toast! Either way, it\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant. We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to turn off the faucets, but the handles just spin loosely and have seemingly no effect on the smell. We tried calling the plumber but they just screamed something about there being four suns.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cFour suns!\xe2\x80\x9d they howled into the phone, before muttering for a while about nothing being as it seems, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been duped by God, all is lost, blah-blah, something-something living nightmares. So, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to contact the Water Department directly about this issue.\n\n\n Oh! Also, I should have mentioned earlier, the two suns have now doubled to four suns. There are now four suns in the sky. So that\xe2\x80\x99s awful. But listen! Better than no sun, right? Man, days with no sun are just the worst!\n\n\n You know what\xe2\x80\x99s not the worst? The sponsor of today\xe2\x80\x99s show.\n\n\n Our program is brought to you today by Chevrolet, and their new line of all-electric vehicles. These vehicles are made entirely of electricity. You already own one. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Chevrolet inside your home\xe2\x80\x99s wiring this very moment! Your microwave, your television\xe2\x80\xa6you will have to harness that power and learn to turn pure electricity into matter, and then that matter into an operational vehicle, and then figure out how to operate that vehicle.\n\n\n But it\xe2\x80\x99s all there! Right now! In your home!\n\n\n In fact, since you already have the car, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you should have paid for it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you owe Chevrolet for the car you have? That\xe2\x80\x99s how the world works! There are no free cars, pal! Nope! Please send $45,000 to Chevrolet right now.\n\n\n Or, return the vehicle. You either pay the money, or return the car. One or the other. That\xe2\x80\x99s only fair, right?\n\n\n Chevrolet. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be reasonable here!\n\n\n Local television station Channel 6 has come under fire recently for their decision to start broadcasting into viewers\xe2\x80\x99 homes, whether viewers want to watch Channel 6 or not. Many residents have written to their government representatives, saying it must violate some law for a television news station to broadcast straight into people\xe2\x80\x99s homes without the residents even turning on their televisions.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a violation of privacy laws, right?\xe2\x80\x9d these letters often read. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely the government must step in to stop this,\xe2\x80\x9d the letters usually conclude.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWe hear your concerns, but the government cannot stop this,\xe2\x80\x9d the reply always says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe local television news station is controlled, and managed, by the government, and it is wonderful to be able to reach everyone in town at every point of the day with important news,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter always continues. \xe2\x80\x9cLike, let\xe2\x80\x99s say there\xe2\x80\x99s a tornado. A rare event here in the desert to be sure, but let\xe2\x80\x99s just say,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter always supposes. \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you know how to protect yourself from such a danger if there were no government-controlled television station that could turn on in your home and shout terse, esoteric orders in a foreign language, let\xe2\x80\x99s say Russian (it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be Russian) as slow-motion footage of salamanders running out of a rotting log plays. How would you know?\xe2\x80\x9d the letter challenges. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter declares.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not an emergency,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter concedes. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we just have something really exciting to tell you! Maybe we got a new stand mixer and we want you to see it. Or, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re feeling sad and we just want to read you some poems we wrote. So, as you can see, the trustworthy local television news station must retain its powers,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter always concludes. \xe2\x80\x9cThese powers help us care for you, citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The letter is always signed, \xe2\x80\x9cNight Vale City Council.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words are written in script dozens of times on top of itself, as if every member of the City Council signed it in a single moment, in a single space, without regard for physics or linear time.\n\n\n Listeners, the unrelenting smell coming from the faucets is\xe2\x80\xa6too much! Everyone in the office is salivating because of the delicious stench of French toast. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to work in this environment, and\xe2\x80\xa6oh, also because of the whole ravine thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling the water department right now. This is ridiculous.\n\n\n Plus, we\xe2\x80\x99re all getting woozy and starting to lose our senses of sight, touch, and longing.\n\n\n [Dialing sounds, phone rings on other end]\n\n\n Automated female voice: Hello, and welcome to the City of\xe2\x80\xa6 Automated male voice: Night Vale.

Are you still on the line?\n\n\n Cecil [Groggy]: Hello?\n\n\n Lacy: Thank you for contacting the Department of Water. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about the interruption of your service.\n\n\n Cecil: What is\xe2\x80\xa6what is happening?\n\n\n Lacy: An intense period of multiple suns this afternoon affected our communication system. In he aftermath, it looks like our computers shut off your water and started releasing carbon monoxide into your pipes. That should only happen to customers who are more than 60 days behind on payments, and your account appears to be fully paid, so\xe2\x80\xa6we apologize for the error! Your water has been turned back on. Please open all windows to allow the punitive gases to dissipate.\n\n\n Cecil: Why does it smell like French toast?\n\n\n Lacy: I bet you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why our carbon monoxide smells like French toast.\n\n\n Cecil: Yeah!\n\n\n Lacy: It\xe2\x80\x99s because French toast is pleasant, and carbon monoxide is not. We, here at the Department of Water, think, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not make unenjoyable things just a bit more enjoyable!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Cecil: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s very thoughtful!\n\n\n Lacy: It is very thoughtful! I\xe2\x80\x99m very thoughtful! Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n\n Cecil: Mmm\xe2\x80\xa6no.\n\n\n Lacy: Okay. Thank you. Then goodbye, Mr. Palmer.\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, thank you!\n\n\n Lacy: Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I just have to say something. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of unprofessional, I know, but I just wanted to say that I know who you are, and thank you.\n\n\n Cecil: Aww, well, thank you! I love hearing from fans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you like the radio show. Keep listening!\n\n\n Lacy: What?!? No! Not because you\xe2\x80\x99re on the radio! You\xe2\x80\x99re not the only one who cares about her, you know.\n\n\n Cecil: I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, her? I\xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\n\n\n Lacy: Fine, don\xe2\x80\x99t take a compliment! Not everyone\xe2\x80\x99s as thoughtful as me. Bye!\n\n\n Cecil: OK, uh, goodbye.\n\n\n Listeners, I have brought you a sub-par show today. I failed to report on the multiple suns that cluttered our sky, and sent waves of destructive panic throughout our community because I was too consumed with my own personal issues. I apologize for this.\n\n\n And, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, some vigilantes with hunting rifles shot the extra suns down so we\xe2\x80\x99re back to having just one sun! Although, the one remaining sun is currently setting in the north. So\xe2\x80\xa6we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how that goes.\n\n\n Our town is no longer consumed by weak and terrified humans rioting in the streets. Our town has returned to its normal state of weak and terrified humans huddling quietly at home.\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so preoccupied \xe2\x80\x93 with not just the water outage, but also getting vacation time so I can see Carlos again \xe2\x80\x93 that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been 100% focused on my duties as your community radio host. For this, I am sorry. I will try harder, I will report better! I will be the radio host you have counted on for\xe2\x80\xa6um, well, for however long it\xe2\x80\x99s been. Oh\xe2\x80\xa6how long has it been?\n\n\n Lacy: Time, right?\n\n\n Cecil: Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re still on the line!\n\n\n Lacy: Yup! Thanks again.\n\n\n Cecil: Thanks for what?!?\n\n\n Lacy: Ugh! Never mind, jerk!\n\n\n Cecil: Stay tuned next for time moving faster, faster than it seems, faster and faster, until it disintegrates into stardust.\n\n\n Lacy: Oh! That actually sounds fun!\n\n\n Cecil: Goodnight, Lacy.\n\n\n And goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.\n\n\n Lacy: Goodnight!\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: The reason we say \xe2\x80\x9cbless you\xe2\x80\x9d after someone sneezes is because we know they will die someday."
