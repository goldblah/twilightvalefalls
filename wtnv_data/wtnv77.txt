Episode 66 - worms…
b"We all lie dreamily upon damp earth,\nspotting clouds shaped like animals we have yet to invent.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n If you woke up today, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably\nalready well aware of the worms. It\xe2\x80\x99s been about 12 years since the\nlast round of worm-based terror in this town, but\xe2\x80\xa6they\xe2\x80\x99re back.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re doing all of the usual worm things: flying around and\ndropping trees onto cars and houses, spitting venom at people, and\neating stray cats and then leaving large mewling pellets all about\ntown.\n\n Thousands of worms have managed to\ncompletely envelop the Rec Center Annex, which is where today\xe2\x80\x99s\ncontinuing education course, Counter-Terrorism Techniques for\nBeginners, was taking place. Sadly, despite frequent pleas by many to\nclassify worm attacks as terrorism, worms remain classified as a\nlow-grade infestation \xe2\x80\x93 and thus were not covered in today\xe2\x80\x99s\ncontinuing education coursework. This means more giant squirming\npellets to clean up.\n\n Um, yeah, yeah\xe2\x80\xa6worms\xe2\x80\xa6worms,\nworms, worms\xe2\x80\xa6great.\n\n Hey. Unrelated to anything, just\nwondering, but\xe2\x80\xa6have you ever asked yourself why the Dog Park is off\nlimits? I mean, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a municipal park and all, but shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\ncitizens be able to use it?\nSeems kind of weird, right? That you can\xe2\x80\x99t just go to the Dog Park\nand hang out. Maybe even\xe2\x80\xa6bring your dog? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\nlike it contains any kind of vast desert otherworld where my\nboyfriend lives, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just a plain old Dog Park and not an alt-dimensional portal!\n\n Maybe\nour mayor will try to open up the Dog Park for public use.\nJust\xe2\x80\xa6temporarily. Say, for a few minutes. Maybe our mayor can help\nme out for once. That\nwould certainly be a friendly and mayoral thing to do.\n\n After\nyears of applications for city approval, there is finally an official\nNight Vale Book Club, listeners! The Book Club, which is run by 14\nyear-old bibliophile and heroic vigilante Tamika Flynn, will feature\nweekly discussions of popular and classic fiction, as well as Q&As\nwith book experts about some of literature\xe2\x80\x99s most famous\ncontroversies., like last week\xe2\x80\x99s heated argument about whether or not\nHerman\nMelville really wrote all of the novels which bear his name, or\njust Fight\nClub.\n\n The\nBook Club meets Tuesdays from 2:00pm to 4:00pm at Patty\xe2\x80\x99s Hardware\nand Discount Pastries. Members can candidly discuss the books without\nfear of most\ngovernment repercussions, while noshing on some delicious wheat- and\nwheat byproduct-free pastries sold at great discount to you.\n\n Patty\xe2\x80\x99s also\nspecializes in hammers, crowbars, and anything heavy that fits in\nyour hand and can be easily swung.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cShop at\nPatty\xe2\x80\x99s. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never suspect a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Patty shouts in the looped\nrecording playing from her perpetually squirming animatronic statue\nout front of her flagship store.\n\n This\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s book is Helen DeWitt\xe2\x80\x99s The\nLast Samurai. There is only one heavily-charred edition of this\nnovel left in the world, but Tamika assures us that she managed\nto\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cborrow\xe2\x80\x9d a\ncopy from the library\xe2\x80\x99s Forbidden Material Collection. She did finger\nquotes around the word \xe2\x80\x9cborrow,\xe2\x80\x9d while also shaking her head no\nand stomping \xe2\x80\x9cI am being totally facetious\xe2\x80\x9d in Morse code with\nher right leg. Then, an owl landed on her shoulder and winked.\n\n Spring\nLeague baseball tryouts are next Saturday afternoon at the Haunted\nBaseball Diamond. Children new to organized baseball will be assigned\nteams automatically, based entirely on their personal dispositions.\nThat way there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole team of courageous players, a whole team of\nclever players, one of conniving selfish players, and one\nthat\xe2\x80\xa6takes all the rest of the players. Just like the four Major\nLeague Baseball teams. Tryouts are from 10:00am to 2:00pm, with\nvolunteer coaches Betty Lucero and Lucia Tereschenko.\n\n The Night Vale\nYouth Baseball Association is asking parents to bring any extra\nbaseballs to tryouts, as coach Tereschenko died over 150 years ago,\nand is now a ghost, and so has a hard time picking up ground balls\nduring batting drills.\n\n Um,\ngetting an update on the worms\xe2\x80\xa6City Council has now elevated the\nwarning scale from \xe2\x80\x9cworms\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (with a lower-case w followed by an\nellipses) to \xe2\x80\x9cWorms!!\xe2\x80\x9d (with a capital W and two exclamation\npoints). It has not yet reached all-caps \xe2\x80\x9cWORMS!!!\xe2\x80\x9d but, if\nsomething is not done, this could become a more destructive \xe2\x80\x9cWorms!!\xe2\x80\x9d\noutbreak than the famous\n\n with all caps, one exclamation point, and underlined-twice disaster\nof 1997.\n\n You know,\nlisteners, if the worms get near the Dog Park, um, perhaps the Hooded\nFigures who pace about behind the tall black fences would get\ndistracted. And then I could\xe2\x80\xa6run in there, and get to the desert\notherw\xe2\x80\x93 ha\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\xa6I could just go check out the dogs! Catching\ntennis balls, and\xe2\x80\x93 and have a nice afternoon in a local park.\n\n Or\xe2\x80\xa6actually,\nno. No. I\xe2\x80\x99d make a break for the desert otherworld inside the Dog\nPark, and finally go visit Carlos.\n\n Or\xe2\x80\xa6you know.\nSomething.\n\n And now, a word\nform our sponsors.\n\n Too much clutter\nin your home? Do you have excess furniture? Old clothes? A couple of\nfolding bikes you never ride anymore? Jazz CDs that you no longer\nwant because you finally realized how intellectually dangerous they\ncan be?\n\n Perhaps you could\nput that stuff online for sale!\n\n There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason\nto let old junk go to waste. How does that saying go? \xe2\x80\x9cOne person\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrash is another person\xe2\x80\x99s leather bodysuit?\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s true! I bet that\ncouch of yours would look really good in, say, Denise Esposito\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s there now. We went ahead and sold your couch to\nDenise. She\xe2\x80\x99s already come and picked it up while you were at work.\n\n Also, we sold\nyour TV to Sally Jensen, and your fridge to Mario Landis, and both of\nyour cats to Pedro Renia. We sold all of your belongings, and you\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do a thing!\n\n Craigslist. We\nsold your stuff while you were gone.\n\n Due to today\xe2\x80\x99s\nworm attacks, the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police are putting their search on\nhold for literal five-headed dragon Hiram McDaniels and the Faceless\nOld Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home. After the attempted coup\nat City Hall several weeks back, the Secret Police have been\naggressively pursuing the two fugitives, who have reportedly\nconspired many times to overthrow Mayor Dana Cardinal.\n\n Mayor Cardinal\nhas been imperiled several times in the last month, only to be saved\nby someone controlling Night Vale Community Radio host Cecil\nPalmer\xe2\x80\xa6who is still quite upset about being used against his will.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cIf the mayor\nhad just asked for my help, I would have happily come to her aid on\nmy own,\xe2\x80\x9d a frustrated Palmer said, just now, into this very\nmicrophone.\n\n Palmer alleges\nthat Mayor Cardinal purchased him last year in an auction, and has\nbeen using him as her personal protector. The mayor has denied these\ncharges \xe2\x80\x93 but, like the Night Vale Constitution says, denying that\nyou are guilty is a major sign of guilt.\n\n The Secret Police\nhad previously wanted against approaching either Hiram or the\nFaceless Old Woman, as they are both deadly. But, the Secret Police\nhave been so busy dealing with the worms today, that they just can\xe2\x80\x99t\ndeal with everything on their own.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\ncould\xe2\x80\xa6help us out a bit, you think?\xe2\x80\x9d a Secret Police spokesperson\nsaid, as worms gripped his legs tighter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x93 I'm\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine. If you could find either the 18-foot tall,\nfive-headed dragon, or the omnipresent ethereal woman who you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nquite ever see, go ahead! Bring them down! Thanks for doing that. Big\nhelp. Big help,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesperson said as the worm consumed, with\none slimy gulp, the cutlass in his left hand.\n\n The\nSecret Police added they received a tip from Night Vale human Frank\nChen that he saw Hiram McDaniels flying far away, to some other\nplace. And so, Chen said, Hiram is definitely not\nstill in Night Vale.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cHiram ain\xe2\x80\x99t\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98round here anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Chen\xe2\x80\x99s long Gold Head\nstated.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI will burn\nyour frail, useless corpse, human!\xe2\x80\x9d Chen\xe2\x80\x99s scaly Green Head added.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cStop\ncalling people humans! We are\nhuman, remember?\xe2\x80\x9d Chen\xe2\x80\x99s Blue Head said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cUh,\nI mean, I am human,\nOK?\xe2\x80\x9d Chen\xe2\x80\x99s Gray Head said.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cKnock it off,\nyou guys!\xe2\x80\x9d Chen\xe2\x80\x99s Purple Head grumbled, from behind the other\nheads.\n\n Speaking of the\nFaceless Old Woman, she knows a lot about this town. I bet I could\nask her how to get into the Dog Park, how to get into that desert\notherworld. I should ask her, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to\nfind\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nAsk me what?\n\n Cecil:\nOh! Hah! Faceless Old Woman, you\xe2\x80\xa6you scared me.\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nI know. So, you want to go to the desert otherworld and visit your\nboyfriend?\n\n Cecil:\nWell, I do\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nYou are upset that the mayor has been using you to protect her from\nthose wonderful threats to her life, and you\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated by this\ntown. And you just want some time away to clear your head, and so you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have to always be saving the mayor from whatever great forces\nare trying to remove her from office.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nAnd by \xe2\x80\x9cgreat,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean \xe2\x80\x9creally incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, who\neven knows who\xe2\x80\x99s been doing all this to the mayor? I mean, I\nknow. I know everything. But\xe2\x80\xa6all of these delightful rumors and\nlies about me and Hiram\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, how can people even report such\nrumors? Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re not totally untrue, I suppose. And how on Earth\ncould I even get\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Cecil:\nBut, Faceless Old Woman, is\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nYes. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit distracted.\n\n Cecil:\nYou know how to get into the Dog Park.\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nI do. And I want to help you, because\xe2\x80\xa6well, I want you to be happy,\nCecil. I will tell you how in a dream. You will be in a boat \xe2\x80\x93\nwhich will sink, of course \xe2\x80\x93 and you will lose all of your teeth.\nAnd as you are trying to pick up your teeth, you will find an oil\npainting of a Victrola. You will then place the needle on the record\nand eat the entire painting. Your chest will open, and dozens of red\nbirds with gold ribbons in their talons will fly from you, and the\nribbons will lift your limp, open body, carrying you through the sea\nand dropping you onto a frantic eddy of pink fish near a pink reef.\nYou must wake immediately when you see the shadow of a young woman\nemerging from behind the coral. Do not look long at her.\n\n When you awake,\nyou will hear her whisper.\n\n Cecil:\nAnd she will tell me how to get into the Dog Park?\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she will tell you.\n\n Cecil:\nWell, Faceless Old Woman\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Faceless Old Woman:\nI have to go. I have to get back to keeping a distant eye on whatever\nit is that Chad is doing in that cursed home of his.\n\n You\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\nNight Vale will be fine. The mayor will be\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n Take a nice, long\nbreak, Cecil. You\xe2\x80\x99ve earned it.\n\n Cecil:\nFaceless Old Woman? Hello?\n\n She\xe2\x80\x99s gone, I\nthink.\n\n [Ominous sound of Station\nManagement in the background, sort of like what I imagine a large\ndinosaur caught in a bear trap large enough to snare a large dinosaur\nmight sound like]\n\n Listeners?\nOh, dear. I have made a bad\nmistake. I believe I have upset Station Management. I think my openly\ntalking about the Dog Park has proved to be far too political a topic\nfor this station\xe2\x80\x99s old-fashioned values that believe in not\nquestioning local, world, or secret reptilian governments, nor their\nparks.\n\n I have grown\ncavalier in my anxiousness to get out of town for a vacation, and\nthis lack of care in my job, perhaps, will lead to my end! I do not\nlike the color glowing around my studio door right now. I do not like\nthe predatorial sniffing around the door\xe2\x80\x99s edge. I do not like that\nhum, nor the heat of my skin, nor the cold in my heart.\n\n I cannot face\nthem, listeners! I can not! I just want a vacation! I just want to\nsee Carlos, for a week! A day! A\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n [Station Management goes suddenly\nsilent]\n\n An envelope!\n\n Oh, no! The noise\nand the lights are gone! All that is left is a black envelope, upon\nwhich is a single silver glyph, lightly afire. I\xe2\x80\xa6I do not recognize\nthe language, nor even the alphabet of this burning symbol. But I\nknow, in my mind, exactly what this says. I wish I did not know.\n\n I must have\ncourage. I must open this frightful news. Before I do, let me say I\nam sorry to Station Management, and to the city of Night Vale. I\nhave\xe2\x80\xa6betrayed your trust with my careless speech. If spared, I\npromise to never speak ill nor question the Dog Park again, but\xe2\x80\xa6for\nnow, I will take myself to my punishment.\n\n And I will take\nyou to the weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cLittle\nBlack Star\xe2\x80\x9d by Hurray\nfor the Riff Raff]\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6guess\nwhat? The envelope wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about the Dog Park at all. I fell to my\nknees, begging Station Management for forgiveness, but they silenced\nme immediately. They were simply letting me know that my vacation had\nfinally been approved!\n\n I was confused\nfor a moment. I asked about the burning glyph on the outside of the\nenvelope and what I thought it meant \xe2\x80\x93 which took some explaining,\nas I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to describe that particular horrifying\nexperience in English. And they laughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that glyph\nis just the ancient abbreviation for Human Resources. They\xe2\x80\x99re who\napprove the vacations around here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Then\nthey showed me the actual\nglyph that meant what I thought the other\none meant, and I lost consciousness. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure for how long.\n\n When I woke, I\nheard the whispered instructions from the woman in the coral!\n\n And then I heard\nlaughter. Station Management was\xe2\x80\xa6laughing! And I laughed, too! And\nthen they stopped laughing, or\xe2\x80\xa6growling? Perhaps it was growling\nthey were doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to say what that noise is they\nmake.\n\n Oh. Wow. Yeah, I\nthink it was growling.\n\n Aw, now I\xe2\x80\x99m super\nembarrassed about laughing.\n\n Anyway,\nthe worms. *Ahem* The\nworms have backed down, thanks to a flamethrower and fierce rhetoric\nby the City Council, resulting in some sick burns\xe2\x80\xa6both\nmetaphorically and literally. The worms have left, sure to return for\nus again someday as all of nature eventually will.\n\n Friends,\nlisteners, all of Night Vale\xe2\x80\xa6I love you. Very much. But I need time\naway to be with Carlos. Yes.\n\n And, also, some\ntime to myself. To reflect. Also, I got a message from an\nold\xe2\x80\xa6colleague? Acquaintance? Nemesis? who lives there as well.\n\n You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant to talk about it just yet.\n\n Night\nVale, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had many great years together. And I won\xe2\x80\x99t be gone long,\nbut\xe2\x80\xa6I\xe2\x80\x99ve also grown\xe2\x80\xa6weary. Weary of some friends who are less\nthan friends. Weary of fights that need not be fought. Weary of not\nbeing myself some of the time, which is something I strongly prefer\nto be all of the time.\nWeary, sometimes, of Night Vale itself, I think.\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\nWhenever. Refreshed\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\x99ll know when! It\xe2\x80\x99ll be when you hear my\nvoice again!\n\n Stay tuned next\nfor\xe2\x80\xa6oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! Anyway, time for a vacation!\n\n Goodnight, Night\nVale.\n\n [Cecil can be heard taking off his\nheadset]\n\n Goodnight!\nWhoo-hoo!\n\n [Cecil leaves the studio, and we\nhear the door close behind him]\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: When you wish\nupon a star, your dreams come true. But, because of distance, not for\nmillions of years."
