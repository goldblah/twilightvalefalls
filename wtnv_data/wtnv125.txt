Episode 106 - Filings
b'Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near? Tell me more about your special bird powers. Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long couple of weeks, as the city-wide emergency sirens that signal illegal public acknowledgement of angels have been blaring almost nonstop. But in spite of these archaic laws, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shouting \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d at beings who look like angels and then making my most friendly finger-pointing gesture. \n\n The beings who call themselves angels because\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s what they are, have begun filing the paperwork for official existence. The angels are still at the Hall of Public Records downtown waiting in line. They have made it to the front of line three different times, but each time, they were told they were missing a key form of ID or pre-application paperwork, or that the cameras could not record their image. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t told his using words, the Records Hall clerk just stabbed their paperwork repeatedly with scissors and then got a massive nosebleed, which is how they know their application was declined. \n\n Other citizens waiting have grown restless. As they do not acknowledge the existence of angels, the next person in line keeps walking up to a seemingly empty window, only to be brushed away by a clerk, or an angel. These citizens have begun shouting and crumbling and curling into little balls and sobbing, as large glowing cracks appear in the ceiling. \n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s been several days of waiting in line for the angels. We\xe2\x80\x99ll check back in on them soon.\n\n Oh, I have a new intern, listeners. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fine-looking young man with a beautiful voice, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a great future in radio. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to ask him his name or who hired him. I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t remember beginning the search for a new intern, he just appeared this morning and started working without a single word. Which is the most professional behavior for anyone beginning a new job. Well, he seems hard at work, even if every time I address him he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t notice me. It\xe2\x80\x99s great having a competent replacement for Kareem, even if I have no idea how this new intern got here and who he is. As long as the filing is getting done.\n\n Alondra Ortiz, daughter of Josefina Ortiz who passed away last month, has carried on her fight against the angels. The angels are claiming ownership of Old Woman Josie\xe2\x80\x99s estate, since they lives with her and helped her build the many artistic monuments and cultural foundations around town. Alondra said she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care if angels are acknowledged or not. If they want to be recognized, fine, but Alondra and her lawyer, Emilio Tavarez have filed motions to maintain ownership of Alondra\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s home, belongings, money, and memories. Just because a bunch of imaginary tall people with wings helped Josie change the lightbulbs from time to time, Tavarez said, that\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they are considered next of kin. Tavarez told judge Siobhan Azdaq: \xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t exist, we must get kissed.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Azdaq replied: \xe2\x80\x9cEmilio, it\xe2\x80\x99s been four years. I\xe2\x80\x99m remarried. We\xe2\x80\x99re done, OK?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n The angels have hired five-headed dragon Miriam Adelman as their counsel, who issued a literally scathing response. Alondra is now suing Adelman and her team for medical bills resulting from second degree burns. Alondra has already put Josie\xe2\x80\x99s home up for sale. She is willing to offer rebates for pre-existing damage, such as a series of large glowing slits in the walls that lead to rooms that aren\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 possible, according to the official floor plan, nor the laws of physics. These rooms range from a 17th century ball room to a crow\xe2\x80\x99s nest on a modern nazy destroyer to the space shuttle. Plus, anachronistic people keep wandering in and out of these portals. She added, \xe2\x80\x9cOn second thought, since the house has more usable square footage than originally anticipated, and because there appear to be current renters\xe2\x80\x9d, she\xe2\x80\x99s raising the sale price. \n\n So I just sent my new intern to go pick up some lunch. Or at least I said, \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me young man whose name I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet who I only think works here, can you go grab me a cobb salad with extra whipped cream and pencil shavings from the Missing Frog Salad Bar? He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say yes, nor did he ever seem to see or hear me, but he did look really frightened and ran from the room crying, which was such a polite and respectful gesture to his superior. What a nice young man. Dresses kind of weird though, so early 80\xe2\x80\x99s, with his double Windsor striped tie, polyester coat and aviator goggles, just like we all wore back in the day. I supposed most things eventually come back in fashion. Well, I can only assume he heard my lunch order. I\xe2\x80\x99m starving.\n\n Faceless Old Woman: You\xe2\x80\x99re starving? Try not having a mouth.\n\n Cecil: Oh my god, you scared me. [chuckles] Listeners, we have an unplanned visit from the Faceless Old Woman who secretly lives in your home. Or I guess in this case, your radio studio while you\xe2\x80\x99re still on the air. \n\n FOW: Cecil, we need to talk about the Distant Prince.\n\n Cecil: Few dare to speak at him, so as not to draw his attention. What do you know? \n\n FOW: His harbingers are here. They are prepared to announce his arrival with their long, toothy beaks. They\xe2\x80\x99re stomach-eyes see all. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been rehearsing this announcement in their room at the Hampton Inn \xc2\xa0on Route 800. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing and rewriting their grand pronouncement and teaching it to the court shriekers to shriek out to all of Night Vale.\n\n Cecil: What does that mean? \n\n FOW: What, \xe2\x80\x9cshriek\xe2\x80\x9d? It\xe2\x80\x99s like a painful yell. Like this: [disturbing scream] Meanwhile, the mangled servants are gathering the ears of important Night Vale politicians.\n\n Cecil: Gross.\n\n FOW: Right? And they will sew the ears onto the walls of the Hampton Inn continental breakfast bar and use them as portals into many dimensions at once. Their plan is to destroy time itself and collapse Night Vale into a dead singularity.\n\n Cecil: Why do they want to do this?\n\n FOW: It was suggested to him by a nice young woman from out of town.\n\n Cecil: What young woman? \n\n FOW: She.. she.. [music distorts, evil voice] The woman from Italy brings fun and jest, consuming all souls until none are left. Distant Prince and she plan the terrible plot: destroying all that is until all is not. I met her in dreams and found a dear friend, a woman a mortal mind can\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend. No guard controls her, no physics can hold her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll set the world on fire but leave you all colder. [music distorts back to normal] Yeah, she and I are best friends now. She\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun, really good poet. I gotta go. Steve Carlsberg is back home, and I wanna stand behind him in the mirror when he bends down to wash his face. His shrieks are the funniest. \n\n Cecil: Oh aha hahaha, dumb old Steve! Be nice, OK? \n\n We are getting reports that a dense fog is now pouring from a giant glowing slash in the sky above the Rec Center. Some pteranodons have flown out of it, as well as a commercial airliner. And those who entered the fog reported hearing shouts, blood-curdling streams, and even the echo of drums. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also the Battle of the Bands sound check happening right now at the Rec Center, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably just that. Either way, keep a close eye out for these apparent tears in the fabric of our reality. Also, go check out the Battle of the Bands. I think Diane Crayton\xe2\x80\x99s son Josh and his boyfriend Grant are organizing that event.\n\n And now a word from our sponsors. Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is brought to by a grey pigeon, whispering to you from your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s backyard. The pigeon \xe2\x80\x93 his name is Alfonso \xe2\x80\x93 is telling you that you are the one true God. [serene voice] And that he wants you to bring it a body part. A human body part. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which part. Just do it. [ominously] Soon. [serenely] \xe2\x80\x9cTime\xe2\x80\x99s almost gone. The Bible was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d the pigeon added, suddenly from your right shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never was a beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d This has been a word from our sponsors.\n\n Reports continue from the last few weeks of people all over Night Vale experiencing false realities. The most believable visions are those of tall winged beings roaming the streets and asking to borrow 10 bucks. City Council is issuing daily press releases, claiming the existence of angels is impossible and illegal. City Council is threatening to no longer speak to anyone who acknowledges the so-called angels. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are uninvited to our birthday party,\xe2\x80\x9d today\xe2\x80\x99s press release reads. \xe2\x80\x9cToo bad, there will be karaoke and minigolf. Your loss, angel acknowledger!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n A series of fissures in reality have begun to open up, revealing truths that should never have existed. Like the 12th century Scottish castle sitting atop the stables over on Galloway. Frances Donaldson at the Antiques Mall reports suddenly knowing how to play the piano, when before she only knew how to play keyboard. Larry Leroy out on the edge of town came home to find his wife, Chrysette, mowing the lawn. But he was never married. He last saw Chrysette in high school, when they were both in the lurching band together. And fired chief Ramona Encarnacion said she found a rock in the shape of Harry Styles\xe2\x80\x99 liver. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Harry is getting by without his liver,\xe2\x80\x9d Incarnassian said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr given how much mud was on this thing, how he was ever getting by with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Night Vale, beware the untruths which attempt to dismantle our town. Stay vigilent, read your journals, look at your photographs. Do your best to remember what is real.\n\n Oh man, speaking of real, I\xe2\x80\x99m real hungry. I wish my intern would get back soon with my salad. It\xe2\x80\x99s been forever since he\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, wait. He left his wallet behind. Well, strike one, new intern. How are you supposed to buy lunch if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take any money? Hope he has some cash in his pockets. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll be so annoyed if lunch is late. Ah, this is a pretty nice wallet. Trifold, ooh photo pages, human leather, money clip. I used to have one just like this. maybe let\xe2\x80\x99s find out more about you, kiddo. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Bowling league card. Ooh, I love bowling. Young reporter\xe2\x80\x99s league membership. Wow, it\xe2\x80\x99s after my own heart. Photos of him with a young man he could probably be related to and, is that my\xe2\x80\xa6 who are you? Where\xe2\x80\x99s your driver\xe2\x80\x99s license? Oh God. This can\xe2\x80\x99t.. this can\xe2\x80\x99t be. This here\xe2\x80\xa6 just\xe2\x80\xa6 \n\n Uh, OK, here\xe2\x80\x99s the weather while I sort this out. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cAll or Nothing\xe2\x80\x9d by the Dream Masons]\n\n My new intern never made it back. He never left, or maybe, was never hear at all. Or maybe still is here after all these years. \n\n After finding his\xe2\x80\xa6 my\xe2\x80\xa6 ID in his wallet, I ran out after him. But before I even got out of the building, I found him in the restroom. The door was slightly cracked and the light was on. I heard a voice, a familiar young voice. \xe2\x80\x9cLeonard said if I work hard, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a radio presenter myself some day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice. I was so frightened but still I looked into the washroom, and he was standing in front of a mirror looking right at himself. I never look into those things, or at least I haven\xe2\x80\x99t in a long time. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI think the radio station is fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the radio station is hidden. I think the radio station is like a dark planet lit by no sun. I think, therefore I soon won\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. I wanted to cry out to warn him. My mother told me to stay away from mirrors, and I knew he was in danger. I opened my mouth and tried to step in the room, but I could not speak, could not move forward. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking in the mirror,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mirror is not covered,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cStop! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look into the mirror!\xe2\x80\x9d I tried to say, but nothing came out of my mind, only spit and inaudible wheeze. Tears stung my eyes. I waved frantically, trying to catch his attention. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe flickering movement is just behind me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then he looked right at me in the mirror. His eyes grew wide and wet. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d He said again, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and then he choked. Then he screamed, then I screamed, only again no sound came out. He fell to the floor, and for a moment, I remembered. I remembered blue lights and blood in my throat, and the dark planet lit by no sun and then I forgot it. Or at least what it looked like or, only that it was, or never was or it still is. \xc2\xa0\n\n His wallet was no longer in my studio, his\xe2\x80\xa6 my\xe2\x80\xa6 driver\xe2\x80\x99s license was no longer in my hand, my familiar teenage intern was no longer lying on the ground. The mirror he was looking into is now shattered into thousands of intersecting cracks like parched desert dirt.\n\n I approached the mirror, hoping to see a face I knew: a young man\xe2\x80\x99s face I just barely remember. But I only saw a multiplicity of me, a man divided, unrecognizably under razor-sharp grounds, and behind me a glowing slash in the bathroom wall. When I turned, the whole in reality was gone. Only plain gray subway tiles. \n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is real. Myself as a younger intern, the Woman from Italy, these holes in reality. Harry Stiles\xe2\x80\x99 liver. Harry Stiles. Are any of these things real? \n\n One thing I know is real were the angels. After hours of waiting in line, their paperwork has been officially filed, with the Hall of Public Records, and a hearing date scheduled sometime between the last Friday of this month, and the last Friday of 2023. \n\n Night Vale. Reality is failing us. And strange forces are gathering. The Distant Prince, the Woman from Italy. The dragons. Huntokar. \n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we can do to save a failing reality, I only know, uh\xe2\x80\xa6 We can make real that which we acknowledge and accept. Angels are real, Night Vale. The actuality of people we rarely see or interact with may seem unimportant as fissures in our world, threatening to collapse anything we know but \xe2\x80\x93 if you see an angel, tell them you see them. Tell them they are real. Point at them and shout: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re. An. Angel!\xe2\x80\x9d we can only make real what we accept as real,. Tell them, OK? \n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night.\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Good things come to those who wait. Good things come slithering down the unctuous brown stone walls to those who wait alone in the dark pit.'
