114 - Council Member Flynn, part 1
b'At least their heart\xe2\x80\x99s in the right place, I say, softly running my hand across a plastic takeout container. Welcome to Night Vale. \n\n In light of a string of armed robberies across Night Vale, the City Council today called a press conference. They announced in unison that they are greatly disturbed by this crime wave, because it means that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to put their vacation plans on hold. They really want to find a nice autumn spot to spend a month or two leaf-peeping, maybe kayaking if the sun\xe2\x80\x99s out. But no, now someone\xe2\x80\x99s running around town waving a gun and robbing stores. Plus they have this new City Council member, 16-year-old Tamika Flynn, who they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to train. And now with all the robberies, the transition of their new member is going much more slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso,\xe2\x80\x9d they added, crime waves require so much paperwork and we\xe2\x80\x99re way behind! You people.\xe2\x80\x9d And here the Council pointed their many fingers at the gathered citizens and press. \xe2\x80\x9cYou! People!\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s robbery of the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s only resulted in the theft of 72 dollars and an endcap of Chex Party Mix. And while nobody was hurt, this was the 12th robbery in the past week. Weekday shift manager at the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s, Charlie Bear, described the robber as a slight person with a high voice, wearing coveralls and a black leather mask. The robber demanded whatever money Charlie could grab, so he emptied his bank mag of petty cash. But when he went to unlock the register, which had several hundred dollars, the robber had already left. \n\n City Council, waving their many limbs in frustration, asked for calm. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\xe2\x80\x9d they said unconvincingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x9d they repeated, but the agitated crowd continued to scream and clutch their chests. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease be chill, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fine!\xe2\x80\x9d the City Council roared with their many discordant voices from one body. But for some reason, the crowd just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling fine. \n\n And now a look at sports. The Night Vale High School wheelchair basketball team defeated the Sand Planes Snakeguarders 60 to 58 last night in the pre-season state basketball tournament. This weekend they will take on the Pine Cliff Lizard Monitors in the finals. The Lizard Monitors were the division champions last year, going undefeated in the regular season. But the Night Vale Scorpions are being led this year by sophomore point card and my niece, Janice Palmer. Janice led the division last year in assist..s, which is a statistic.. of some kind. I asked my brother in law Steve Carlsberg, who is an offensive coach on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s team, what an assist was and he explained it, at length. But I forget exactly what he said. It-it-it-it made sense at the time, it\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s like a numerical measure of how helpful a person is, and Janice led our division last year in helpfulness. So here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that continues. Good luck, Scorpions! Go get\xe2\x80\x99em, Janice!\n\n And now a word from our sponsors. Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is brought to you by the new green market co-op, which just opened up on Galloway Road between Patty\xe2\x80\x99s Hardware and Discount Pastries and one of those escape-the-room places, where you wake up in a bath tub chained to a pipe, and there\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0another person across the room also chained to a pipe, and in the middle of the room is a dead body with a gun and a cassette player? Yeah, I hear those are great fun. Green market co-op owner Tristan Cortez said he opened the new store to provide a safe space for all your produce optics and food content transactions. Too often, the people who eat food don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they are, or why they are, and they cry. They just sob in the middle of a store, afraid. Well, the new green market co-op store front on Galloway Road won\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen, Cortez said. He said he will there every day to hold your hand, to nuzzle your neck with his nose, to whisper to you: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid\xe2\x80\x9d, as he hands you an eggplant. \n\n Oh, a quick aside, listeners. Did you know that people in Europe don\xe2\x80\x99t call them \xe2\x80\x9ceggplants\xe2\x80\x9d? They call them \xe2\x80\x9caubergines\xe2\x80\x9d. They also call arugula \xe2\x80\x9crocket\xe2\x80\x9d, oranges \xe2\x80\x9cdipdops\xe2\x80\x9d, Boston lettuce \xe2\x80\x9cDublin weeds\xe2\x80\x9d, and plums \xe2\x80\x9cswole grapes\xe2\x80\x9d. Anyway, Cortez said building the new store was his daughter Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s idea. She\xe2\x80\x99s an undergraduate studying business, and according to Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s intensive research into the matter, she found having a physical location would be a huge boost in sales for a grocery store. So come on down to the brand new green market co-op. You\xe2\x80\x99re not safe anywhere but here. \n\n Only minutes after their initial press conference, the City Council called another press conference. There was no new news on the ongoing burglaries, they just wanted to say that it used to be different, this town, this whole area. \xe2\x80\x9cNah you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are centuries old,\xe2\x80\x9d the City Council said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were born in caves far beyond this desert, and we wandered until we found a place we could call home. We swam rivers, navigated forests, even climbed mountains. Yes Night Vale, there are mountains. For we have not only seen them, but crested them, and we ended up here in Night Vale. We were many-voiced, but also many-bodied then, like all of you. We wore crowns made of soft meat, and taught ourselves magical spells, and used mind control on birds!\xe2\x80\x9d the Council continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ran this town, and the people who settled here feared us! They respected us, too. Respected the blank out of us, like respect coming out the blank. Blanking respectful as blank. You know?\xe2\x80\x9d The City Council coughed slightly and asked for a can of Pamplemousse la Croix from one of their aides, as they thumbed thru their notes. \n\n \xe2\x80\x9cBut one day, our magic failed us, and our many bodies became one body,\xe2\x80\x9d the Council said, still in unison. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was Deborah that messed up the spell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cI did not!\xe2\x80\x9d came a single voice from the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s body. \xe2\x80\x9cDid too!\xe2\x80\x9d came a different single voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYour handwriting is garbage, Germaine!\xe2\x80\x9d said the first voice. \xe2\x80\x9cStop it, both of you!\xe2\x80\x9d the Council shouted in unison.\xc2\xa0\n\n They continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd over the years, our legend, our mystique, has faded in the eyes of Night Vale. We were seen as fallible, as weak, as protectors of an old guard. And now as we witnessed this new face, this young Tamika Flynn, join our ranks we are reminded that the world moves on. The world is always growing older, and younger at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d The City Council sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say is millennials are ruining everything with their civic involvement and their lack of magic, and their disregard for wearing soft meats on their heads. So entitled, this genere-\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n Just then, Tamika Flynn appeared at the site of the podium, and there was a long silnece. \xe2\x80\x9cAwkwardd!\xe2\x80\x9d The City Council sang. Tamika stepped ofrward to say she completed the paperwork to increase temporary funding for police overtime, in light of the recent wave of robberies. \xe2\x80\x9cRad, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Council. \xe2\x80\x9cDo the young people still say \xe2\x80\x98rad\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d the Council asked Tamika who replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta get back to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office to ask about financial relief for robbery victims,\xe2\x80\x9d and left. \n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a quick look at traffic. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s storms flooded the old cemetery down in the lowlands in Old Town Night Vale, and several human remains were washed out of their burials into Route 32. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, skeletons or anything. I mean, there were a few skeletons and three or four really well preserved bodies, like skin and clothing and everything, but for the most part, it was just kind of a pulpy mud that blocked the road. Transportation department crews are still working on clearing the roadways, but it\xe2\x80\x99s super gross, so the workers are vomiting a lot. Which is causing motorists on Route 32 to vomit as well, which is really slowing things down. So avoid Route 32 and take 9A instead. This has been traffic. \n\n Listeners, only minutes after their last press conference, which was minutes after the first press conference, the City Council called another press conference. This time with Tamika Flynn. They said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to teach this young one about how to council a city, so we brought her up here to shadow us. She\xe2\x80\x99s a single-voiced, separately-bodied entity. Yet, she still has not joined our form! She walks and talks separate from us, and that is not how a city council should operate!\xe2\x80\x9d they said in unison, attempting to stare down the teenage council member. \xe2\x80\x9cIt goes against Robert\xe2\x80\x99s rules of order, Miss Flynn,\xe2\x80\x9d the City Council hissed condescendingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re having a third press conference, because there was another armed robbery just now, at the Spiky Hammer coffee shop, over near the Science District. The perpetrator stole the tip jar, which contained well over 17 dollars. They also stole a French press, but like, a really nice stainless steel insulated one, not that tempered glass garbage.\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd murmured their panic, and the City Council shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine, try calming down for once, geez!\xe2\x80\x9d which had the opposite effect of calming. \n\n Tamika then leaned over and said quietly to the Council, \xe2\x80\x9cThey were calm. Listen, we can fix this, this is not a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d The City Council said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a problem!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAm not,\xe2\x80\x9d Tamika quipped. \xe2\x80\x9cYuh huh!\xe2\x80\x9d As of this report, the \xe2\x80\x9cam not\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cyuh huh\xe2\x80\x9d debate is continuing on the press podium at City Hall. The gathered crowd of alarmed citizens has begun clawing at each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces and screaming things like, \xe2\x80\x9c17 dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIt could have been us!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cA glass French press? What are we, monsters?\xe2\x80\x9d More on this story as we get updates.\n\n But next, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at today\xe2\x80\x99s weather.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9dSong For Myself'
