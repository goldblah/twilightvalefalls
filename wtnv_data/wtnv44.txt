Condos (official release)
b'This is the officially-released version of Condos, recorded on December 18, 2013 in Brooklyn, New York. If you want the version recorded in San Francisco, California on September 25, 2013, you want the Episode 31.5 transcript.\n\n\n At last, we are alone. At last we are, all of us, alone together. At last, every human, alone together, on this earth.\n\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n Thrilling news, listeners! It has come to our attention that there will be condos for sale, right here in Night Vale. Details on them are a little hazy \xe2\x80\x93 for instance, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what these condos will look like, where they will be located, who is building them, and what they will cost. But in the official brochure for the development, it does say\n\n\n CONDOS FOR SALE\n\n\n in a thick, all-caps, black scrawl.\n\n\n One local realtor, speaking under the condition of anonymity, and from within the belly of a grazing deer, said that the condos are a great investment.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cInvest your money in condos,\xe2\x80\x9d said the realtor. \xe2\x80\x9cInvest your time in condos. Invest your life. Invest emotion and hope. Invest your ideas about the future, invest your disappointment with your ongoing \xe2\x80\x98now.\xe2\x80\x99 Invest drops of blood. You lose blood all the time on frivolous accidents, now is the chance to imbue it with purpose and verve. Spill your blood for the condos!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The realtor was then cut off when the deer was spooked by a passing car and ran away.\n\n\n Listeners, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about condos. I\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about anything at all, honestly. But I do know this: condos are coming to Night Vale. They will be for sale, and this is great and exciting news for us all!\n\n\n Well, it seems that just about half the town of Night Vale is lined up outside of the Condo Rental Office, which is located in the Abandoned Gas Station on Oxford Street. Everyone is there.\n\n\n Janice Rio (from down the street), who was practically hopping up and down with excitement over owning a new condo\xe2\x80\xa6whatever a condo is\xe2\x80\xa6whatever it looks like; Leann Hart, Publishing Editor of the Night Vale Daily Journal, who was holding a bloodied hatchet, in case she came across any bloggers or online journalists who might threaten her grip on the printed word; Carlos the Scientist. Ahh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Ahhh, Carlos the Scientist.\n\n\n He was there, wearing a business-casual lab coat, and analyzing those around him with complicated devices he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain without eventually just shaking his head and muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cUhh, science.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever mentioned this on this show, by the way, um,\xe2\x80\xa6but Carlos is totally my boyfriend! I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if I had brought that up before. He\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s very handsome. And into science. And he is learning to be better about calling when he needs to cancel dates to get some experiments done.\n\n\n Where was I? Ah, yes.\n\n\n Even the dreaded Glow Cloud was there, hurling dead animals down upon those in line and intoning, to all that would listen, THE SUN WILL NOT SET AGAIN ON YOUR LIVES! ALL THAT YOU ONCE WERE NOW BELONGS TO ME! BURY YOUR FACE INTO THE BREAST OF THE EARTH AND WORSHIP THAT WHICH YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND!\n\n\n You know, it makes total sense that the Glow Cloud would want one of these condos. I mean, after joining the School Board, and sending your kid to the local school, you know, you need to have a nice place at which to raise whatever strange and terrible creature it is that constitutes your family.\n\n\n No one could see into the Abandoned Gas Station, so no one knew what the Condo Rental Office looked like. There was only a bubbling, dark movement, like a pot of boiling squid ink, and the occasional pinpoint of light, like distant, dying stars. People began to shove each other, trying to catch a glimpse of what the condos might be. There was shouting.\n\n\n Roger Singh started to point at every object in his sight \xe2\x80\x93 blades of grass, the rust shell of a former gas pump, Janice Rio (from down the street) \xe2\x80\x93 asking, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a condo? Is that a condo?\xe2\x80\x9d in a high, cracked voice.\n\n\n And\xe2\x80\xa6all right. I know this is out of nowhere, but\xe2\x80\xa6at what point in a relationship is it normal to think about living together? Is\xe2\x80\xa6let\xe2\x80\x99s say\xe2\x80\xa6buying a condo a sign that you want to move to that stage? Is that what an action like that might hypothetically be indicating?\n\n\n Oh, yes, also, Roger was holding a freshly-severed spine of an unknown animal or possible person, waving it at the bubbling dark window and howling, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a condo! What is a condo? Give me one! Will this buy me a condo?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n As of press time, no one had told him whether a spinewould buy him a condo.\n\n\n But, do you know what I mean? Like, could this be a sign that he wants to move things in that direction? You know, I just wish he would communicate more directly sometimes, but\xe2\x80\xa6scientists don\xe2\x80\x99t communicate directly. Everybody knows that. They communicate using a series of obscure and arcane codes and signals. That is what is meant to be a scientist.\n\n\n Roger has started flailing at people with the detached spine. Uhh, several people have been trampled. It is still not known whether he will be able to buy a condo with the spine. Probably not.\n\n\n [Cell phone ringing]\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to get this.\n\n\n Uhm, hello?\n\n\n\n\nCecil?\n\n\n\n\n Carlos?!?\n\n\n\n\nYes. Scientifically speaking, that is who I am.\n\n\n\n\n Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to tell you\xe2\x80\xa6you sound different lately.\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I\xe2\x80\x93 I put in new vocal cords recently.\n\n\n\n\n Uh\xe2\x80\x93 No\xe2\x80\x93 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you went in for surgery!\n\n\n\n\nNo no, I\xe2\x80\x99m a scientist. I put them in myself, easy. It\xe2\x80\x99s important that a scientist update his or her vocal cords once in a while. Otherwise, you know\xe2\x80\xa6throat spiders.\n\n\n\n\n Oh, no, I knew that. I mean, obviously I knew that. I\xe2\x80\x99m very into science. But hey, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the middle of a show!\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I know, you\xe2\x80\x99re covering the story about the condos. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I called.\n\n\n\n\n Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you listened to my show.\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you\xe2\x80\x99re on!\n\n\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n OK, hold on, listeners. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right with you.\n\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6those condos, right? They\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re very exciting, right?\n\n\n\n\n Everything is exciting, particularly existence! Existence is the most thrilling fact of all!\n\n\n\n\n Right. So\xe2\x80\xa6are you doing OK? Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting reports that it\xe2\x80\x99s even more fatal outside than usual.\n\n\n\n\n By 19 Standard Fatality Units, I know. I have a Danger Meter in front of me.\n\n\n Listen, Cecil, I called to talk to you about something important, but I\xe2\x80\x93 now I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have time.\n\n\n\n\n But time\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6isn\xe2\x80\x99t real, I know. Neither is anything else. That is the most scientific fact of all, but they\xe2\x80\x99re calling my name and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose my place in line. This is important, uh, because\xe2\x80\xa6mmm.\n\n\n I have to go, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you back later, probably. Everything is some level of \xe2\x80\x98probably,\xe2\x80\x99 nothing is a promise, it is most likely we\xe2\x80\x99ll survive to talk again.\n\n\n\n\n No I understand, I lov\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\n\n\nHey, listen, I lov\xe2\x80\x93 [talking over each other]\n\n\n\n\n Oh, um, uh, sorry, no no no, you go!\n\n\n\n\nTh\xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re calling my name, I have to\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\xa6ha\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ll call back when I can. Goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n Oh, um. OK. Um\xe2\x80\xa6goodbye.\n\n\n Uh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, listeners. Um, yeah, where was I? Um\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about your health for a moment. Let\xe2\x80\x99s concentrate on your health. Let\xe2\x80\x99s think about your health. Do you feel healthy? Pay close attention to your body and see if you feel as healthy as you thought.\n\n\n Oh! Was that a slight twinge in the muscle of your arm? That is a bad sign! That\xe2\x80\x99s a symptom of all sorts of diseases. Was that a slight sniffle as you breathed in? Sure, it could just be allergies, or a mild cold\xe2\x80\xa6but it also could be the start of tuberculosis. Does tuberculosis even start with a sniffle? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know! And so it might very well.\n\n\n Listen to your heart beating. Hear your heart beat. Feel it. Feel the one thing keeping you alive. Feel your heart beat. Are you healthy?\n\n\n Are you healthy?\n\n\n This has been a public health announcement by the greater Night Vale medical community. Their lines are open for appointments now. Please have a credit card ready.\n\n\n Ladies and gentlemen, the condos are here! They arrived, silently, in the night. They are thoroughly modern in their design. They are so modern, it is postulated they might actually be from a few centuries in the future, which is the most modern a thing can be.\n\n\n The condos are featureless black cubes. They are standing, perfect, dark forms, where the ramshackle homes and dust-worn strip malls of Night Vale once stood. And there are so many of them! They are a majestic cityscape. They are a nightmare. And they are beautiful.\n\n\n Carlos has hauled out his science equipment (of course), and is testing the cubes. The cubes emit a low level of radiation, and some sort of strange, pulsing energy. The energy would be difficult to describe in scientific terms but, if he had to give it language, he would probably use the scientific terms \xe2\x80\x9cpulsing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrange.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n The cubes do not appear to have any entrance, or windows\xe2\x80\xa6so they are similar to many of the old tract homes that were built around here in the 1950s. But, they also do not appear to have any roof or foundation, or yard, or terrace, or patio, or any other vestige of a home.\n\n\n They only have their sleek lines, their contours, their corners, the sheerness of their featureless walls.\n\n\n We do not yet know if these condos mean us harm, or well.\n\n\n We only know of their presence, and so, let us know that. Let us all hold on to that knowledge. The condos, black cubes of enormous size, are here\xe2\x80\xa6and we know it.\n\n\n And now\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\n\nCecil? Cecil?\n\n\n\n\n Um, listeners, there is a voice, but I can see no one in my studio. It is a familiar voice, and also my coffee cup appears to be three inches to the left of where it was.\n\n\n\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s me, the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home. Also, I put your coffee cup where it was supposed\xc2\xa0to be. For reasons of fate.\n\n\n\n\n Ahh, I see. Um, well, while I have you here\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\n\n It is terrible what the condos will do to you. Not \xe2\x80\x98to you\xe2\x80\x99 as in \xe2\x80\x98you,\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98to you\xe2\x80\x99 as in \xe2\x80\x98all of us.\xe2\x80\x99 But, not to me. Nothing ever really happens to me. I am completely safe from harm, and this is a great burden.\n\n\n Oh, while you were out this morning, I made your dining room table half a foot shorter. I thought it looked better that way. I hope you like it, it took me an hour with a hacksaw and a level.\n\n\n\n\n Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that lower meals means\xe2\x80\xa6faster digestion! Um, or not sure, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it. And in saying it, I am instantly believing it, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going from believing it to being violently certain about it, against all evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\n\nThanks, that means a lot. Not \xe2\x80\x98to me,\xe2\x80\x99 but your words hold a lot of meaning intrinsically. Almost everything we say does. If you looked at any word in the English language close enough, you would see within the great, glowing coils of the universe unwinding.\n\n\n\n\n Right!\n\n\n\n\nOur language holds the key to it \xe2\x80\x93 the key to the unraveling of all things. I think that one day, this world will simply talk itself to death, and I will be left to flit about in the void. I will be the Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives Nowhere.\n\n\n\n\n Now, you mentioned the condos. Let me ask you, what do you think it means when Carlos says he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at condos? I mean, did he mean that he wanted us both to look at condos together? Or was he communicating independence, like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay here, I\xe2\x80\x99m going off to look at condos alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware the condos, Cecil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n I mean, do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s looking to just buy one for himself? Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware the unraveling of all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n Or is he looking for a shared condo?\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6Hello? Hello?\n\n\n Well, I can no longer see a fleeting image of someone just over my shoulder, no flicker of movement from the corner of my eye, so I guess she\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\n\n\n Also, there are three slow walking gray roaches climbing out of my coffee cup.\n\n\n And also, I am out of coffee.\n\n\n And now, traffic.\n\n\n Picture a car.\n\n\n No, you are doing it wrong. Try again.\n\n\n Picture a car.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\xa6Really? That\xe2\x80\x99s what you picture when you picture a car?\n\n\n All right, look\xe2\x80\xa6we\xe2\x80\x99ll go with that. I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy about it, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll go with your idea of a car for now. So.\n\n\n Picture that car. And now, picture a road. Are you picturing it? Close your eyes if you have to. If you need to, gently remove your eyes and slip them into your bag.\n\n\n Do you see the car driving on the road? Good.\n\n\n Now, picture a destination. Any destination you want.\n\n\n No, that was incorrect. The correct destination was a clear and placid lake.\n\n\n So, all of you, out there, picture the car. Picture the road. Picture the clear and placid lake.\n\n\n And what I want you to do now is put the car in the lake.\n\n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple. Just imagine the car leaving the road, and now entering the lake.\n\n\n Leaving the road, entering the lake.\n\n\n Great.\n\n\n Are we all picturing the car in the lake? OK.\n\n\n City Council is notifying me that the test went perfectly, and that we all successfully murdered a lone driver using the collective willpower of our minds. Wow! Wow! The human mind is a powerful thing!\n\n\n This has been traffic.\n\n\n Reports are in that the first condo buyers nervously approached their acquisitions, those black cubes, giant, where once stood other places. The buyers edged toward them. They reached out their hands, trembling. They touched the smooth, cold walls of the cubes, and they saw.\n\n\n They saw.\n\n\n Janice Rio (from down the street) saw a city. A lost city. A dead city, nestled in a jungle \xe2\x80\x93 the kind of jungle that only ever existed in books written by people who have never seen a jungle. The city stood, and Janice stood, in perfect dread, its doors were open jaws. Its windows were open jaws. Its roads and avenues were gaping mouths and open jaws. That dead city teetered. It rotted in its jungle tomb, but\xe2\x80\xa6it was not empty. And she started to run. Run through the thick foliage of that absurd place, she shouted and ran.\n\n\n And then her hand slipped away from the condo, and it was all gone. And she fell to her knees weeping, as though she had lost something, although of course, she\xe2\x80\x99d never had anything at all.\n\n\n Roger Singh (who had been able to buy a condo with the spine) saw a cave, underwater, in an ocean far to the north. And the water around him was dark \xe2\x80\x93 so dark! \xe2\x80\x93 that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure even which way led to the surface, to life\xe2\x80\xa6and which way led down only to the deep silent. He gasped, but found he had no breath\xe2\x80\xa6and no need to breathe. And there was this cave that smoldered with a light, a light that was charged and alive. And shadows moved against the light, cast by\xe2\x80\xa6what?\xe2\x80\xa6within the cave. And then he swam towards it, uncertain whether he was guest, or sacrifice, or invulnerable dreamer. And he heard a song from the cave, and he knew it, and it was perfect. And he sang along, but at the same time, he had never heard that song before in his life. And what was life? What made it his? It all seemed so small, part of the world that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist anymore. And then he went backwards from the face of the condo, and the ocean and the cave vanished, and he stared up at the blue sky, as awash with light as the water around him had been dark.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cWas that a condo?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWas that what one is?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Another, Samantha Guzman, only screamed \xe2\x80\x94 her eyes bulging wider and wider, her hand clamped to the surface of the cube.\n\n\n So\xe2\x80\xa6it seems that move-in day is going pretty well so far!\n\n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s show is brought to you by the generous support of the following sponsors:\n\n\n \n The sun\n\n\n All other suns with their own planets and own possibilities\n\n\n A trail, winding its way into a thick wood\n\n\n The gesture [Cecil smacks the top of his own head \xe2\x80\x94 with flair]\n\n\n This bit of melody: [Cecil hums a tune not unlike (but also not like) the first few bars of Johnny Carson\xe2\x80\x99s Tonight Show theme]\n\n\n A&W Root Beer\n\n\n The slow disintegration of your body\n\n\n Light, in every form: visible, invisible, deadly, hidden\n\n\n\n Please help our show by supporting these sponsors, using chants and simple offerings.\n\n\n And now, more on the condo story.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Scuse me, uh, Cecil.\n\n\n Oh, yes, excuse me?\n\n\nSorry to interrupt, but\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\nCEASE SPEAKING AND TURN YOUR AMUSINGLY SHAPED EARS TO HEED MY BOOMING AND IMPRESSIVE VOICE!\n\n\nYeah, thank you, Green Head. Uh, hey, listeners! Hiram McDaniels, here. Mayoral candidate, noted five-headed dragon, and completely innocent of any trumped-up insurance fraud charges.\n\n\n Hello, Hiram. Uh, it\xe2\x80\x99s great to have you live in the studio, and also you, and you, and you, and you.\n\n\nGreat, yeah. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice that you had the, uh, Faceless Old Woman on just a bit ago, and uh, that hardly seems fair.\n\n\nCandidates must be given equal time on community radio. Says that in Section 12, Clause 3 of the Fairness Code we are all born with imprinted on our hearts.\n\n\n My apologies, you are perfectly right. That was my failing as a community radio host, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6hey, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little distracted. Um, oh! Can I ask you sort of um\xe2\x80\xa6a relationship question?\n\n\nNO, YOU BARELY-SENTIENT SACK OF FLESH AND FLUID!\n\n\nSorry, there, Cecil buddy, but we just don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time right now. Anyway, if it\xe2\x80\x99s OK with you, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to exercise my right as mayoral candidate by talking about the important subject of my favorite memory.\n\n\nNow, my favorite memory was when I was just 30 years old. Hardly half as big as I am now.\n\n\nWe were 43% of our current stature, give or take a decimal.\n\n\nGIVE IT OR TAKE IT, BLUE HEAD, GIVE IT OR TAKE IT! IT\xe2\x80\x99S YOUR NATURAL RIGHT!\n\n\nThank you, Purple Head.\n\n\nSo, there I was, standing on a city street. And not this city, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of Night Vale yet. I asked a man walking by on the street where a good place to eat was. You know what he said?\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\xa6know very little.\n\n\nHE HOWLED IN FEAR AND SCRAMBLED TO THE FRAGILE SHELTER OF THE NEAREST BUILDING! I ROARED! FILLED WITH SHAME AT THE EFFECT MY FORM HAD ON THESE JUDGING INSECTS!\n\n\nIt was a real bummer.\n\n\nWe cried, and\xe2\x80\x93 and we cried and we were still hungry, and we cried.\n\n\n Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\xa6nice favorite memory!\n\n\nOh, no, no, no, no, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my favorite memory, that was just, uh\xe2\x80\xa6what do you call it? Uh\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\nCONTEXT!\n\n\nYeah, context. Thanks, Green. Now, my favorite memory was when I was standing in a city \xe2\x80\x93 THIS city. I was standing in Night Vale. I had heard of it by then.\n\n\nWhispers! Rumors! Flying through the night on hot updrafts, with vague directions in my mind and nothing but miles of mad darkness all around me!\n\n\nUh, right, this place was real hard to find. So I was standing on the street, and I\xe2\x80\xa6I asked a man walking by where a good place to eat was. You know what he said?\n\n\n Nope, again, knowledge very limited here.\n\n\nHe said, well\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\n\n\nRight, Gray Head, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything! He just opened his mouth wider than a human is physically capable of doing, let out a loud hoot, pointed at the Moonlight All-Nite Diner. He just went about his day. No screamin\xe2\x80\x99, no fear.\n\n\nIT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING!\n\n\nNo, Green, it was magical! Finally, a place where what I looked like didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that I have trouble controlling my fire-breathing, or that the diner looked a bit far, and so I just ate the man instead. None of that mattered. Because I had found my home.\n\n\nWe had found our home.\n\n\nYeah. Exactly, yes. That is why I want to be mayor. Mayor of the first city that ever made me feel normal. Night Vale. As my campaign slogan says, I am literally a five-headed dragon. Who cares!\n\n\nI tell you, many many people care, and all over the world. But no one here! That\xe2\x80\x99s all that matters to me.\n\n\nAnd me!\n\n\nAND ME.\n\n\nAND ME.\n\n\nAND ME!\n\n\nThank you, listeners. Thank you, Cecil.\n\n\n No, thank you, Hiram. Um, that was a very nice story. Even if I did my very best to learn nothing from it.\n\n\nGOODBYE, BITE-SIZED CREATURE!\n\n\n Goodbye!\n\n\n Wow! Man, what a striking and charismatic dragon. Mm, mm-mm-mm. Where was I?\n\n\n Ah, yes. More now, on the condo story.\n\n\n Those people who have been given terrible visions by the condos are saying that they feel they must go back \xe2\x80\x93 go back to their condo. That something felt unfinished about what they saw. That even as they feel terrified, they must go back to see what it is will happen next.\n\n\n The Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Police are attempting to stop the condo owners by sending passive-aggressive messages via helicopter-borne loudspeaker.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d they are saying. \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead. Touch the cube again. I guess. I mean, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about your community, and your fellow citizens, then I guess you probably should. We won\xe2\x80\x99t miss you anyway! Like, no big deal. Touch the cube if you want!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And they are.\n\n\n Roger, Samantha, Janice Rio (from down the street) \xe2\x80\x93 they are touching the great black walls of the condo cubes, and the walls are rippling and bubbling as though liquid, like a pot of boiling squid ink, with darting lights, like distant dying stars. The hands of the people are pushing through into the space within, whatever that space is, and they are \xe2\x80\x93 one by one, and with varying degrees of hesitancy \xe2\x80\x93 entering their condos.\n\n\n Bystanders say that once inside, the human forms are going limp, and floating up into the center of the cubes, where they stay, paralyzed. Faces, slack. Eyes, glazed.\n\n\n A small sign has appeared outside of each cube that contains a person. The sign is red, and says in simple white lettering:\n\n\n Condos: A perfect kind of human A perfect kind of life Get yours today!\n\n\n Listeners, I cannot advise getting yours today. Not until we understand fully what these condos are. And, given our track record, we will likely never fully understand what they are. So it\xe2\x80\x99s best just to stay away.\n\n\n More on this as it develops. But first, a look at the Community Calendar.\n\n\n This Friday, the staff of Dark Owl Records will be holding a clearance sale. \xe2\x80\x9cEVERYTHING MUST GO!\xe2\x80\x9d they will declare on a bright banner with a thick font.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMusic is old! It\xe2\x80\x99s ancient! It cannot tell the stories of our lives, our souls, our societies any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d the banner will read. \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot mean anything! It cannot give you what you need! Buy this music, and eat this music!,\xe2\x80\x9d the banner will say in bright yellows and blues.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cTear it into plastic shards and swallow it! It knows not what it has wrought on our world!\xe2\x80\x9d the banner will exclaim to excited music lovers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it shred you from within as we laugh from without!\xe2\x80\x9d the banner will announce.\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9c40% off all CDs, 70% off all posters! Friday only!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Saturday afternoon is the opening of the new Kid\xe2\x80\x99s Unlearning Wing at the Museum of Forbidden Technologies. Well, this wing has been built, but no one is certain where. The museum staff says that they kids interested in unlearning all about forbidden technologies, as well as those kids who are uninterested\xe2\x80\xa6well, in fact, all children, the museum says, will eventually be chosen during sleep. They will wake up late one night in this new wing, experiencing all the magic and wonder of unlearning.\n\n\n Sunday morning, the Night Vale PTA will be holding a raffle. Tickets are only $2 each, and the winner (as usual) will never be heard from again.\n\n\n Monday has been rescheduled to Wednesday, and Wednesday has been doubled.\n\n\n Tuesday\xe2\x80\xa6oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, man. Uhh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to know.\n\n\n Or, you do want to know, but the powers that be don\xe2\x80\x99t even want you to know, so you can all just be properly surprised.\n\n\n This has been the Community Calendar.\n\n\n [phone rings]\n\n\n Hello?\n\n\n\n\nHello, Cecil. Are you there?\n\n\n\n\n Carlos? Hi. Umm, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the air. Um, I\xe2\x80\x99m still doing the show.\n\n\n\n\nRight, no, I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just\xe2\x80\xa6I got a condo. A condo for us. I was thinking that maybe we could\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\n\n Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait\xe2\x80\xa6for us? That we could\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what I thought it would be. It\xe2\x80\x99s a giant black cube, featureless, where the vacant lot behind the Ralph\xe2\x80\x99s used to be. I touched it, and I saw\xe2\x80\xa6I saw endless rows of Erlenmeyer flasks, and every one held a liquid, and all of the liquids were bubbling, and before each one was a notebook of numbers, and above was a dial with more numbers. I saw all of this, and I understood\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\n\n\n You touched the condo? Don\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch the condo! Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch it again! You know what? Hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right there!\n\n\n\n\nI need to get to those flasks. Each liquid was bubbling. There were numbers. I\xe2\x80\x99m going into the condo. The condo is perfect. It is perfect, and I understand.\n\n\n\n\n Carlos, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go in there! Carlos! Carlos! Hello?\n\n\n I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, um, I have \xe2\x80\x94 Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back really soon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back as soon as I can.\n\n\n But before I go, let me take you now to the weather.\n\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cRemember Us\xe2\x80\x9c by Gabriel Royal]\n\n\n\n\n Hello again, listeners. Cecil is still gone. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s just you and me now. You have no idea how often it is just you and me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned this new thing where I can silently skitter along your ceiling. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting perspective. I\xe2\x80\x99d show you, but\xe2\x80\xa6you can\xe2\x80\x99t see me. And anyway, I think maybe it would upset you to see a Faceless Old Woman skittering along your ceiling.\n\n\n There always seems to be something upsetting you. You should relax more. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing coming to get you, there\xe2\x80\x99s everything\xc2\xa0coming to get you\xe2\x80\xa6but relax anyway, just on principle.\n\n\n Lie down and look up at the ceiling \xe2\x80\x93 a ceiling on which you can see nothing skittering, even though there is something skittering, there are so many\xc2\xa0skittering creatures on your ceiling, but forget that.\n\n\n Lie down, and look up at the ceiling and breathe with those curiously fragile lungs of yours and remind yourself: Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. All is as it was meant to be. It was meant\xc2\xa0to be lonely and terrifying and unfair and fleeting. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\n\n\n Let me tell you a story.\n\n\n Once upon a time there was a young woman who had a face, and did not live in secret. She had a home of her own, and she always thought her life had some great purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not my life as it should be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, indicating her life as it was. \xe2\x80\x9cMy life is different from this. This is not it at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n And so, she sought out changes in her life. She changed careers, and romantic relationships, she changed houses and hair colors and still, her life was not what she was sure it should be. She changed more; she became more secretive. She watched how other people lived. Maybe one of them\xc2\xa0have a life that should belong to her.\n\n\n Soon, there was less and less of her. She was not living her own life, and so she was not living any life. It was harder and harder for people to see her, because there was less and less of her to see.\n\n\n And then she died.\n\n\n Oh, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me. I see the confusion here. No, that was a young woman I watched as I secretly lived in her home. I\xe2\x80\x93 I just found her story interesting, as I find so many stories interesting.\n\n\n Cecil should be back soon. I know you are hoping he is safe, and that the scientist is safe. I know. I\xe2\x80\x99m watching them right now, even as I speak to you. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. That is because I\xe2\x80\x99m also slightly malicious. Sorry about that.\n\n\n I should go now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x98go,\xe2\x80\x99 I am always\xc2\xa0with you. But I am going to stop talking now, let you forget about me. Let you find some reason to dismiss that movement in the corner of your eye. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably nothing. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably nothing, after all.\n\n\n\n\n Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m back. I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry for\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n By the time I got there, Carlos was floating in the cube, and there was that sign, \xe2\x80\x9ca perfect kind of human, a perfect kind of life.\xe2\x80\x9d Well\xe2\x80\xa6I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate, I jumped into that black cube after him, and instantly I saw. I saw great distances. I saw\xe2\x80\xa6ugh. Jagged mountains.\n\n\n I saw a dark planet lit by no sun. I saw shrouded figures standing on a beach in a circle, gently swaying into each other against the backdrop of a roiling, bottomless ocean.\n\n\n I saw all of this, and I understood!\n\n\n I understood that the cubes are perfect! I understood that this is how we become perfect. I understood that what I was seeing was the way to perfection. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I understood this. Thinking about it now, nothing about it seems good, let alone perfect.\n\n\n But inside the cube, within its chambers, it all makes sense. And I understood.\n\n\n And there was a moment. There was a moment, dear listeners, where I considered it. I considered joining Carlos and becoming perfect. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to know something after these months together with dear Carlos.\n\n\n Perfection isn\xe2\x80\x99t real. Perfection isn\xe2\x80\x99t human. And Carlos is not perfect, no. Even better \xe2\x80\x94 he is imperfect.\n\n\n Everything about him, and us, and all of this, is\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect! And those imperfections in our reality are the seams and the cracks into which our out-sized love can seep and pool. And sometimes we are annoyed, and disappointed, and that too is a part of how love works. It is not a perfect system, but\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n Oh, well.\n\n\n And so I resisted.\n\n\n I fought off the vision of the shrouded figures and the dark planet and all that was perfect and I held close to imperfection.\n\n\n To my imperfection.\n\n\n And to my imperfect Carlos.\n\n\n And I took him, and I carried him out of the cube. And we came up, heaving, into this world that will disappoint us.\n\n\n Finally, free.\n\n\n And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n Actually, I\xe2\x80\x93 I recorded the whole conversation. Of course. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m never without my microphone.\n\n\n He said,\n\n\n\n\n Cecil? I was thinking about the series of ongoing actions that we perceive as the present, and the amassing of memories that we treat as the living record of the past and the hopes and dreams and assumptions that we project as the future. I was thinking about time. And about how it means something to so many people, and about how it\xe2\x80\x99s so finite, and also so infinite.\n\n\n I was also thinking about space. About how it is nothing, and then, a point which is just a single spot within the nothing, and a line which separates the nothing into two nothings, and how a plane is a patch of nothing and an angle just where two nothings meet, but all those things combined, with an object of points, lines, planes, and angles, an object with length and width and depth that can take up actual space. Until that object becomes something made of nothing \xe2\x80\x93 within nothing.\n\n\n An object can be a wall, a floor, a roof, a bed, a table, a dog, a door, a rug, a\xe2\x80\xa6a home.\n\n\n And then, I thought about how a home is just a group of objects connected by a shared personal experience of time \xe2\x80\x93 our past, our present, our assumed future. A home is\xe2\x80\xa6I mean, uh, scientifically speaking, speaking form the point of view of mere facts and logic, and um\xe2\x80\xa6hmm. You know, what with science, and all\xe2\x80\xa6uhhh, I\xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x93 I just thought it was\xe2\x80\xa6time for us to\xe2\x80\xa6make a home together.\n\n\n\n\n And I said \xe2\x80\x9cYes! Yes! That would be, well, that would be neat!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n '
