131 - Brought to You by Kellogg’s
b'Today as all days, As every day of your life, Has been brought to you by Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Are you worthy? Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Hello, listeners. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having some real budget troubles here at the station, so it does seem that today\xe2\x80\x99s entire broadcast will be a sponsorship message from Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. I know that feels like a lot, but it was the only way to keep the station up and running.\n\n Station Management consumes three tons of soil from Paris each month! And it has been massively expensive digging it up and shipping it here. Not to mention all the bribes needed for government officials. All to say that Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s has agreed to pay for um, uh, let me check, OK. One month of soil shipments in exchange for us exclusively talking about them for the next three years.\n\n Uh. OK. Well that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the best bargain, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll consult the station\xe2\x80\x99s legal advisor and see if we can get out of that.\n\n Oh, our legal advisor is Laura, who is a server down at the Moonlite All-Nite Diner. Between shifts, she likes to read Wikipedia pages about, mm, law stuff, so we often go to her for her expert opinion. In the meantime, probably best for me to just do what the contract says. This explanation brought to you, of course \xe2\x80\x93 by Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to the news. John Peters \xe2\x80\x93 you know, the farmer \xe2\x80\x93 said that some folks came to his farm. They said they were from Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Said they heard that he grew the finest imaginary corn in the state. Said they were thinking of getting into imaginary Corn Flakes, and that they wanted to buy up his entire crop. He told them that he already had a deal with Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s, a good local cereal company, and that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back on his word. One of the folks from Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s squinted up at the sun, then spit on the ground through tight lips. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d that person said. \xe2\x80\x9cIii wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n To be honest, listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m now worried about Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s. \n\n And now the Community Calendar. This evening is the monthly school board meeting. Topics covered will include updating text books to contain words, rather than runes and diagrams of ritual dances. Hiring a new vice principal after that whole endless cave of suffering mess a few weeks ago, and replacing all food in the cafeteria with cereal. Scientists from the Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Institute say that most food has no nutritional value at all. Oh, wow. I did not know that. And that only cereal contains all the protein, vitamins and corn that a body needs to live. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n Thursday, the Boy Scouts are holding their summer bake sale. They will have bowls of cereal and nothing else. The cereal is not available to you. You are available to the cereal. \n\n Friday is now called Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s day. Mentioning the outdated name for Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Day will result in severe fines and disappearances. \n\n OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m actually getting some sort of urgent text from Carlos. Hm. He says that something I\xe2\x80\x99ve said recently is not scientifically accurate, but you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to check what. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s isn\xe2\x80\x99t paying me to text. Or maybe they are. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear what Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s wants from us.\n\n Saturday morning is the summer softball league\xe2\x80\x99s weekly game, pitting Steve Carlsberg\xe2\x80\x99s Happy Hyeenas against Susan Willman\xe2\x80\x99s Garbage Dump Team. That\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0not the actual name of the team, but it should be. Ugh, Susan Willman! Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s will be sponsoring the game by replacing the softballs with fistfuls of Apple Jaks and sending employees to hurl boxes of cereal at players. \n\n Sunday afternoon in Grove Park, Sarah Sultan will be offering free meditation classes. Sarah is, of course, a fist-sized river rock, and so is extraordinarily good at staying still and silent. And she wants to pass these skills onto you. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s will place a six-inch deep layer of Special K over the entire park, for reasons that are their own.\n\n The Night Vale Metereological Society has issued an extreme heat watch for Monday, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desert. In August. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be hot as heck on Monday, and all other days.\xe2\x80\x9d Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s suggests using the sun to cook up some Rice Krispie treats by building a simple solar energy panel and using that to power an electric oven.\n\n And please, set aside all of Tuesday, as Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s has indicated that they have use for us, all of us, on Tuesday. And then Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s made this hollow dry laugh that sounded like it came from a long dormant stone well. \n\n This has been the Community Calendar. \n\n In other news, Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s executives announced that they are going to stand strong against this current Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s encroachment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are citizens of Night Vale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Leopold Tuesdale. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been through a lot of terrifying stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real weird town. We\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid of a competing cereal company.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he yelped, as the closet in his office opened and the folks from Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s came out. One of them squinted up at the sun, then spit on the office floor through lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d the person said. And then the Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s group left the office while Leopold sputtered about how they got in, and why anybody would ever spit on another person\xe2\x80\x99s floor. \n\n Next up, we have traff- oh, oop, nope, OK. Um, [clears throat] I\xe2\x80\x99m being told that traffic has been replaced today by our new segment.\n\n Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\xa6 pleased to bring you Common Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Questions, in which you ask questions and I answer them, with off the cuff answers that are not written down for me on these carefully scripted cards. \n\n Question number one: How much is too much cereal? My off-hand answer: How much is too much life? How much is too much love? Would you deny yourself blood in your veins? Would you deny yourself dreams in your evenings? There is not too much. There is only ever the deposit and the longing. \n\n OK, question number two: Sometimes it seems my cereal boxes are watching me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how else to describe, they-they don\xe2\x80\x99t have eyes or anything, and they\xe2\x80\x99re just sitting there, but it feels like they\xe2\x80\x99re watching me. Just improvising here, but: Certain measures are taken for your own good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. it\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \n\n And question number three: Is this coupon for Frosted Mini Wheats still usable? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it since, like, 2007 but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a date on it. Is it still good? In answer to your questions and for your extemporaneous listening pleasure: Here are ten seconds of a person eating cereal, recorded really really close to their mouth. [crunching noises]\n\n This has been Common Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Questions. \n\n Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s just keep this going. [clears throat] Health tips. Did you know that Corn Flakes cure most cancers? The reason you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. But we have made a person on the radio say it to you, and now you will remember that he said it and forget that he said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true. Because our minds are fallible and easily manipulated. Okey, this is just insulting. Do I really have to\xe2\x80\xa6 [whispering] Station Management is not happy about my endangering their soil shipment, so let\xe2\x80\x99s just keep moving.\n\n Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive Leopod Tuesdale has vanished under mysterious circumstances. A white van with a Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s logo pulled up to him as he walked to his car, and a group of people hustled him into a burlap sack and the burlap sack into the van. One of the people stopped to squint up at the sun and then spit on the ground through tight lips, before jumping in and the van roaring off. So I am being ordered by our current sponsors to report that nothing is know about Leopold\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance and there are no clues indicating what happened. You know, probably he just got scared about the quality of his competitors\xe2\x80\x99 products and fled. Happens all the time! All the time, Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s has asked me to repeat. \n\n Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what kind of weather Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s has deigned to give you.\n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cStandard Deviation\xe2\x80\x9d by Danny Schmidt]\n\n [booming noise] In the beginning, there was nothing. There was not nonexistent or existent. There was no realm of air, no sky beyond it. What covered in and where, and what gave shelter? Was water there unfathomed, depth of water? Darkness was upon the face of the deep, death was not then, nor was there (ought) immortal. \n\n Then, there was Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Nothing became something. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s spread and formed. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s became the planets and the stars. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s gathered into long strands to become the arms of galaxies, an infinity of Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. Space made tangible out of the empty. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s became soil and water, it became trees and it became birds, and it learned to sing and it learned to speak. \n\n The first man rose and found the first woman waiting for him, and her name was Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and his name was Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and they shouted in horror at their own mortal forms. \n\n Later, there were cities and before that, there were communities. And it all came from Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s and was of Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s and belonged to Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. The people knelt and they gave a joyful thanks for their own creation, but Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s could not hear. It was a heaving dumb creature and it created out of a natural impulse, like how humans bleed, like how birds bleed, like how trees bleed. It did not create out of benevolence. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s is not benevolent. It is not evil, either. It is a stone. It is a star. It is every empty distance between the stones ad the stars. It is not capable of morality. It. Is. Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. It is \xe2\x80\x93 forever. \n\n Once, long ago, the first king looked out over the first kingdom. It was not a very big kingdom, but then, there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of people at that time. Great empires would come later, but at that moment, the world was very small, a stretch of grassland near water. And the person who held that grass land was the king. And the grassland became a kingdom. There were titles given and borders erected. The king felt that he had created something great here, that his name would ring out forever. No one knows his name now. Even 100 years after his death, it was forgotten. The only name that rings out forever \xe2\x80\x93 is Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. \n\n Once, there was a farmer who lived at the edge of a forest, and she worked her fields. She would look at the forest with longing, because it seemed to her that her life was built only of routines and chores, and that these were the walls that boxed her in. And that by monopolizing her days, these routines were killing her. They were killing her in the sense that they were taking her entire life away from her, and she felt that if she ever got the nerve, one Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s day evening, she would run into the forest. Maybe it would be scary in there, probably dangerous. She would be less comfortable than she was on the farm, but she would also be truly herself. It was all waiting for her in the forest. She never ran into it. Later, she died while working one of her fields. This story doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The only thing that matters \xe2\x80\x93 is Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. \n\n Years from now, the universe will disperse. The stars will dim, running out of the energy imbued to them when it all exploded. Planets will become cold rock and molecules will stop forming, and atoms will stop vibrating and it will be still. It will be still forever. Or at least until the next thing. And nothing from this thing will ever see the next thing. [whispers, inaudible] Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s will watch the universe (-) to (fire) and will help it lay itself to rest. [quietly] And Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s will wait in the darkness. Will wait as long as it needs to. Forever, or what a human would perceive as forever. Maybe it will wait for ten times as long as this universe ever existed, but eventually, it will stir. There will be water there, unfathomed depth of water. Darkness will be upon the face of the deep, and it will all start anew. \n\n There is a town, and that town is called Night Vale. It exists on a plane in a desert surrounded by the Scrub Lands and the Sand Wastes. Above us are lights that flit about. When they (peer), we (peer) back, wonderingly. We are simple, and we love each other, and we conceal secrets and we hold multitudes, and in this way we are like anyone. We live lives that are rich with meaning and awe. Or we live lives that are heavy with torment and worry, or we live lives that pass by like a Wednesday afternoon and we reach the end and say, \xe2\x80\x9coh my God, was that it?\xe2\x80\x9d And it was. \n\n We are a community. Like the king, we have made the world smaller, and in claiming this tiny corner as our entire world, we have created a kingdom. Like the farmer, we eye the forest and contemplate what could be out there if we ever left, if we ever went. But few of us do. And like the universe, we are brought to us \xe2\x80\x93 by Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. We belong to Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and we are made of Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. We cannot understand Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s, and that may be because the mystery is too complex. Or, it may be because it is as simple as a monolith, and truly there is nothing to understand. \n\n Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s is no more. The company has been bought out, with no management left to resist the hostile takeover. It is now a research wing of Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s, designed to test out a concept that Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s says they have just invented all on their own. Which is a line of cereal meant for night time only. The new head of this division squinted up at the sun, then spit on their own office floor through tight lips before saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIi wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about Flakey-O\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n That\xe2\x80\x99s it for our sponsored show.\n\n Remember: today has been brought to you \xe2\x80\x93 by Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s. And Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s can take today away. \n\n Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: Keep your eye on the ball. Keep your lungs on the court. Leave your stomach in the locker room.'
