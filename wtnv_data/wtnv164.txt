That presence is located in the Night Vale mall and is called the Burger Barn Gladtown Records Express. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you shopping there, Night Vale, and I want you to know you\xe2\x80\x99re all murderers with the figurative blood of independent record stores dripping from your hands. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x9d you\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t figurative blood, it\xe2\x80\x99s literal barbeque sauce from the Black Angus barbeque bacon burger and it\xe2\x80\x99s delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d You\xe2\x80\x99ll keep blathering on how about \xe2\x80\x9cBurger Barn Gladtown Records Express keeps thick juicy beef burgers layered in between your albums, so you can flip past them and impulse eat as you shop. It\xe2\x80\x99s so convenient!\xe2\x80\x9d [angrily] Well you know what? Convenience is another words for laziness. When you come to my store, to Dark Owl Records, you have to earn your music! Our extensive underground section is kept literally underground, and you have to dig random holes in the dirt to find it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t provide you with a shovel, you can\xe2\x80\x99t even bring your own. You must use your fingers. Broken knuckles and fingernails peeled back to the quick are the sign of a true music lover. Sometimes, you won\xe2\x80\x99t find music you think you like, but then you realize that the rhythmic grunts and scrapes of bloodied hands into rocky earth is itself music.\n\n Anyway, come to my fundraiser tonight at Dark Owl Records. It\xe2\x80\x99s a party, and parties are the worst, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the money to pay my bills anymore and it\xe2\x80\x99s your fault, so just show up and do the right thing, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out of business. Ok, thanks!\n\n Cecil: Thank you, Michelle. Our radio station is doing a remote broadcast live today at the Save Dark Owl fundraiser. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do some interviews and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be live bands, and it should be a lot of fun. Hope you see you down here, Night Vale! Come show your support for local small business.\n\n But first, a word from our sponsor. Today\xe2\x80\x99s program is brought to you by the Burger Barn Gladtown Records Express. The popular franchise mashup had its grand opening only three weeks ago and is already a booming success. From their regional frosty treats, like the cactus thorn malt, to their wide selection of best of complication albums. There\xe2\x80\x99s something for everyone at Food Barn Gladtown Records Express. And by popular demand, there\xe2\x80\x99s now extra fry sauce on everything, including the Bluetooth headphones. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to ask for it. You have to ask if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want fry sauce, and you have to give a good reason why not, like uh, a signed doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note. Burger Barn Gladtown Records Express. Your community entertainment culture conglomerate. \n\n And now, a public service announcement.\n\n Deb: Hey old friends! Corporeal humans, cor-corporeal humans, former babies, future corpses, this is Deb, a sentient patch of haze, speaking for the department of motor vehicles. We know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from us in a while. But [blows raspberry] we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from you either. Relationships are a, [clicks tongue] two-way street, so to speak. But [hiccups], I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been some tension and things have gotten a little weird between us. No need to get into that right now. Or ever again, as far as we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned. But if you wanna come over some time and just talk, just say hi or anything, then the department of motor vehicles will be opening our doors for one hour every weekday between 2 and 3. That\xe2\x80\x99s all we have to give emotionally right now. Self..care. We would like to see you again though just to [emotionally] hear your voice. We hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing well. [hiccups] We\xe2\x80\x99re a little drunk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s late. Man, we just got done watching Carol for the third time in a week. [angrily] And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t really been posting on social media lately, so we just wanna know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with you. [drinking noises] Again, no pressure, no strings attached, and if it gets crowded you could always take a number as usual. But the DMV wants you to know whether your number 19 or 99, you\xe2\x80\x99re always number 1 to us! [snorts] [cries] We, we miss you. We miss you. \n\n Cecil: Listeners, we\xe2\x80\x99re here live at Dark Owl Records, and the fundraiser is getting off to a great start! People are buying shards of records they dug out of the ground, there\xe2\x80\x99s a cake with thick black frosting and undulating tendrils. Mm, looks delicious! There\xe2\x80\x99s an effigy of the Burger Barn Gladtown Records Express with a lot of long pins sticking out of it. And at the center of all the excitement is Dark Owl owner herself, Michelle Nguyen, and her girlfriend Maureen. What a treat! Hey you two, wanna say hello to all of Night Vale? Ah that\xe2\x80\x99s weird. Uh, Michelle sent me a text right now while simultaneously staring unblinkingly into my eyes from three feet away. Uh, her text says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe heard the spot you did for Burger Barn Gladtown Rec Ex and we are not speaking to you at this time. Please leave my party, Cecil.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh I get it, oh no, this is a, a simple misunderstanding, Michelle. See, in radio journalism, we have a moral responsibility to play ads and make lots of money. I see where you\xe2\x80\x99re confused. Does that help clear things up? Aaand Maureen is pouring ice coffee all over my laptop. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go find a towel, while you go to the weather.\n\n [A Pale Sun Rises Over New York" contentious="" control="" conversation="" cool="" cornered="" corporation="" corrupted="" could=""
