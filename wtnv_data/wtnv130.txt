b'I once was lost. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with that.\n\n Welcome to Night Vale.\n\n Steve Carlsberg: Ahem. First I wanted to say that there are glowing arrows in the sky. You can\xe2\x80\x99t see them even though you should. I can see them.\n\n There are dotted lines and arrows and circles. The sky is a chart that explains the entire world. For reference, I printed up this diagram on poster board. Notice the arrows here, which curve around the circles. And the dotted lines. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear if you just look at it.\n\n Please look at it. You\xe2\x80\x99re not looking at it!\n\n Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it here on this easel and you can look at it later. Or while I\xe2\x80\x99m talking. Lots of people like to look at other things while I\xe2\x80\x99m talking. It puts them at ease. \n\n I say things people don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear. I show people things they don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see. My brother-in-law sometimes says I give off a smell that people don\xe2\x80\x99t like to smell. Well, I thought it was funny. [chuckles] It hurt my feelings a bit, but he kept doing it. I mean it was kinda funny, I guess?\n\n Cecil Palmer: Fun fact. Did you know that a group of dragons is called a \xe2\x80\x9cweyr\xe2\x80\x9d? A pride of lions, a murmuring of starlings, an ennui of buffalo, and a weyr of dragons. Interesting, right? \n\n And now the news. There\xe2\x80\x99s a weir of five-headed dragons burning down City Hall right now. There is another weir of dragons stomping great holes in Route 800, the only highway leading out of Night Vale. And yet one more weir \xe2\x80\x93 did you know that it\xe2\x80\x99s also correct to refer to this as a \xe2\x80\x9cflight\xe2\x80\x9d of dragons or even a \xe2\x80\x9cthunder\xe2\x80\x9d of dragons? \xe2\x80\x93 tearing open the aqueducts along the town reservoir. More on the complete annihilation of our city, as this story develops. \n\n Mm. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten several frustrated calls and letters about our program a couple of weeks ago. Because the program was called \xe2\x80\x9cA Story about Huntokar\xe2\x80\x9d, many listeners rightly anticipated a story about Huntokar. But all they heard was radio static over faint sounds of inhuman screaming. We apologize for the disappointment, and we will more closely review any programs before putting them on the air. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was a tough time for you to voluntarily listen to a sub-par radio program.\n\n [sighs] The town is.. nearly empty, save for flaming buildings, irate dragons, and a sky that has all but been replaced by an enormous hole, out of which pours continuous darkness, confounding visions and a deafening ripping noise, but again, sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that one\xe2\x80\xa6 radio show. \n\n In related news, the city is in fire, and completely in control of Hadassah McDaniels and the five-headed dragons. The holes that have torn across our sky have merged into one giant hole, and false realities are converging into our town. Many citizens, including our Mayor, have chosen to run from their own unpleasant reality towards some more pleasant options offered up by the collapsing of all space and time into one. Frances Donaldson, owner of the Antiques Mall, said she discovered a reality where antiques were not sentient, venomous creatures but in fact, just old items one could resell. Frances left this Night Vale last week to go live in another Night Vale, which occupies the exact same space. \n\n Bob Sturm, vice president of finance for the Night Vale Auto Insurance company, found a reality where cars were made of Stilton cheese, and another where insurance executives made almost 2000 dollars more year on average. He\xe2\x80\x99s still weighing which reality better suits his lifestyle. \n\n Steve Carlsberg: I see you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at my chart now! I think I should have gone with a classier font like Helvetica, but this one looks just like the writing in comic strips! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so funny! [laughs] Makes all of these terrible messages so much easier to bare!\n\n These arrows and lines in the sky are a message from someone named Huntokar. I learned this on the radio last week. Is she a god as she claims? Maybe, although I\xe2\x80\x99m not religious. The folks over at the Joyous Congregation said there is no god but the Smiling God. I asked if she could be the smiling god, and they asked if she was smiling. I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, it was on the radio. They made weird gestures with their fists and told me I would know once we were all devoured. \n\n I asked my other brother-in-law who\xe2\x80\x99s a scientist, and he said the arrows and lines were probably a bunch of comets or solar flares or possibly an aurora. Then he got really excited about talking about space, and skipped away while laughing and clutching his hands to his chest, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if there\xe2\x80\x99s a natural explanation. \n\n What I do know is I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who can see them. For a long time, I thought that I was. I told Cecil and he scoffed. I told Leann Hart at the Daily Journal, and she threw a hatchet at me. I showed them to my daughter Janice, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a teenager and isn\xe2\x80\x99t really interested in what her parents are interested in. My wife said she believed me, but showed little interest so \xe2\x80\x93 I think she was just saying that to be nice. \n\n I told Mayor Cardinal and Mayor Winchell before her. Mayor Cardinal said she would look into it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m positive she never did. Mayor Winchell totally agreed and got really excited about it, but she started telling me about how there\xe2\x80\x99s a man that lives in the Sun, and all he does all day is sit at a little table with a phone on it. The phone isn\xe2\x80\x99t plugged in, but he waits and waits for it to ring. The man often says to no one, because the Sun is so loud and hot an large no one can hear him: [old man voice] \xe2\x80\x9cI will receive the call. I cannot leave for I do not have an anshwering machine. But when that phone rings, boy howdy will that be shplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d Based on this story, I\xe2\x80\x99m positive Mayor Winchell and I were talking about different things.\n\n For a long time, I thought all of these people didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. They politely or impolitely urged me away from that line of conversation. They said \xe2\x80\x9csure sure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno way\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got something on your shirt\xe2\x80\x9d, and then they poked my nose when I looked down. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the angels in a second. I promise this relates. \n\n Cecil Palmer: An update on the estate of Old Woman Josie. The hearing to decide the legal ownership of Josie\xe2\x80\x99s estate has been postponed indefinitely, as City Hall is completely overrun with dragons, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not letting anyone schedule the hearing room. Not even for, like, 30 minutes. Josie\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Allondra Ortiz and her lawyer, Emilio Tavarez, have claimed that in the absence of a will, the estate should go to the next of kin, in this case Allondra. However, the angels who cared for Josie in her final years have claimed that they have joined ownership and stake in Josie\xe2\x80\x99s assets, as they built and maintained her home and helped develop Josie\xe2\x80\x99s cultural foundation. The angels\xe2\x80\x99 biggest hurdle so far in this ugly battle is that they legally \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t exist. As they are angels. The Hall of Public Records is holding a hearing today to determine the validity of the angels\xe2\x80\x99 existence and whether to officially recognize their being. We\xe2\x80\x99ll report back when a decision has been reached.\n\n Steve Carlsberg: But it\xe2\x80\x99s not that people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. They do believe me. You believe me. You just can\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, acknowledge it and understand it. We have customers in our bank all the time who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know their account balance. We can just print it on their receipt, but they always decline because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know there\xe2\x80\x99s only 168 dollars and rent is due in a week. They know, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to acknowledge it. \n\n Which brings me to the angels. They\xe2\x80\x99re real. You can see them. They\xe2\x80\x99re standing at the back of the room right now! And yes, I hear the city\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cangels acknowledged\xe2\x80\x9d sirens, and I see you Sheriff Sam, sitting right there in the front row, taking out your handcuffs. But there they are in the back of the room. Just turn around! Look! They\xe2\x80\x99re super tall, and have several arms and long faces and wings. You see them? They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that glow bright black and sound like French horns. Yeah, them. Wave at them. They\xe2\x80\x99re waving back!\n\n There are a great many crises facing our town. The holes in the sky, the dragons chasing us into hiding, The Woman of Italy threatening to flay us alive. The Distant Prince slowly creeping less distant. All of the unrepaired pot holes, all kinds of stuff that may seem more important than a simple clerical matter of existence. But I ask the city officials present, the administrators of the Hall of Public Records, the people of Night Vale, please legalize the acknowledgement of these angels! They are protectors. They have saved our city from evil corporate encampments, from that beagle. They built us an Opera House. They cared for Old Woman Josie through hospice. They are recorders. They memorize our history without judgment. They are beggars. They have like a billion dollars in our bank, but they constantly roam the streets asking people for ten bucks. It\xe2\x80\x99s not because they need money, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they need connection. They just want to know you heard them ask. \n\n [thunder and banging noises]\n\n Cecil Palmer:: Listeners, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting word that the dragons have stopped their rampage across town. No more burning buildings or crushed cars of devouring of pets. Every single dragon in town has gathered out in the Scrub Lands near the Sand Wastes. They are facing outward toward the mountains, silently watching \xe2\x80\x93 for something. \n\n The city is quiet again. I do take some comfort in not hearing shouts for help or glass shattering. It is a relief to not hear reptilian roars or car alarms, to not see plumes of smoke. There\xe2\x80\x99s so little solace, an inexplicable peace. The chaos in our streets was \xe2\x80\x93 normal, predictable. I mean it was upsetting, but we knew why it was happening. But for no clear reason, the dragons have stopped. Something they have not done since they began months ago. \n\n The last remnants of the sky\xe2\x80\xa6 have gone. There are hundreds of people out wandering the streets, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually here. They\xe2\x80\x99ve living in some other Night Vale that is not attacked by dragons, some other reality that is not in flames, I-I-I-I can see them. Solid figures moving through \xe2\x80\x93 each other. Unaware of the layers, upon layers, of reality. \n\n My brother returned to see me last night. But I do not have a brother. Nearly all of his hair and teeth were gone and he could barely walk. Every few steps he would fall only to get back up and walk slowly again toward me. Line of dried blood down the front of his polo shirt. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, only groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bomb\xe2\x80\x9d, over and over. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bomb!\xe2\x80\x9d He grabbed my arm. And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull away, I only said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not real.\xe2\x80\x9d But he just stared distantly, as only a person who has seen death can stare. \n\n People ask me all the time, \xe2\x80\x9care we at the end? Is this it?\xe2\x80\x9d And I tell them no. We must keep moving forward, that\xe2\x80\x99s all we can do. But\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m lying. I can hold tight to what I think is real here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s done no good, I\xe2\x80\x99m just one person. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.. we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken it. We\xe2\x80\x99ve. Broken. Night Vale. I am so sorry. \n\n Stay tuned next for\xe2\x80\xa6 everything. Nothing. And for one, last time, from the voice of your town to all listeners out there: Goodbye, Night Vale. Goodbye. \n\n [end music, silence]\n\n Hang on. I just thought of something. While I figure this out, have a listen to today\xe2\x80\x99s weather. \n\n [\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone I Know Will Die\xe2\x80\x9d by Erin Lovett.\xc2\xa0soundcloud.com/erinlovett]\n\n Steve Carlsberg: Unless we pay attention to our true reality, all will be lost. I believe recognizing angels is a vital first step. It\xe2\x80\x99s like my brother-in-law saying mean things all the time. I tried to ignore the mean bits, I just put my head down and kept moving. The main thing was to keep moving, not to bog down in tears and fights and emotions. Just move forward, because facing it would mean pain. \n\n But then a few weeks ago, I looked him in the eye and said, \xe2\x80\x9cStop.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked shocked. I inhaled and just as I did, he did too. And in a synchronous moment of breath, I started crying. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t weeping in sadness, I was just crying from the intimacy of truly seeing someone and having them see me. We were vulnerable and raw and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts me when you joke. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like me, just tell me why and we can work through it.\n\n And he told me about his childhood and his mother, and his tumultuous relationship with his sister, and how difficult it is to let strangers into his world. And it was just easier for him to keep me as an interloper in his life. I could never understand his difficult childhood. And I said he was right, but that I could try. \n\n He let me hug him. He even hugged back, which is rare for Cecil. He stopped saying rude jokes about me. In fact, even saying nice things about me. We acknowledged our issues. Nothing is perfect, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be, but it is better. Perfection doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist! All we can hope for is better. Thank you, officers of the Hall of Public Records, for letting me speak at the hearing here today. \n\n Cecil Palmer: My brother-in-law Steve Carlsberg didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Old Woman Josie, not like I did. I loved her like a mother. Steve did not know the angels, either. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he had heard me talk about them, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure like all of us he had seen them, and known them to be real, but averted his eyes for fear of violating the arcane law against acknowledging angels. Yet, he went to the hearing to support them. Because I am doing the show today, I could not attend the hearing. A hearing I desperately wanted to be at, to proclaim my passion, to change our out of date laws. I am sad I could not. \n\n But Steve told me he would speak for me at the hearing. He listened attentively as I told him everything I felt about the issue, and then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the arrows in the sky, the-the dotted lines\xe2\x80\x9d, and I rolled my eyes, because Steve has always been a conspiracy theorist, seeing patterns where there are none. He got upset at my dismissiveness. \n\n Um, [sighs] my sister Abby and I rarely got along, but after our mother died, that began to change. I spent so much time with her, and with her infant daughter Janice, whose spina bifida was costly and and and terrifying and exhausting. And then Abby met Steve, and Steve took care of Janice financially, and of Abby spiritually, and I was just an uncle again. I was no longer wringing my hands every day over the health of this struggling girl anymore, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t spending away my savings on medical care, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having to comfort a sobbing mother. And Steve took all that away from me. You can read that two ways. Steve relieved me from stress or, Steve relieved me from duty. I interpreted it as the latter. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to forgive him for simply being a responsible father and stepfather but\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m learning to let my anger go. \n\n I\xe2\x80\x99ve said terrible things about Steve. And he\xe2\x80\x99s been nothing but supportive of me, of my sister, of my niece. He is a good father, and brother-in-law, and a good citizen of Night Vale. He is a patient friend, and I love him for that. I think, I even think his arrows in the sky theory might be right. \n\n Did you- did you ever have one of those dolls that opens up, and inside is another doll, and inside that another? I, uh\xe2\x80\xa6 I sometimes think we are one of those dolls, inside a similar doll and outside a similar doll. Each one nestled in another, infinite possible dolls all in one visible doll. But all of the dolls have been opened and removed from one another. They\xe2\x80\x99re split halves strewn across the floor. Which parts go together? And which doll are we? Did our doll have the blond hair or the brown hair? The red bow or the one with the green-laced trim, the headscarf with the floral print? Or the dotted print? \n\n The angels hearing is completed, and the Hall of Public Records has officially recognized the existence of angels as Night Vale citizens. The angels celebrated with poorly aimed high-fives, which were warmly reciprocated by fellow non-angel citizens, now legally allowed to see the angels as real. \n\n The recognition and acknowledgement of angels seems a small victory, in light of our ending world, but as I speak to you now\xe2\x80\xa6 [softly] part of the sky has returned.\n\n Ah, as has Hiram McDaniels. Out in the Scrublands, the gathered dragons welcomed back one of their own. Hiram had left town to be alone, to gather himself. His Violet head was executed by Night Vale officials last year \xe2\x80\x93 the incident that sparked this entire conflict. Hiram spoke to the other dragons. \xe2\x80\x9cA great injustice has been perpetrated upon me,\xe2\x80\x9d his Gold head announced in a quiet, tired voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make sense of why it happened,\xe2\x80\x9d his Blue head said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been very emotional,\xe2\x80\x9d his Grey head said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are learning to let go of our anger,\xe2\x80\x9d his Green had shouted hoarsely. Hiram asked that the dragons leave Night Vale and all return back to their world. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have truces to uphold. They attacked me only because they are scared of me,\xe2\x80\x9d his Gold head said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot find forgiveness in relentlessness.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a grumbling in dissent. But the dragons have called off their attack for now. \n\n But it was not the dragons who tore open our sky and split our relaities. We are not safe merely because there is peace. We are the ones who tore apart our realities by refusing to see them for what they were. Our years of denial, carefully cultivated, has made our reality fragile. Look at the angels, Night Vale, they are real. They always have been, right there in front of us they are \xe2\x80\x93 our protectors and we denied them. We loved Old Woman Josie so much and yet, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept those whom she loved as her own family. Look what we did to Hiram! He conspired to kill our Mayor, but the one head that tried to stop the others? Was the one we executed. And in the throes of our town\xe2\x80\x99s iron-clad denial, we could not own up to our mistake. \n\n It\xe2\x80\x99s one wooden doll inside many similar wooden dolls, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t notice the little details\xe2\x80\xa6 we won\xe2\x80\x99t know which one we are when they are all dismantled. As the dragons began to leave our town, Mayor Dana Cardinal approached them and asked for forgiveness for the death of Violet. \xe2\x80\x9cThe destruction of our town did not bring Violet back, it did not fix anything. I remain fearful and angry at you for this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that does not change the fact that I made a grave error. Hiram. I am sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d The dragons paused to hear her words, and when she finished, they left Night Vale without reply. And a bit of the sky returned. \n\n Following the hearing, Allondra Ortiz said she was incredibly moved by the angels\xe2\x80\x99 case, that she had never really thought of them as anything but imaginary freeloaders. But now that she had taken time to see how much love and effort they put into Josie\xe2\x80\x99s health, life, and artistic endeavours, she plans to rework her claim on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s estate to include only personal items and heirlooms. She also said she would like to stay in Night Vale a little while longer, spend time with her mother\xe2\x80\x99s friends. And a bit of the sky returned.\n\n Members of the Vague Yet Menacing Government Agency resumed their routine of following people and recording private conversations, and those under surveillance waved hello at the agents. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d we all asked each other, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are being watched by secret agents? That\xe2\x80\x99s not normal, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in normal places.\xe2\x80\x9d And a bit of the sky returned. \n\n The librarians slithered - or possibly skittered? \xe2\x80\x93 back into the library, ready to devour book lovers. The City Council returned to their chambers after a much needed vacation in the Catskills, except for their newest member, 16-year-old Tamika Flynn who, instead of vacationing amassed a disturbing amount of weaponry. \xe2\x80\x9cMost towns, I think, aren\xe2\x80\x99t run by literal monsters and heavily armed teenagers,\xe2\x80\x9d we said to each other. And a bit of the sky returned. \n\n The radiation-sick man in my home named Cal is gone, once again. As are the countless layers of people walking our streets, but existing in some other streets. \n\n As the angels were acknowledged as truly existing, the other realities began to fade, as we began to accept the full reality of our world. As Mayor Cardinal remembered that her father had died years ago, and the father she was with was not her reality. As we looked each doll over carefully, we began to truly notice the fine details of what made ours particular and special. We could nestle them all back together into a single doll, each multitude safely contained. And the last bit of the sky - returned. \n\n Now our reality is badly damaged, and the only thing keeping it together is our acknowledgement. Finally, this \xe2\x80\x93strange- town that we live in, no more denial. We must see ourselves clearly, or risk losing ourselves forever.\n\n [gleefully] Angels are real. Our town is a deeply weird place. We know and acknowledge that it is a deeply weird place. There are dotted lines and arrows in the sky, and I love my family. And I love my brother Steve, he was right about everything, he always has been.\n\n So stay tuned next for eye contact and breathing, in unison. And as always, and for as long as I can keep saying it: Good night, Night Vale, Good night. \n\n Today\xe2\x80\x99s proverb: If you only read one book this year, then you have reached your approved book quota.'
